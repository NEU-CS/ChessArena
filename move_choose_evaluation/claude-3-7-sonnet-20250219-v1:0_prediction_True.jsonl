These are very dangerous and could quickly promote if not addressed. My king is far away on a6, so I can't help defend against these pawns directly.\n\nLet's consider my options:\n1. Capture with g4f5 - This would eliminate one of Black's passed pawns but give Black a passed f-pawn\n2. Push my g-pawn with g4g5 - Not a legal move in this position\n3. Advance my king toward the kingside - Options like a6b5 or a6b6\n4. Push my queenside pawns to create counterplay\n\nThe most urgent concern is Black's passed pawns.

Let's consider the best approach:\n\n1. I could advance the g4 pawn with g4g5, but there's no immediate need\n2. I could move the rook to control more squares or prepare for checkmate\n3. I could move the king to support the pawns' advance\n\nThe most effective strategy here is to use the rook to restrict Black's king while advancing my pawns. The h-file is a good place for the rook as it controls the back rank.\n\nMoving the rook to h8 (h6h8) would control the back rank and prepare for a potential promotion of the g-pawn. This keeps the Black king cut off and maintains maximum control.\n\n```\nh6h8\n```", "parsed_uci": "h6h8", "legal_moves": ["h6h8", "h6h7", "h6g6", "h6f6", "h6e6", "h6d6", "h6c6", "h6b6", "h6a6", "h6h5", "h6h4", "h6h3", "h6h2", "h6h1", "g1h2", "g1f2", "g1h1", "g1f1", "g4g5", "g2g3"], "top_moves": ["g4g5", "h6f6", "h6a6"], "system": "\nYou are an expert chess player.

However, I need to verify if e5 is reachable by the queen from h8 in one move (it should be since they're on the same diagonal).\n\nActually, looking at the legal moves list, h8e5 isn't listed, which means there must be a piece blocking that diagonal.\n\nLet me reconsider.

If Kh4, then Rf4+ isn't mate because the king can escape to h5. If Kf4, the rook on f2 is hanging.\n\nLet me reconsider.

The g2 pawn is an immediate threat to promote\n2. The c2 pawn is also dangerous but further from promotion\n3. Black's king is far away from both pawns, so cannot directly support them\n4. White's rook can control promotion squares\n\nCritical moves to consider:\n- Taking control of the g1-g8 file with Rg8 to prevent g1=Q\n- Capturing the g2 pawn with Rxg2\n- Moving the king to g2 to capture the pawn\n\nThe most urgent threat is the g2 pawn. If I don't address it immediately, Black could promote. Since the king can capture it directly with Kg2, this seems like the most straightforward solution.
