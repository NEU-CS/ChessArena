Best move:\nThe most prudent move appears to be e1f2, moving the king towards the action and potentially supporting the rooks in the future. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. h3h4 is tempting but doesn't improve piece activity. b2b3 is a slow move. a2a3 is a slow move. d7b8 is a slow move. \n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne1f2\n```", "success": true, "final_uci": "e1f2", "top_moves": ["a4c6", "f8b8", "f8f4"], "legal_moves": ["f8h8", "f8g8", "f8e8", "f8d8", "f8c8", "f8b8", "f8a8", "f8f7", "f8f6", "f8f5", "f8f4", "f8f3", "f8f2", "f8f1", "d7b8", "d7f6", "d7b6", "d7e5", "d7c5", "a4c6", "a4b5", "a4b3", "a4c2", "a4d1", "h1g1", "h1f1", "e1f2", "e1e2", "e1d2", "e1f1", "e1d1", "h3h4", "b2b3", "a2a3", "b2b4"], "system": "\nYou are an expert chess player.
