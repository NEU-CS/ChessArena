You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
We only have the move history of you and your opponent. You must reconstruct the game and choose a best move from the legal moves.

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:

If the opponent's last move is "None," it means this is the very first move of the game, and we are playing as White. As White, we have the first move, and it is critical to establish control over the center of the board while developing our pieces efficiently.

The most common and strong opening moves for White are 1. e4 (King's Pawn Opening) and 1. d4 (Queen's Pawn Opening). Both moves aim to control the center and open lines for piece development. 

1. e4 is particularly aggressive, immediately controlling the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop. It is one of the most popular and successful first moves in chess history.

2025-06-17 11:30:44,218 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 4.50s):
Given the opponent's move g1f3 (which is developing the knight to f3 after the previous e2e4), it is a continuation of their development aiming to control the center and prepare for further piece movement. As Black, a natural and common response is to develop your own pieces while maintaining control over the center.

A typical and solid response to Nf3 (after e2e4 and you playing e7e5) is to move your king's bishop to b4, pinning the opponent's knight to the queen and putting some pressure on White's position.

So, my recommended move is:
```

2025-06-17 11:30:51,895 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 7.68s):
Apologies for the confusion earlier. Given the opponent's move g1f3 (developing their knight to f3), and considering the previous moves (e2e4 from White and e7e5 from Black), a natural and typical response for Black would be to develop their own pieces. 

In this context, moving the king's bishop to b4 (d7d5 followed by c8b7 or directly if it's the opening setup considered, but more traditionally and pressure-applying is to move the bishop to b4 immediately after White's Nf3 if pawn to d5 hasn't been played yet) can pin the knight and create some tension in White's position. However, if we're strictly following the sequence and assuming no intermediate moves were missed in our conversation, the move d7d5 (developing the center pawn) would be a solid, standard, and legal response that prepares for further development and doesn't commit to premature openings that might leave weaknesses. 

Therefore, the recommended move following the given sequence and in proper UCI notation is:
```
d7d5

The opponent has played 2...d5, an aggressive move challenging the center and offering a pawn trade. This move is known as the Elephant Gambit, a rare and ambitious opening choice. Black sacrifices a pawn to accelerate development and create counterplay.

As White, we should carefully evaluate whether to accept the gambit or decline it. Accepting the gambit with 3. exd5 gives us a material advantage but allows Black to develop quickly. Declining the gambit with moves like 3. Nc3 or 3. d3 maintains central control and avoids giving Black immediate activity.

After thorough analysis, accepting the gambit with 3. exd5 is the best move. It gives us a pawn advantage, and we can neutralize Black's counterplay with precise moves.

Given this, my recommended move is:
```
e7e5
```
2025-06-17 11:32:02,114 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is g1f3.


2025-06-17 11:32:02,114 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's move g1f3 (which is developing the knight to f3 after the previous e2e4), it is a continuation of their development aiming to control the center and prepare for further piece movement. As Black, a natural and common response is to develop your own pieces while maintaining control over the center.

A typical and solid response to Nf3 (after e2e4 and you playing e7e5) is to move your king's bishop to b4, pinning the opponent's knight to the queen and putting some pressure on White's position.

So, my recommended move is:

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Given the opponent's move g1f3 (developing their knight to f3), and considering the previous moves (e2e4 from White and e7e5 from Black), a natural and typical response for Black would be to develop their own pieces. 

In this context, moving the king's bishop to b4 (d7d5 followed by c8b7 or directly if it's the opening setup considered, but more traditionally and pressure-applying is to move the bishop to b4 immediately after White's Nf3 if pawn to d5 hasn't been played yet) can pin the knight and create some tension in White's position. However, if we're strictly following the sequence and assuming no intermediate moves were missed in our conversation, the move d7d5 (developing the center pawn) would be a solid, standard, and legal response that prepares for further development and doesn't commit to premature openings that might leave weaknesses. 

Therefore, the recommended move following the given sequence and in proper UCI notation is:
```
d7d5
```
2025-06-17 11:32:02,114 - INFO -

2025-06-17 11:32:02,114 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-17 11:32:07,257 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 5.14s):
Given the opponent's last move e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5 with their pawn from e4), it implies that the previous pawn structure allowed for such a capture. This typically happens after moves like e2e4, e7e5, and then g1f3 followed by d7d5 (your last move) and now e4d5 from White. 

At this point, it's crucial to develop your pieces and control the center. A natural response would be to move your knight to c6, developing a piece and preparing for potential exchanges or attacks in the center.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
b8c6

The opponent's last move is None.


2025-06-17 11:32:33,943 - INFO - 
If the opponent's last move is "None," it means this is the very first move of the game, and we are playing as White. As White, we have the first move, and it is critical to establish control over the center of the board while developing our pieces efficiently.

The most common and strong opening moves for White are 1. e4 (King's Pawn Opening) and 1. d4 (Queen's Pawn Opening). Both moves aim to control the center and open lines for piece development. 

1. e4 is particularly aggressive, immediately controlling the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop. It is one of the most popular and successful first moves in chess history.

As White, we should continue developing our pieces while maintaining control of the center. A strong and natural move here is 2. Nf3, attacking the e5 pawn and preparing to castle kingside. This move develops a piece, attacks a central pawn, and follows opening principles.

After careful analysis, I will play:

Declining the gambit with moves like 3. Nc3 or 3. d3 maintains central control and avoids giving Black immediate activity.

2. **d2d4**: Reinforcing the center and protecting the d5 pawn. This move solidifies our control of the center and prepares for further development.
3. **Nb1c3**: Developing the knight to attack the e5 pawn and support the d5 pawn. This move also increases pressure on Black's position.
4. **d5e6**: Advancing the pawn to attack Black's f7 pawn and disrupt their position. This move creates complications but may leave the pawn vulnerable.

A strong response would be to move your pawn to c5, attacking their pawn at d4 and also preparing to develop your bishop, knight, or queen along the c8-h3 diagonal or c-file later. This move also starts to assert control in the center and poses a threat to White's pawn at d4.

After White's pawn advances to d4, attacking your pawn at e5, you have multiple options, but a natural development and center-controlling move would be bringing out your knight.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
We only have the move history of you and your opponent. You must reconstruct the game and choose a best move from the legal moves.

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-17 11:34:06,158 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is e2e4.


2025-06-17 11:34:06,158 - INFO - 
The game has just started, and your opponent's move e2e4 (King's Pawn Opening) is a common and standard opening move. As Black, you have several options to respond. The most popular and solid response is to move your king's pawn forward to e7 to control the center and develop your pieces harmoniously.

Given this, my recommended move is:
```
e7e5
```
2025-06-17 11:34:06,158 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is g1f3.


2025-06-17 11:34:06,158 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's move g1f3 (which is developing the knight to f3 after the previous e2e4), it is a continuation of their development aiming to control the center and prepare for further piece movement. As Black, a natural and common response is to develop your own pieces while maintaining control over the center.

A typical and solid response to Nf3 (after e2e4 and you playing e7e5) is to move your king's bishop to b4, pinning the opponent's knight to the queen and putting some pressure on White's position.

So, my recommended move is:
```
f8c5

2025-06-17 11:34:06,159 - INFO - 
Apologies for the confusion earlier. Given the opponent's move g1f3 (developing their knight to f3), and considering the previous moves (e2e4 from White and e7e5 from Black), a natural and typical response for Black would be to develop their own pieces. 

In this context, moving the king's bishop to b4 (d7d5 followed by c8b7 or directly if it's the opening setup considered, but more traditionally and pressure-applying is to move the bishop to b4 immediately after White's Nf3 if pawn to d5 hasn't been played yet) can pin the knight and create some tension in White's position. However, if we're strictly following the sequence and assuming no intermediate moves were missed in our conversation, the move d7d5 (developing the center pawn) would be a solid, standard, and legal response that prepares for further development and doesn't commit to premature openings that might leave weaknesses. 

Therefore, the recommended move following the given sequence and in proper UCI notation is:
```
d7d5
```
2025-06-17 11:34:06,159 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is e4d5.


2025-06-17 11:34:06,159 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's last move e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5 with their pawn from e4), it implies that the previous pawn structure allowed for such a capture. This typically happens after moves like e2e4, e7e5, and then g1f3 followed by d7d5 (your last move) and now e4d5 from White. 

At this point, it's crucial to develop your pieces and control the center. A natural response would be to move your knight to c6, developing a piece and preparing for potential exchanges or attacks in the center.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
b8c6
```
2025-06-17 11:34:06,159 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is d2d4.


2025-06-17 11:34:06,159 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's last move, d2d4 (pushing the pawn to d4), it aims to control the center and potentially open lines for their bishops or queen. You need to respond with a move that maintains control over the center, develops your pieces, and doesn't leave any weaknesses.

A strong response would be to move your pawn to c5, attacking their pawn at d4 and also preparing to develop your bishop, knight, or queen along the c8-h3 diagonal or c-file later. This move also starts to assert control in the center and poses a threat to White's pawn at d4.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
c7c5
```
2025-06-17 11:34:06,159 - INFO - 
Illegal move: c7c5 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.
2025-06-17 11:34:06,159 - INFO - 
Apologies for the oversight. Given the sequence of moves: e2e4, e7e5, g1f3, d7d5, e4d5, d2d4, and now considering the last move d2d4 legally on the board, I need to reconsider the position carefully.

After White's pawn advances to d4, attacking your pawn at e5, you have multiple options, but a natural development and center-controlling move would be bringing out your knight. A good move would be to develop your knight to f6, which helps control the center and prepares for potential attacks on White's pieces.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
g8f6
```
2025-06-17 11:34:06,159 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is b1c3.


2025-06-17 11:34:06,159 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-17 11:34:15,586 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 9.43s):
Given the opponent's move b1c3 (developing their knight to c3), this move aims to support the pawn at d4 and potentially attack your pieces or pawn structure in the center. You need to respond with a move that continues to develop your pieces, controls the center, and doesn't leave any immediate weaknesses.

A solid response would be to castle kingside, which safeguards your king and develops your rook. This move is also consistent with maintaining control over the center and preparing your pieces for further action.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
g8f6 (previous move you suggested as a good response to White's d2d4, but assuming it's the next turn now after White's b1c3, and if you haven't castled yet, then the immediate response considering development and safety would be)
e8g8 (castling kingside)
```
However, if we're strictly following the sequence and considering that you might have already moved your knight to f6 in response to their d2d4 (and assuming no illegal moves in between were executed in our imagined scenario), the move e8g8 (castling kingside) would still be a valid and strong response to maintain king safety and develop your position. 

But if we're to pick a new move assuming no castling has occurred yet and it's now your turn after b1c3, then:
```
e8g8
```
2025-06-17 11:34:15,586 - WARNING - Illegal move: e8g8 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.
2025-06-17 11:34:15,586 - INFO - Attempt 2/5...
2025-06-17 11:34:22,725 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 7.14s):
Apologies for the mistake. Let's carefully reconstruct the position based on the given moves: White's e2e4, e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5), d2d4, and b1c3 (developing the knight to c3), and your moves e7e5, d7d5, and the intended move after d2d4 was g8f6 (developing the knight). 

Now, considering White's last move b1c3, and assuming you haven't moved other pieces except those stated, it's your turn. A logical move would be to develop your bishop or another piece while keeping control of the center. 

Given this context, and without castling as an immediate option (assuming you haven't moved your king or rook yet and that would be premature without more pieces developed), a good move would be to develop your bishop to c8, but that's just moving it back which isn't ideal. A better move would be to move your other knight, which has been undeveloped so far. 

A natural response would be to bring out your other knight to b8-c6, preparing to engage in the center or support your pawns. 

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
b8c6
```
2025-06-17 11:34:22,725 - WARNING - Illegal move: b8c6 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.

2025-06-17 11:34:30,476 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 7.75s):
I apologize for the persistent confusion. Let's clarify the board position based on the valid sequence we've been considering:

1. White: e2e4
2. Black: e7e5
3. White: g1f3 (Nf3)
4. Black: d7d5
5. White: e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5)
6. Black: (previously considered) g8f6 (developing the knight)
7. White: d2d4
8. Black: (Now, considering White's move b1c3 - knight to c3 - after your g8f6)

Given this sequence, after White's b1c3, and assuming the pieces are on the board as per this sequence (with your knight now at f6), a good and legal response would be to develop another piece or control the center.

A strong move would be to move your pawn to e6, protecting your pawn at d5 and opening up the diagonal for your bishop at f8. This move also continues the theme of controlling the center.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
e5e6
```
2025-06-17 11:34:30,477 - WARNING - Illegal move: e5e6 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.

2025-06-17 11:34:40,099 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 9.62s):
Apologies for the repeated mistakes. Let's carefully reassess the position based on the sequence of moves:

1. White: e2e4
2. Black: e7e5
3. White: g1f3 (developing the knight to f3)
4. Black: d7d5
5. White: e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5 with their pawn from e4)
6. Black: g8f6 (developing the knight to f6)
7. White: d2d4
8. Black: [Your turn now, after White's b1c3 (developing their knight to c3)]

At this point, given the valid moves and the board state (with your knight at f6 and White's knight at c3), you need a move that develops a piece, maintains control over the center, and doesn't leave any immediate weaknesses.

One suitable move is to develop your bishop to c8-b7, attacking White's knight at c3 and opening a line for your rook on a8. This move is both offensive and defensive, trying to assert pressure on White's position.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
f8b4
```
Wait, no, let me correct that because f8b4 is illegal (moving the bishop the wrong way). The correct move would indeed be to develop your bishop to b7:
```
c8b7

2025-06-17 11:35:02,977 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is None.


2025-06-17 11:35:02,977 - INFO - 
If the opponent's last move is "None," it means this is the very first move of the game, and we are playing as White. As White, we have the first move, and it is critical to establish control over the center of the board while developing our pieces efficiently.

The most common and strong opening moves for White are 1. e4 (King's Pawn Opening) and 1. d4 (Queen's Pawn Opening). Both moves aim to control the center and open lines for piece development. 

1. e4 is particularly aggressive, immediately controlling the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop. It is one of the most popular and successful first moves in chess history.

After careful consideration, I will play:

```
e2e4
```
2025-06-17 11:35:02,977 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is e7e5.


2025-06-17 11:35:02,977 - INFO - 
The opponent has responded symmetrically with 1...e5, which is one of the most classical and solid replies to 1. e4. This move contests the center and opens lines for Black's pieces, particularly the queen and the light-squared bishop.

As White, we should continue developing our pieces while maintaining control of the center. A strong and natural move here is 2. Nf3, attacking the e5 pawn and preparing to castle kingside. This move develops a piece, attacks a central pawn, and follows opening principles.

After careful analysis, I will play:

```
g1f3
```
2025-06-17 11:35:02,977 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is d7d5.


2025-06-17 11:35:02,977 - INFO - 
The opponent has played 2...d5, an aggressive move challenging the center and offering a pawn trade. This move is known as the Elephant Gambit, a rare and ambitious opening choice. Black sacrifices a pawn to accelerate development and create counterplay.

As White, we should carefully evaluate whether to accept the gambit or decline it. Accepting the gambit with 3. exd5 gives us a material advantage but allows Black to develop quickly. Declining the gambit with moves like 3. Nc3 or 3. d3 maintains central control and avoids giving Black immediate activity.

After thorough analysis, accepting the gambit with 3. exd5 is the best move. It gives us a pawn advantage, and we can neutralize Black's counterplay with precise moves.

```
e4d5

2025-06-17 11:35:02,977 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is b8c6.


2025-06-17 11:35:02,977 - INFO - 
The opponent has played 3...Nc6, developing a knight and attacking the d5 pawn. Black is aiming to regain the sacrificed pawn while continuing to develop pieces actively. As White, we must carefully defend our position and maintain our advantage.

We have several candidate moves to consider:
1. **d5xc6**: Capturing the knight immediately. This gives Black doubled pawns on the c-file but also allows Black to recapture with the b-pawn, opening the b-file for their rook.
2. **d2d4**: Reinforcing the center and protecting the d5 pawn. This move solidifies our control of the center and prepares for further development.
3. **Nb1c3**: Developing the knight to attack the e5 pawn and support the d5 pawn. This move also increases pressure on Black's position.
4. **d5e6**: Advancing the pawn to attack Black's f7 pawn and disrupt their position. This move creates complications but may leave the pawn vulnerable.

After careful analysis, the best move is **d2d4**, as it reinforces the center, protects the d5 pawn, and prepares for smooth development of our pieces.

2025-06-17 11:35:02,977 - INFO - 
The opponent has played 4...Nf6, developing another knight and attacking the e4 pawn. Black is continuing to develop actively and putting pressure on our center. As White, we must maintain our central control while continuing to develop our pieces harmoniously.

We have several candidate moves to consider:
1. **d4e5**: Advancing the d-pawn to attack the knight on f6. This move gains space and forces Black to respond, but it may leave the pawn vulnerable to counterattacks.
2. **Nb1c3**: Developing the knight to support the center and attack the e5 pawn. This move also increases pressure on Black's position and prepares for kingside development.
3. **Bf1b5**: Developing the bishop to pin the knight on c6 to the king. This move creates tactical pressure and prepares for kingside castling.
4. **d5xc6**: Capturing the knight on c6, doubling Black's pawns on the c-file. This move weakens Black's pawn structure but gives up central control.

After careful analysis, the best move is **Nb1c3**, as it develops a piece, supports the center, and increases pressure on Black's position.

```

2025-06-17 11:35:02,978 - INFO -

2025-06-17 11:35:02,978 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-17 11:35:08,800 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4o) (took 5.82s):
The opponent has played 5...Bb4, pinning our knight on c3 to the king. This is a common and logical move, as it increases pressure on our center, particularly the d4 pawn, and creates tactical threats. We must respond carefully to maintain our central control and avoid losing material.

### Candidate Moves:
1. **d4xe5**: Capturing the pawn on e5, attacking the knight on f6. This gains space and material but leaves our c3 knight pinned, which could lead to tactical issues.
2. **a2a3**: Attacking the bishop on b4 and forcing it to decide whether to capture on c3 or retreat. If the bishop captures, we can recapture with the b-pawn, strengthening our center.
3. **Bf1d3**: Developing the bishop to defend the e4 pawn and prepare for kingside castling. This move also supports the center and prepares for future attacks.
4. **d5xc6**: Capturing the knight on c6, doubling Black's pawns on the c-file. This weakens Black's pawn structure but gives up central control.
5. **e4e5**: Advancing the pawn to attack the knight on f6. This gains space and forces Black to respond, but it leaves the d4 pawn vulnerable.

### Analysis:
- **a2a3** is a strong move because it directly challenges the bishop on b4 and forces Black to make a decision. If Black captures on c3, we can recapture with the b-pawn, strengthening our center and opening the b-file for potential rook activity. If the bishop retreats, we gain time for development.
- **d4xe5** is tempting but leaves our knight pinned, which could lead to tactical problems.
- **Bf1d3** is solid but somewhat passive compared to the more forcing a2a3.
- **e4e5** gains space but weakens the d4 pawn.

After careful consideration, the best move is **a2a3**, as it directly addresses the pin and forces Black to make a decision.

As Black, a natural and common response is to develop your own pieces while maintaining control over the center.

A typical and solid response to Nf3 (after e2e4 and you playing e7e5) is to move your king's bishop to b4, pinning the opponent's knight to the queen and putting some pressure on White's position.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Given the opponent's move g1f3 (developing their knight to f3), and considering the previous moves (e2e4 from White and e7e5 from Black), a natural and typical response for Black would be to develop their own pieces. 

In this context, moving the king's bishop to b4 (d7d5 followed by c8b7 or directly if it's the opening setup considered, but more traditionally and pressure-applying is to move the bishop to b4 immediately after White's Nf3 if pawn to d5 hasn't been played yet) can pin the knight and create some tension in White's position. However, if we're strictly following the sequence and assuming no intermediate moves were missed in our conversation, the move d7d5 (developing the center pawn) would be a solid, standard, and legal response that prepares for further development and doesn't commit to premature openings that might leave weaknesses. 

Therefore, the recommended move following the given sequence and in proper UCI notation is:
```
d7d5
```
2025-06-17 11:35:36,401 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is e4d5.


2025-06-17 11:35:36,401 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's last move e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5 with their pawn from e4), it implies that the previous pawn structure allowed for such a capture. This typically happens after moves like e2e4, e7e5, and then g1f3 followed by d7d5 (your last move) and now e4d5 from White. 

At this point, it's crucial to develop your pieces and control the center. A natural response would be to move your knight to c6, developing a piece and preparing for potential exchanges or attacks in the center.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
b8c6
```
2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is d2d4.


2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's last move, d2d4 (pushing the pawn to d4), it aims to control the center and potentially open lines for their bishops or queen. You need to respond with a move that maintains control over the center, develops your pieces, and doesn't leave any weaknesses.

A strong response would be to move your pawn to c5, attacking their pawn at d4 and also preparing to develop your bishop, knight, or queen along the c8-h3 diagonal or c-file later. This move also starts to assert control in the center and poses a threat to White's pawn at d4.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
c7c5
```
2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 
Illegal move: c7c5 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.

Apologies for the oversight. Given the sequence of moves: e2e4, e7e5, g1f3, d7d5, e4d5, d2d4, and now considering the last move d2d4 legally on the board, I need to reconsider the position carefully.

After White's pawn advances to d4, attacking your pawn at e5, you have multiple options, but a natural development and center-controlling move would be bringing out your knight. A good move would be to develop your knight to f6, which helps control the center and prepares for potential attacks on White's pieces.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
g8f6
```
2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is b1c3.


2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's move b1c3 (developing their knight to c3), this move aims to support the pawn at d4 and potentially attack your pieces or pawn structure in the center. You need to respond with a move that continues to develop your pieces, controls the center, and doesn't leave any immediate weaknesses.

A solid response would be to castle kingside, which safeguards your king and develops your rook. This move is also consistent with maintaining control over the center and preparing your pieces for further action.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
g8f6 (previous move you suggested as a good response to White's d2d4, but assuming it's the next turn now after White's b1c3, and if you haven't castled yet, then the immediate response considering development and safety would be)
e8g8 (castling kingside)
```
However, if we're strictly following the sequence and considering that you might have already moved your knight to f6 in response to their d2d4 (and assuming no illegal moves in between were executed in our imagined scenario), the move e8g8 (castling kingside) would still be a valid and strong response to maintain king safety and develop your position. 

But if we're to pick a new move assuming no castling has occurred yet and it's now your turn after b1c3, then:
```
e8g8
```
2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 
Illegal move: e8g8 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.
2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 
Apologies for the mistake. Let's carefully reconstruct the position based on the given moves: White's e2e4, e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5), d2d4, and b1c3 (developing the knight to c3), and your moves e7e5, d7d5, and the intended move after d2d4 was g8f6 (developing the knight). 

Now, considering White's last move b1c3, and assuming you haven't moved other pieces except those stated, it's your turn. A logical move would be to develop your bishop or another piece while keeping control of the center. 

Given this context, and without castling as an immediate option (assuming you haven't moved your king or rook yet and that would be premature without more pieces developed), a good move would be to develop your bishop to c8, but that's just moving it back which isn't ideal. A better move would be to move your other knight, which has been undeveloped so far. 

A natural response would be to bring out your other knight to b8-c6, preparing to engage in the center or support your pawns. 

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
b8c6
```
2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 
Illegal move: b8c6 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.
2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 
I apologize for the persistent confusion. Let's clarify the board position based on the valid sequence we've been considering:

1. White: e2e4
2. Black: e7e5
3. White: g1f3 (Nf3)
4. Black: d7d5
5. White: e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5)
6. Black: (previously considered) g8f6 (developing the knight)
7. White: d2d4
8. Black: (Now, considering White's move b1c3 - knight to c3 - after your g8f6)

Given this sequence, after White's b1c3, and assuming the pieces are on the board as per this sequence (with your knight now at f6), a good and legal response would be to develop another piece or control the center.

A strong move would be to move your pawn to e6, protecting your pawn at d5 and opening up the diagonal for your bishop at f8. This move also continues the theme of controlling the center.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
e5e6
```
2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 
Illegal move: e5e6 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.
2025-06-17 11:35:36,402 - INFO - 
Apologies for the repeated mistakes. Let's carefully reassess the position based on the sequence of moves:

1. White: e2e4
2. Black: e7e5
3. White: g1f3 (developing the knight to f3)
4. Black: d7d5
5. White: e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5 with their pawn from e4)
6. Black: g8f6 (developing the knight to f6)
7. White: d2d4
8. Black: [Your turn now, after White's b1c3 (developing their knight to c3)]

At this point, given the valid moves and the board state (with your knight at f6 and White's knight at c3), you need a move that develops a piece, maintains control over the center, and doesn't leave any immediate weaknesses.

One suitable move is to develop your bishop to c8-b7, attacking White's knight at c3 and opening a line for your rook on a8. This move is both offensive and defensive, trying to assert pressure on White's position.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
f8b4
```
Wait, no, let me correct that because f8b4 is illegal (moving the bishop the wrong way). The correct move would indeed be to develop your bishop to b7:
```
c8b7
```

2025-06-17 11:35:43,750 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 7.35s):
Given the opponent's move a2a3 (a pawn move that doesn't significantly change the center but prepares to develop pieces), and considering the previous sequence of moves:

1. White: e2e4
2. Black: e7e5
3. White: g1f3
4. Black: d7d5
5. White: e4d5
6. Black: g8f6
7. White: b1c3
8. Black: c8b7 (developing the bishop to b7, as previously recommended)
9. White: a2a3

At this point, you need to continue developing your pieces and maintaining control over the center. One logical move would be to castle kingside if you haven't done so already, which would safeguard your king and develop your rook.

Since castling kingside hasn't been mentioned as previously done, and it would be a valid move at this stage of the game, the recommended move in UCI notation is:

The opponent's last move is None.


2025-06-17 11:36:08,540 - INFO - 
If the opponent's last move is "None," it means this is the very first move of the game, and we are playing as White. As White, we have the first move, and it is critical to establish control over the center of the board while developing our pieces efficiently.

The most common and strong opening moves for White are 1. e4 (King's Pawn Opening) and 1. d4 (Queen's Pawn Opening). Both moves aim to control the center and open lines for piece development. 

1. e4 is particularly aggressive, immediately controlling the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop. It is one of the most popular and successful first moves in chess history.

After careful consideration, I will play:

```
e2e4
```
2025-06-17 11:36:08,541 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is e7e5.


2025-06-17 11:36:08,541 - INFO - 
The opponent has responded symmetrically with 1...e5, which is one of the most classical and solid replies to 1. e4. This move contests the center and opens lines for Black's pieces, particularly the queen and the light-squared bishop.

As White, we should continue developing our pieces while maintaining control of the center. A strong and natural move here is 2. Nf3, attacking the e5 pawn and preparing to castle kingside. This move develops a piece, attacks a central pawn, and follows opening principles.

After careful analysis, I will play:

```
g1f3

2025-06-17 11:36:08,541 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is d7d5.


2025-06-17 11:36:08,541 - INFO - 
The opponent has played 2...d5, an aggressive move challenging the center and offering a pawn trade. This move is known as the Elephant Gambit, a rare and ambitious opening choice. Black sacrifices a pawn to accelerate development and create counterplay.

As White, we should carefully evaluate whether to accept the gambit or decline it. Accepting the gambit with 3. exd5 gives us a material advantage but allows Black to develop quickly. Declining the gambit with moves like 3. Nc3 or 3. d3 maintains central control and avoids giving Black immediate activity.

After thorough analysis, accepting the gambit with 3. exd5 is the best move. It gives us a pawn advantage, and we can neutralize Black's counterplay with precise moves.

The opponent's last move is b8c6.


2025-06-17 11:36:08,541 - INFO - 
The opponent has played 3...Nc6, developing a knight and attacking the d5 pawn. Black is aiming to regain the sacrificed pawn while continuing to develop pieces actively. As White, we must carefully defend our position and maintain our advantage.

We have several candidate moves to consider:
1. **d5xc6**: Capturing the knight immediately. This gives Black doubled pawns on the c-file but also allows Black to recapture with the b-pawn, opening the b-file for their rook.
2. **d2d4**: Reinforcing the center and protecting the d5 pawn. This move solidifies our control of the center and prepares for further development.
3. **Nb1c3**: Developing the knight to attack the e5 pawn and support the d5 pawn. This move also increases pressure on Black's position.
4. **d5e6**: Advancing the pawn to attack Black's f7 pawn and disrupt their position. This move creates complications but may leave the pawn vulnerable.

After careful analysis, the best move is **d2d4**, as it reinforces the center, protects the d5 pawn, and prepares for smooth development of our pieces.

2025-06-17 11:36:08,541 - INFO - 
The opponent has played 4...Nf6, developing another knight and attacking the e4 pawn. Black is continuing to develop actively and putting pressure on our center. As White, we must maintain our central control while continuing to develop our pieces harmoniously.

We have several candidate moves to consider:
1. **d4e5**: Advancing the d-pawn to attack the knight on f6. This move gains space and forces Black to respond, but it may leave the pawn vulnerable to counterattacks.
2. **Nb1c3**: Developing the knight to support the center and attack the e5 pawn. This move also increases pressure on Black's position and prepares for kingside development.
3. **Bf1b5**: Developing the bishop to pin the knight on c6 to the king. This move creates tactical pressure and prepares for kingside castling.
4. **d5xc6**: Capturing the knight on c6, doubling Black's pawns on the c-file. This move weakens Black's pawn structure but gives up central control.

After careful analysis, the best move is **Nb1c3**, as it develops a piece, supports the center, and increases pressure on Black's position.

The opponent's last move is f8b4.


2025-06-17 11:36:08,541 - INFO - 
The opponent has played 5...Bb4, pinning our knight on c3 to the king. This is a common and logical move, as it increases pressure on our center, particularly the d4 pawn, and creates tactical threats. We must respond carefully to maintain our central control and avoid losing material.

### Candidate Moves:
1. **d4xe5**: Capturing the pawn on e5, attacking the knight on f6. This gains space and material but leaves our c3 knight pinned, which could lead to tactical issues.
2. **a2a3**: Attacking the bishop on b4 and forcing it to decide whether to capture on c3 or retreat. If the bishop captures, we can recapture with the b-pawn, strengthening our center.
3. **Bf1d3**: Developing the bishop to defend the e4 pawn and prepare for kingside castling. This move also supports the center and prepares for future attacks.
4. **d5xc6**: Capturing the knight on c6, doubling Black's pawns on the c-file. This weakens Black's pawn structure but gives up central control.
5. **e4e5**: Advancing the pawn to attack the knight on f6. This gains space and forces Black to respond, but it leaves the d4 pawn vulnerable.

### Analysis:
- **a2a3** is a strong move because it directly challenges the bishop on b4 and forces Black to make a decision. If Black captures on c3, we can recapture with the b-pawn, strengthening our center and opening the b-file for potential rook activity. If the bishop retreats, we gain time for development.
- **d4xe5** is tempting but leaves our knight pinned, which could lead to tactical problems.
- **Bf1d3** is solid but somewhat passive compared to the more forcing a2a3.
- **e4e5** gains space but weakens the d4 pawn.

After careful consideration, the best move is **a2a3**, as it directly addresses the pin and forces Black to make a decision.

```

2025-06-17 11:36:14,292 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4o) (took 5.75s):
The opponent has played 6...O-O, castling kingside to secure their king and activate the rook on f8. This is a logical move that improves Black's position and prepares for future activity. As White, we should continue developing our pieces while maintaining central control and addressing the pin on our knight.

### Current Position:
- Black's bishop on b4 is still pinning our knight on c3.
- Black's king is now safe on g8, and their rook on f8 is active.
- Our pawn structure and central control are strong, but we need to complete development and address the pin.

### Candidate Moves:
1. **a3b4**: Capturing the bishop on b4. This removes the pin on our knight and forces Black to recapture with the pawn, weakening their pawn structure.
2. **d4xe5**: Capturing the pawn on e5, attacking the knight on f6. This gains material and space but leaves our knight pinned, which could lead to tactical issues.
3. **Bf1d3**: Developing the bishop to defend the e4 pawn and prepare for kingside castling. This move also supports the center and prepares for future attacks.
4. **e4e5**: Advancing the pawn to attack the knight on f6. This gains space and forces Black to respond, but it leaves the d4 pawn vulnerable.

### Analysis:
- **a3b4** is a strong move because it removes the pin on our knight and weakens Black's pawn structure. After Black recaptures with the a-pawn, we can use our knight more freely.
- **d4xe5** is tempting but leaves our knight pinned, which could lead to tactical problems.
- **Bf1d3** is solid and develops a piece, but it doesn't immediately address the pin.
- **e4e5** gains space but weakens the d4 pawn.

After careful consideration, the best move is **a3b4**, as it removes the pin and weakens Black's pawn structure.

A typical and solid response to Nf3 (after e2e4 and you playing e7e5) is to move your king's bishop to b4, pinning the opponent's knight to the queen and putting some pressure on White's position.

2025-06-17 11:36:30,422 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's last move e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5 with their pawn from e4), it implies that the previous pawn structure allowed for such a capture. This typically happens after moves like e2e4, e7e5, and then g1f3 followed by d7d5 (your last move) and now e4d5 from White. 

At this point, it's crucial to develop your pieces and control the center. A natural response would be to move your knight to c6, developing a piece and preparing for potential exchanges or attacks in the center.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
b8c6
```
2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is d2d4.


2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's last move, d2d4 (pushing the pawn to d4), it aims to control the center and potentially open lines for their bishops or queen. You need to respond with a move that maintains control over the center, develops your pieces, and doesn't leave any weaknesses.

A strong response would be to move your pawn to c5, attacking their pawn at d4 and also preparing to develop your bishop, knight, or queen along the c8-h3 diagonal or c-file later. This move also starts to assert control in the center and poses a threat to White's pawn at d4.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
c7c5
```

Illegal move: c7c5 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.
2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 
Apologies for the oversight. Given the sequence of moves: e2e4, e7e5, g1f3, d7d5, e4d5, d2d4, and now considering the last move d2d4 legally on the board, I need to reconsider the position carefully.

After White's pawn advances to d4, attacking your pawn at e5, you have multiple options, but a natural development and center-controlling move would be bringing out your knight. A good move would be to develop your knight to f6, which helps control the center and prepares for potential attacks on White's pieces.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
g8f6
```
2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is b1c3.


2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's move b1c3 (developing their knight to c3), this move aims to support the pawn at d4 and potentially attack your pieces or pawn structure in the center. You need to respond with a move that continues to develop your pieces, controls the center, and doesn't leave any immediate weaknesses.

A solid response would be to castle kingside, which safeguards your king and develops your rook. This move is also consistent with maintaining control over the center and preparing your pieces for further action.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
g8f6 (previous move you suggested as a good response to White's d2d4, but assuming it's the next turn now after White's b1c3, and if you haven't castled yet, then the immediate response considering development and safety would be)
e8g8 (castling kingside)
```
However, if we're strictly following the sequence and considering that you might have already moved your knight to f6 in response to their d2d4 (and assuming no illegal moves in between were executed in our imagined scenario), the move e8g8 (castling kingside) would still be a valid and strong response to maintain king safety and develop your position. 

But if we're to pick a new move assuming no castling has occurred yet and it's now your turn after b1c3, then:
```
e8g8
```

2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 
Apologies for the mistake. Let's carefully reconstruct the position based on the given moves: White's e2e4, e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5), d2d4, and b1c3 (developing the knight to c3), and your moves e7e5, d7d5, and the intended move after d2d4 was g8f6 (developing the knight). 

Now, considering White's last move b1c3, and assuming you haven't moved other pieces except those stated, it's your turn. A logical move would be to develop your bishop or another piece while keeping control of the center. 

Given this context, and without castling as an immediate option (assuming you haven't moved your king or rook yet and that would be premature without more pieces developed), a good move would be to develop your bishop to c8, but that's just moving it back which isn't ideal. A better move would be to move your other knight, which has been undeveloped so far. 

A natural response would be to bring out your other knight to b8-c6, preparing to engage in the center or support your pawns. 

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
b8c6
```

I apologize for the persistent confusion. Let's clarify the board position based on the valid sequence we've been considering:

1. White: e2e4
2. Black: e7e5
3. White: g1f3 (Nf3)
4. Black: d7d5
5. White: e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5)
6. Black: (previously considered) g8f6 (developing the knight)
7. White: d2d4
8. Black: (Now, considering White's move b1c3 - knight to c3 - after your g8f6)

Given this sequence, after White's b1c3, and assuming the pieces are on the board as per this sequence (with your knight now at f6), a good and legal response would be to develop another piece or control the center.

A strong move would be to move your pawn to e6, protecting your pawn at d5 and opening up the diagonal for your bishop at f8. This move also continues the theme of controlling the center.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
e5e6
```
2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 
Illegal move: e5e6 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one.
2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 
Apologies for the repeated mistakes. Let's carefully reassess the position based on the sequence of moves:

1. White: e2e4
2. Black: e7e5
3. White: g1f3 (developing the knight to f3)
4. Black: d7d5
5. White: e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5 with their pawn from e4)
6. Black: g8f6 (developing the knight to f6)
7. White: d2d4
8. Black: [Your turn now, after White's b1c3 (developing their knight to c3)]

At this point, given the valid moves and the board state (with your knight at f6 and White's knight at c3), you need a move that develops a piece, maintains control over the center, and doesn't leave any immediate weaknesses.

One suitable move is to develop your bishop to c8-b7, attacking White's knight at c3 and opening a line for your rook on a8. This move is both offensive and defensive, trying to assert pressure on White's position.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
f8b4
```
Wait, no, let me correct that because f8b4 is illegal (moving the bishop the wrong way). The correct move would indeed be to develop your bishop to b7:
```
c8b7
```
2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is a2a3.


2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 
Given the opponent's move a2a3 (a pawn move that doesn't significantly change the center but prepares to develop pieces), and considering the previous sequence of moves:

1. White: e2e4
2. Black: e7e5
3. White: g1f3
4. Black: d7d5
5. White: e4d5
6. Black: g8f6
7. White: b1c3
8. Black: c8b7 (developing the bishop to b7, as previously recommended)
9. White: a2a3

At this point, you need to continue developing your pieces and maintaining control over the center. One logical move would be to castle kingside if you haven't done so already, which would safeguard your king and develop your rook.

Since castling kingside hasn't been mentioned as previously done, and it would be a valid move at this stage of the game, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
e8g8
```
2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - 

The opponent's last move is a3b4.


2025-06-17 11:36:30,423 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-17 11:36:39,495 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 9.07s):
Given the opponent's move a3b4 (capturing your bishop at b7 with their pawn from a3), this indicates that your previous move was c8b7, which they've now captured. 

With the bishop at b7 gone, and considering the sequence up to now, you need to respond in a way that continues development, controls the center, and prepares for potential attacks or exchanges.

A suitable move would be to develop your remaining bishop by moving it to d6, which controls the center and provides options for further piece movement.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
f8b4 (Wait, no, that's incorrect as it's moving a pawn back which is not a development. Correcting...)
c8b4 (is the capture that already happened, so not an option now. The correct development move is)
f1c4 (developing the bishop to c4, but that's not a valid move as your bishop isn't there yet. The correct move would be to continue development)
Actually, given the current board state and considering your pieces, a good move would be to develop your queen slightly by moving it to d7, but that too depends on the exact position. The simplest and most logical development move left is to bring your queen's pawn one step forward to control more center squares and prepare for further development:
```
d7d6
```
This move advances a pawn, controls the center, and prepares to support further piece development.

4. Black: d7d5
5. White: e4d5
6. Black: g8f6
7. White: b1c3
8. Black: c8b7
9. White: a3b4 (capturing the bishop)

Now, it's your turn, and you need to respond with a move that continues development, maintains control over the center, or prepares for future actions.

Given the current board state, one viable move would be to develop your other knight. A good move would be to move your knight from b8 to c6, which would help control the center and also provide support for potential attacks or defenses.

Thus, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
b8c6

2025-06-17 11:37:02,401 - INFO - Raw response from Black (api_9) (took 16.35s):
I apologize for the recurring errors. Let me reassess the board position based on the moves clearly played:

1. White: e2e4  
2. Black: e7e5  
3. White: g1f3  
4. Black: d7d5  
5. White: e4d5 (capturing your pawn with their pawn from e4)  
6. Black: g8f6 (developing your knight to f6)  
7. White: b1c3 (developing their knight to c3)  
8. Black: c8b7 (developing your bishop to b7)  
9. White: a3b4 (capturing your bishop at b7)  

Now, considering the current board state where your bishop at b7 has been captured, you should look to continue developing your pieces and maintaining control over the center.

One possible move is to play d5c4, capturing White's pawn at c4 with your pawn (assuming they've pushed their pawn there, though it wasn't explicitly mentioned, it's a logical next step in the sequence). However, since this captures an unmentioned pawn, another viable and safe move is to develop your queen's bishop by bringing it out to g7 or another square based on the need, but since we're focusing on standard and logical openings, and considering the possibility that your d5 pawn might still be there, I'll suggest moving your other knight to a6 to prepare for future actions or to support your center pawns indirectly.

But given the immediate need to respond to what's happened so far and not assuming unstated moves, a simple development move would be to castle kingside if the king and rook haven't moved yet, which is a standard response to maintain safety and develop your rook.

Assuming castling is still an option, the move would be:
```
e8g8
```
If castling kingside isn't possible (perhaps due to an unmentioned rook or king move), another development move would be to prepare for actions in the center or on the kingside by playing a pawn move like e6 to support your center and control more squares.

Thus, another candidate move, if castling isn't an option, is:
```
e5e6
```
Given the uncertainty over whether castling is legal, and assuming standard play where it might not have been done yet, the recommended move would be to castle kingside:
```
e8g8
```

I apologize for the oversight. Let's carefully consider the moves played and the current board position:

1. White: e2e4  
2. Black: e7e5  
3. White: g1f3  
4. Black: d7d5  
5. White: e4d5 (capturing your pawn at d5)

7. White: b1c3 (developing their knight to c3)  
8. Black: c8b7 (developing your bishop to b7, which was then captured by White's pawn at a3b4)  

Given this sequence, and assuming that no further moves have been made, you need to develop a piece, control the center, or address any immediate threats.

A good move would be to continue development by bringing out your queen's bishop. One suitable move is to play your bishop from f8 to g7, developing the piece and preparing for future actions in the center or on the kingside.

Therefore, the recommended move in UCI notation is:
```
f8g7

1. White: e2e4  
2. Black: e7e5  
3. White: g1f3

At this point, after White's capture at b4, you need a move that continues piece development, maintains control over the center, and prepares for further play.

One valid and development-focused move would be to play your other knight from b8 to a6, which helps control the center indirectly and prepares for future actions, possibly in coordination with your queen or other pieces.
