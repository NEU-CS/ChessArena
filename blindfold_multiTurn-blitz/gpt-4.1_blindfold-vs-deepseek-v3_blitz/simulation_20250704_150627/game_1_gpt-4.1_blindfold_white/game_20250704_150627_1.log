You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
We only have the move history of you and your opponent. You must reconstruct the game and choose a best move from the legal moves.

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-07-04 15:06:45,094 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blindfold) (took 2.75s):
Let's consider the best opening move for White. The two most popular and theoretically sound opening moves are 1.e4 and 1.d4. Both control the center and open lines for the queen and bishop.

1.e4 is the most aggressive and leads to open games, while 1.d4 often leads to more strategic, closed positions.

Given the need for urgency and to press for an advantage, 1.e4 is often considered the best move for White, maximizing central control and piece activity.

Therefore, my move is:
```
e2e4
```

2025-07-04 15:07:18,395 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3_blitz) (took 14.08s):
Let me analyze this position carefully. This is the starting position after White has played e2-e4 (King's Pawn Opening). As Black, I need to choose a solid response that develops my pieces and controls the center.
Key considerations:
1. The e4 pawn is a central target - I can challenge it immediately with e7-e5 or d7-d5
2. Developing knights is also a good option - Nf6 or Nc6 are standard developing moves
3. I should avoid weakening moves like h6/g6/f6 unless necessary
4. I want to maintain flexibility for future development
Top candidate moves:
1. e7e5 - Symmetrical response, directly challenging the center. Leads to open games.
2. g8f6 - Developing the knight to its most active square, attacking e4 indirectly.
3. d7d5 - Immediate counter in the center, leading to Scandinavian-like structures.
4. b8c6 - Developing the knight but less flexible than Nf6.
After careful consideration:
- e5 is very solid but somewhat predictable
- d5 is aggressive but gives White more options
- Nf6 is flexible and maintains options for various defenses (like the Alekhine or Petrov)
- Nc6 is playable but commits to a certain structure
The most flexible and principled move is g8f6 (Nf6), developing a piece while keeping options open for future plans. It doesn't commit the pawn structure yet and puts immediate pressure on e4.
```
g8f6

2025-07-04 15:07:42,396 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blindfold) (took 3.87s):
Let's reconstruct the position:

1. e4 Nf6

This is Alekhine's Defense. Black immediately attacks the e4 pawn, inviting White to advance and chase the knight, often leading to dynamic positions.

**Candidate moves:**
- e4e5: The main line, attacking the knight and gaining space.
- d2d3: Defends e4, but is passive and less ambitious.
- Nc3: Defends e4, but blocks the c-pawn.
- Nf3: Develops a piece, but allows Nxe4.
- d4: Grabs the center, but allows Nxe4.

**Analysis:**
- e5 is the most critical test of Alekhine's Defense. After e5, Black's knight must move, and White gains space.
- d4 is also playable, but after Nxe4, White must be ready to sacrifice a pawn or regain it with tempo.
- Nf3 allows Nxe4, losing a central pawn.

**Best move:**
e5 is the main line and puts immediate pressure on Black.

Therefore, my move is:
```
e4e5
```
