2025-07-04 15:06:55,537 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3_blitz) (took 13.18s):
Let me analyze this starting position carefully. As White, I have several good options to begin the game:
1. **Pawn moves**: The most common and strategically sound are e2-e4 or d2-d4, controlling the center immediately. e4 leads to open games while d4 leads to more closed positions.
2. **Knight moves**: Developing knights with Nf3 or Nc3 is also reasonable, though less committal than pawn moves.
3. **Flank pawn moves**: Like c4 (English) or f4 (Bird's) are playable but less central.
For maximum advantage in a critical match, I should choose the most challenging and theoretically sound move. e2e4 is the most aggressive and ambitious move, opening lines for both bishop and queen while fighting for central control. It leads to the widest variety of possible positions and gives Black the most chances to go wrong.
After e4, Black's main responses are e5 (open game), c5 (Sicilian), e6 (French), or c6 (Carpath), each leading to different types of struggles where White can press for advantage.
```
e2e4

2025-07-04 15:07:18,643 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blindfold) (took 3.61s):
Let's analyze the position:

White has just played e2-e4. This is the first move of the game, so the position is the standard starting position.

As Black, the main responses to 1.e4 are:

1...c5 (Sicilian Defense): Very popular, leads to unbalanced positions and many tactical opportunities.
1...e5 (Open Game): Classical, symmetrical, leads to many well-studied lines.
1...e6 (French Defense): Solid, but can be somewhat passive.
1...c6 (Caro-Kann Defense): Solid, less tactical than Sicilian.
1...d6 (Pirc/Modern): Flexible, but can be passive if not played accurately.
1...d5 (Scandinavian): Direct, but can give White a slight initiative.

Of these, 1...c5 and 1...e5 are the most ambitious and theoretically sound if you want to play for a win.

Given the urgency and the need to play for a win, the Sicilian Defense (1...c5) is a great choice. It avoids symmetry, creates imbalances, and gives Black many chances for counterplay.

Therefore, my move is:
```
c7c5
```
