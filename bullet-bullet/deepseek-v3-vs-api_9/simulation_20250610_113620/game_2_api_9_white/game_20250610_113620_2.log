2025-06-10 12:10:26,720 - INFO - Prompt to Black (deepseek-v3):

You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.

Current board position in FEN notation:
4K2k/2p3p1/8/7p/8/8/P1PP2PP/8 b - - 1 49

Legal moves in UCI notation: h8g8, h8h7, g7g6, c7c6, h5h4, g7g5, c7c5

Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:

```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
Directly give me your answer. You can not think and reason, and your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
