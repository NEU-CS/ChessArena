Okay, let's see. The current position is given in FEN: 8/7k/1pp2K2/p7/8/8/PPP2P1P/8 b - - 3 77. So Black is to move. The legal moves listed are h7h8, h7g8, h7h6, c6c5, b6b5, a5a4. 

First, I need to visualize the board. The FEN notation breaks down as follows: 
- The first part "8" means there are 8 empty squares on the first rank.
- The next part "7k" means there are 7 empty squares on the second rank, followed by a black king on the 8th rank (but wait, the FEN is written from White's perspective, so the board is flipped here. Wait, no. FEN is written from White's perspective, so the first rank is rank 1 for White, which is rank 8 for Black. Wait, the current position is given as 8/7k/1pp2K2/p7/8/8/PPP2P1P/8. Let me parse this correctly.

Wait, the FEN string is written from White's perspective, so the rightmost part is the 8th rank. Let's break it down:

- 8: Rank 8 has all squares empty.
- 7k: Rank 7 has 7 empty squares, then a black king (since it's lowercase 'k') on h7? Wait, no. Wait, the FEN is written as the board from White's perspective, so the first part is rank 8, then rank 7, etc. Wait, no, the FEN is written from the 8th rank down to the 1st. So the first part "8" is rank 8: all empty. Then "7k" is rank 7: 7 empty squares followed by a black king on h7? Wait, but 'k' is lowercase, which is black's king. Wait, but in the FEN, the pieces are written from White's perspective. So if the king is on h7 (rank 7, file h), but since the FEN is given as 8/7k/1pp2K2/p7/8/8/PPP2P1P/8, let's parse each part:

- 8: Rank 8: all empty.
- 7k: Rank 7: 7 empty squares, then a black king on h7.
- 1pp2K2: Rank 6: 1 (empty), then two black pawns (pp), then 2 empty, then White's king (K) on f6, then 2 empty. Wait, no. Wait, the FEN for rank 6 is "1pp2K2". Let's see: 1 (1 empty), then pp (two black pawns), then 2 (two empty), then K (White's king on f6), then 2 (two empty). So the White king is on f6? Wait, but that seems odd because the current player is Black. Wait, the FEN string is:

8/7k/1pp2K2/p7/8/8/PPP2P1P/8

So breaking it down:

Rank 8: 8 (all empty)
Rank 7: 7k (7 empty, then black king on h7)
Rank 6: 1pp2K2 (1 empty, then pp, then 2 empty, then K on f6, then 2 empty)
Rank 5: p7 (a pawn on a5, then 7 empty?)
Wait, no. Wait, each part of the FEN represents a rank from 8 down to 1. So the third part after the first two slashes is the sixth rank. Wait, maybe I need to write this out properly.

Let me list the ranks from 8 to 1:

Rank 8: 8 (all empty)
Rank 7: 7k → 7 empty squares, then black king on h7 (file h)
Wait, but '7k' would mean 7 squares, then a 'k' on the 8th file? Wait, no, the FEN numbers represent the count of empty squares. So '7k' would mean 7 empty squares, followed by a black king on the next square (8th file of rank 7). So the black king is on h7 (since rank 7, file h is h7).

Rank 6: 1pp2K2 → 1 empty, then two pawns (pp), then 2 empty, then White's king (K) on f6, then 2 empty. Wait, the 1pp2K2 would break down as: 1 (empty), pp (two pawns), 2 (empty), K (on the 6th file?), wait, no. Wait, the FEN for a rank is read from left to right (from a-file to h-file). So "1pp2K2" would be:

- 1: first square is empty (a6)
- pp: next two squares are black pawns (b6 and c6)
- 2: next two squares empty (d6 and e6)
- K: next square is White's king on f6
- 2: next two squares empty (g6 and h6)

So the White king is on f6. Then rank 5 is p7: a pawn on a5, then 7 empty squares? Wait, "p7" would be a pawn on a5 (since rank 5, starting from a-file: 'p' is on a5, then 7 empty squares. So a5 is a black pawn? Wait, 'p' is lowercase, so black's pawn. So on a5, there's a black pawn. Then the rest of the squares on rank 5 are empty.

Rank 4: 8 (all empty)
Rank 3: 8 (all empty)
Rank 2: PPP2P1P → let's parse this. Wait, the FEN for rank 2 is "PPP2P1P". Wait, but the current board is from the FEN given as 8/7k/1pp2K2/p7/8/8/PPP2P1P/8. Wait, the last part is rank 1: 8 (all empty). So the second rank (rank 2) is "PPP2P1P". Let's parse:

- PPP: three white pawns on a2, b2, c2
- 2: two empty squares (d2 and e2)
- P: white pawn on f2
- 1: empty on g2
- P: white pawn on h2

Wait, but "PPP2P1P" would be:

- PPP: a2, b2, c2 are white pawns
- 2: d2 and e2 empty
- P: f2 is white pawn
- 1: g2 empty
- P: h2 is white pawn

So the white pawns are on a2, b2, c2, f2, h2. 

But wait, the current player is Black, and the position is after move 77, so it's a very endgame position. The black king is on h7, and the white king is on f6. 

Looking at the legal moves for Black: h7h8, h7g8, h7h6, c6c5, b6b5, a5a4. 

Wait, the legal moves are the possible moves for Black. Let's see:

- h7h8: Moving the king from h7 to h8. But h8 is a square on rank 8, which in the FEN is empty. However, the king can move there. But is that safe? Because if the king moves to h8, is there any check? Let's check the position. The white king is on f6. Moving the black king to h8 would put it two squares away, so no check. But perhaps the move is allowed. 

Alternatively, h7g8: moving the king from h7 to g8. But g8 is a square adjacent to h7. However, in the current position, the FEN shows rank 8 is empty, so g8 is empty. So moving the king from h7 to g8 is a valid move. But the king can move one square in any direction. So h7g8 is moving the king from h7 (rank 7, file h) to g8 (rank 8, file g). That's a diagonal move. 

Wait, but in chess notation, moves are written as from and to squares. So h7 to h8 would be moving the king from h7 to h8 (same file, next rank). Similarly, h7g8 is moving the king from h7 to g8 (adjacent file and rank). 

But in the current position, the black king is

2025-06-24 21:44:57,333 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You must give me your answer directly without using any other words. I will not accept your answer if there exists any other words. Only output ```<move>```. 
Your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
