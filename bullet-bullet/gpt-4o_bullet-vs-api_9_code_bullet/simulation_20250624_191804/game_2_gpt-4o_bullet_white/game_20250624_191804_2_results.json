The key features are:\n   - Black's king is on h7, while White's king is on h7 (a typo in the FEN; likely h2 or another square, but assuming h7 for this analysis).\n   - Black has a knight on h3, which is well-placed but vulnerable to exchanges or forced moves.\n   - White has a rook on a1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, and g2, and a bishop on g1 (if the FEN is corrected).\n   - The legal moves suggest Black must choose between promoting (f8e8), moving the knight, or adjusting the pawn structure.\n\n2. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **f8e8 (Promote pawn to queen)**: This is likely the strongest move, as promoting to a queen adds significant attacking power and could quickly overpower White's defenses.\n   - **h3g5 (Knight move)**: This is a defensive retreat but doesn't press the advantage.\n   - **Other knight moves (h3f4, h3f2, h3g1)**: These are less useful and could lead to the knight being trapped.\n   - **Pawn moves (d7d6, b7b6, etc.)**: These are passive and don't exploit White's potential weaknesses.\n\n3. **Best Move**: **f8e8** (promote the pawn to a queen) is the most aggressive and strategic move here. It creates a queen, which can then be used to checkmate or force resignation.\n\n```\nf8e8\n```",

You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.\nWhen you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou must give me your answer directly without using any other words.
