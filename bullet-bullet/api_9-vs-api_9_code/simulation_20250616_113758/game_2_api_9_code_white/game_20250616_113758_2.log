Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
