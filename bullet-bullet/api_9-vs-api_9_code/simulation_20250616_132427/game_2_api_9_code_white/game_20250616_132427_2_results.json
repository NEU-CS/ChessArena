If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou must give me your answer directly without using any other words. I will not accept your answer if there exists any other words. Only output ```<move>```. \nYour final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"
