To address the critical fork by White's queen on c5 (attacking the undefended knight on c6 and pawn on d5), Black must prioritize minimizing material loss. The optimal move is to defend the higher-value knight (3 points) with the bishop, allowing White to capture only the lower-value pawn (1 point) instead of losing the knight. This reduces the immediate material disadvantage and avoids catastrophic exchanges.
