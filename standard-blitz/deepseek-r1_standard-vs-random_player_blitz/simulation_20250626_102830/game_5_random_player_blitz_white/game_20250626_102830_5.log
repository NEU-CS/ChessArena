When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```

When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.

```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4

When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.

```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.

When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4

When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.

```
<move>
```

For example:
```

When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4

When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4

```
<move>
```

For example:
```

```
<move>
```

For example:
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.

When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.

```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
