2025-07-15 19:24:50,881 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 8.53s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.

The current position shows White has played g2-g3, which is unusual and doesn't develop any piece. As Black, I should focus on developing my pieces while maintaining control of the center.

Let me consider some candidate moves:

1. g8f6 - Developing the knight to its most natural square, attacking e4 and preparing for castling.
2. e7e5 - Claiming the center immediately.
3. b8c6 - Developing the other knight.
4. d7d5 - Another central pawn push.

Looking at these options:
- g8f6 develops a piece and puts pressure on e4
- e7e5 claims the center but might lead to early tension
- b8c6 develops a piece but doesn't challenge White's setup
- d7d5 also claims the center but blocks the bishop

The knight development to f6 seems strongest as it develops a piece, controls important squares, and prepares for future castling. This is a standard opening principle - develop knights before bishops and castle soon.

After considering these options, I believe developing the knight to f6 is the best move here.

```

2025-07-15 19:25:41,192 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 10.69s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully:

1. The FEN shows we're playing as Black (the "b" after the first slash).
2. The position is from the opening phase - White has played 1.e4 (d2d4) and 2.Nf3 (g2g3), while Black has responded with 2...Nf6 (f8f6).
3. The legal moves list includes several options for Black, including developing the knight further or making pawn advances.

Key observations:
- White has developed their knight to g3 (which is somewhat unusual)
- Black's knight on f6 is well-placed attacking e4
- The center is still fluid with pawns on d4/d5 not yet fixed
- We should focus on completing development and maintaining central control

Looking at the candidate moves:
- Developing the other knight (b8c6) would be natural
- Pawn pushes like e7e5 could challenge White's center
- Moving the queen's bishop (f8g7) isn't listed but might be considered later
- The most forcing move would be e7e5 immediately challenging the center

After careful consideration, the best move appears to be e7e5 because:
1. It challenges White's center immediately
2. Opens lines for our light-squared bishop
3. Maintains pressure on White's d4 pawn
4. Doesn't prematurely commit our queenside pieces

The move fits well within classical opening principles of controlling the center and developing pieces harmoniously.

2025-07-15 19:26:40,024 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 9.63s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 1.e4 Nf6 2.d4 exd4 3.h4

- White has played h4, which is unusual and gives up space on the kingside.
- Black to move.
- Material is equal.
- White's king is still in the center, but so is Black's.
- The e5 pawn is under attack by the d4 pawn.
- No immediate threats from White.

Candidate Moves:
1. exd4: Recaptures the pawn, opens the e-file, and keeps the center open.
2. Nxe4: Not possible, as the knight is not on f3.
3. Qxd4: Not possible, as the queen is not on d8.
4. Bc5/Bb4: Developing moves, but e5d4 is more pressing.
5. Nc6: Develops a piece, but doesn't address the pawn capture.
6. Other pawn moves: Not urgent.

Analysis:
- The most natural move is to recapture the pawn with the e-pawn: exd4.
- This keeps the center open, develops the bishop to c5 or b4 next, and maintains flexibility.
- There are no immediate tactics for White after exd4.

Conclusion:
The best move is to recapture the pawn with the e-pawn.

2025-07-15 19:28:09,829 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 12.37s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully:

1. The FEN shows we're playing as Black (the "b" in the first part).
2. Key features of the position:
   - White has advanced pawns on h4 and g3, creating some space on kingside
   - Our knight on f6 is well-placed, attacking d5 and controlling key squares
   - The pawn on d4 is under attack from our queen (which hasn't moved yet)
   - White's king is still in the center (not castled)
   - We have several development options available

3. Candidate moves to consider:
   - f6d5: Knight fork threatening both the queen and bishop
   - f6g4: Attacking the h2 rook and putting pressure on white's kingside
   - f8b4+: Check with the bishop, forcing the king to move
   - d8e7: Developing the queen while protecting the d4 pawn

After careful consideration:
- f6d5 looks very strong as it creates immediate threats against both the queen and bishop
- However, after Qxd5, we'd lose material unless we recapture with the queen
- f6g4 attacks the rook but allows White to defend easily with Rh1
- f8b4+ forces the king to move but doesn't create lasting threats
- d8e7 develops the queen safely while maintaining pressure on d4

The most promising move appears to be developing the queen to e7, which:
1. Protects the d4 pawn
2. Develops a piece toward the center
3. Prepares potential future operations along the e-file
4. Maintains flexibility in our position

Therefore, my chosen move is:

```
d8e7
```

2025-07-15 19:29:15,521 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 14.73s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 5. g4:
- White has pushed g4, attacking the knight on f6.
- Black's king is still in the center, but castling rights remain.
- White's rook is on h2, bishop on c1, queen on d1, knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g4, h4.
- Black's pieces: queen on e7, knight on f6, bishop on f8, rooks on a8 and h8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g7, h7.

Immediate threats:
- The knight on f6 is attacked by g4.
- White threatens Nxf6+ if the knight moves.
- Black's development is behind; only the queen and knight are active.
- No immediate tactics for White.

Candidate moves:
1. f6g4: Captures the pawn, but after hxg4, White opens the h-file and keeps pressure.
2. f6h5: Retreats the knight, but loses time and allows White to develop.
3. f6d5: Centralizes the knight, attacks c3 and e4, but doesn't address the threat.
4. e7e6: Defends the knight, but blocks the bishop.
5. e7e5: Attacks the d4 pawn, but White can play Nf3 next.
6. Castling (h8g8): Safe, but passive.
7. d4d3: Pushes the pawn, but White can play exd3, opening lines.

Critical analysis:
- f6g4 is forced if we want to maintain material equality. After f6g4, hxg4, Black can castle queenside or continue developing.
- Other moves lose the knight for free.

Tactical check:
- After f6g4 hxg4, there are no immediate tactics for White.
- Black can then castle queenside and continue development.

Conclusion:
The best move is to capture the pawn with the knight.

My move:
```
f6g4

2025-07-15 19:30:29,626 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 17.87s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.

Current assessment:
- Material is even (both sides have a queen, two rooks, two bishops, knights, and pawns)
- Black has just captured a pawn on d4 with their knight
- The position appears relatively balanced, though White has some space advantage
- Black's king is still in the center which could be dangerous

Let me consider some candidate moves:

1. g4h6 - Retreating the knight to protect against potential threats
2. e7e5 - Developing the queen actively toward the center
3. b8c6 - Developing the knight to a natural square
4. d4d3 - Pushing the passed pawn forward

Looking at g4h6: This retreats the knight but doesn't develop other pieces. It might be defensive but not necessarily the most active choice.

The queen move e7e5 looks interesting as it develops the queen toward the center and puts pressure on White's position. However, I should check if there are any tactical issues with this move.

The knight development b8c6 is solid and helps control central squares.

The pawn push d4d3 creates a passed pawn but might weaken Black's structure.

After careful consideration, developing the knight to c6 seems like the most principled move. It controls central squares, prepares for castling, and maintains flexibility.

```

2025-07-15 19:31:53,119 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 14.56s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 7. Bb3:
- White has developed both knights, bishop to b3, queen to d1, rook to h2, and pawn to h4.
- Black has played...Nd4, attacking the bishop on b3.
- The knight on g4 is pinned to the king by the bishop on h2.
- Black's queen is on e7, and the bishop on c8 is undeveloped.
- White threatens to capture the knight on d4 with the bishop, winning material.
- Black's king is still in the center, and development is lagging.

Immediate threats:
- White can play Bxd4, winning a piece.
- The pin on the g-file could become dangerous if White develops quickly.

Candidate moves:
1. Nxc3: Not possible, as there is no knight on c3.
2. Qxd4: Captures the bishop, but allows Bxe7+ Kxe7, and White wins the exchange.
3. Qe6: Defends the d4 knight, but blocks the bishop and doesn't solve development issues.
4. Qe4: Attacks the bishop, but White can simply retreat to c1 or a3.
5. Qe5: Centralizes the queen, defends d4, and keeps options open.
6. Qe3: Attacks the bishop, but White can retreat to c1 or a3.
7. Qe2: Retreats, not ideal.
8. Qe4: As above.
9. Qe5: Seems most flexible, defending d4 and keeping the queen active.

Tactical considerations:
- After Qe5, if Bxd4, then Qxd4, and Black is fine.
- If White does nothing, Black can continue development.

Strategic considerations:
- Black needs to develop quickly and get the king safe.
- The queen on e5 eyes the kingside and supports future plans.

Conclusion:
The best move is to defend the d4 knight with the queen, centralize her, and keep flexibility.

2025-07-15 19:33:18,114 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 17.41s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 7...Qe5:
- Black to move.
- Material: Equal.
- White has a strong pawn center (d4, e4) and development.
- Black's queen is centralized on e5, eyeing both kingside and queenside.
- White's king is still in the center, but castling rights remain.
- Black's knight on c6 is well-placed, controlling key squares.
- White's rook on h3 is active, but not threatening immediate tactics.
- Black's bishop pair is undeveloped, but the light-squared bishop is blocked by pawns.

Candidate Moves:
1....Qxe4+: Immediate check, forcing White to respond. If White plays Nxe4, Black can recapture with the queen or develop further. This keeps the initiative.
2....Bd6/Bc5/Bb4: Developing the bishop, but less forcing than...Qxe4+.
3....Ng4: Retreats the knight, but loses tempo.
4....d6: Solidifies the center, but passive.
5....Nh6: Prepares...Ng4, but slow.

Tactical Considerations:
- After...Qxe4+, White must respond. Let's calculate:
    - 8...Qxe4+
        - 9.Nxe4 Bb4 (developing, pinning the knight)
        - Or 9.Bxe4 dxe4 10.Qxd8 Rxd8, Black is up a piece for a pawn.
        - Alternatively, 9.Be2 Qxc2+ 10.Kd1 Qxa2, Black wins material.

Strategic Considerations:
- The check forces White to react, giving Black time to develop and possibly attack the exposed white king.
- Capturing on e4 opens lines for Black's pieces and removes a central defender.

Conclusion:
The move...Qxe4+ is the most forcing and gives Black the best chances to seize the initiative and gain a material advantage.

2025-07-15 19:34:47,609 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 18.63s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 9. Rh3:
- White has castled kingside, and their king is relatively safe.
- Black's king is still in the center, but not immediately under threat.
- Black's queen is on e4, exerting pressure on the center and threatening various ideas.
- White's rook is on h3, eyeing the h-file, but not immediately dangerous.
- Black's knight on g4 is active, attacking f2 and h2.
- White's bishop pair is undeveloped, but they have some central pawns.

Candidate Moves:
1....Ng4-f6: Retreats the knight, keeps options open, but doesn't develop further.
2....Ng4-e5: Centralizes the knight, attacks d3 and threatens Nxd3+.
3....Ng4-h6: Prepares...Nh4, possibly doubling on the h-file.
4....Qxe7+: Checks the king, but after Kxe7, Black loses the queen for no compensation.
5....Qxf5: Captures a pawn, but White can recapture with the rook, and Black loses tempo.
6....Qxh3: Grabs the rook, but White can play Bxh3, and Black loses the queen for a rook.
7....Qe6: Retreats the queen, but seems passive.
8....Qe7: Retreats the queen, but blocks the bishop.
9....Qe5: Attacks the bishop on d2 and threatens Qxd2+.
10....Qe3: Threatens mate on f2, but White can defend with Be2 or Qe2.

Tactical Considerations:
- The most forcing move is...Qe3, threatening mate on f2.
- If White plays Be2, then...Qxf2 wins a piece.
- If White plays Qe2, then...Qxf2 is still strong.
- If White plays Rg3, then...Qxf2 is still strong.

Calculation:
1....Qe3
   - If 10. Be2 Qxf2 11. Qxf2 exf2, Black is up a pawn and has a strong attack.
   - If 10. Qe2 Qxf2 11. Qxf2 exf2, same result.
   - If 10. Rg3 Qxf2 11. Qxf2 exf2, again, Black is up a pawn.

Conclusion:
The move...Qe3 is very strong, threatening mate and winning material regardless of how White responds.

Final Move:
```
e4e3
```

2025-07-15 19:35:57,329 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 27.92s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 9...exf3:
- White's king is still in the center, but has castled queenside.
- Black's queen is very active on e3, threatening various checks and attacks.
- Black's knight on g4 is well-placed, attacking f2 and h2.
- White's rook on h3 is awkwardly placed, and the bishop on d2 is not doing much.
- Black's development is ahead, and White's kingside is vulnerable.

Candidate moves:
1. Qxf2+: Immediate check, forcing the king to move. After Kd1, Black can continue developing or attack further.
2. Nxh2: Captures a pawn, threatens mate on f1, and wins material.
3. Qxh3: Wins a pawn, but less forcing than the other options.
4. Qe4: Centralizes the queen, but not as strong as the direct threats.
5. Nf6: Develops a piece, but doesn't exploit the initiative.

Tactical considerations:
- Qxf2+ forces the king to move, and after Kd1, Black can play Nxh2, winning another pawn and threatening mate.
- Nxh2 immediately wins a pawn and threatens mate, but White can play Rg1 to block.
- Qxh3 wins a pawn, but is not as forcing.

Calculation:
- 1...Nxh2 2.Rg1 Qxh3 3.Bxh3 Nf3+ 4.Kd1 Ng5 (threatening mate)
- 1...Qxf2+ 2.Kd1 Nxh2 3.Ng5 (forking queen and rook) but Black can play Qxg5

But let's look at the most forcing line:
- 1...Qxf2+ 2.Kd1 Nxh2 3.Ng5 Qxg5 4.exg5 Nf3+ 5.Ke2 Ne5+ 6.Kf2 Nxd2+ 7.Ke3 Nxc4

Black is up a full rook and has a decisive attack.

Conclusion:
The best move is:
```
e3f2+
```
