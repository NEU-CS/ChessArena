White has all pieces available for development\n3. Black hasn't made any moves yet\n4. The most common and best opening moves are:\n   - 1.e4 (e2e4) - controls center, opens lines\n   - 1.Nf3 (g1f3) - develops knight, prepares castling\n   - 1.Nc3 (b1c3) - develops knight but blocks c-pawn\n\nCandidate moves worth considering:\n1. e2e4 - most classical opening move, controls center\n2. g1f3 - develops knight, prepares castling\n3. b1c3 - develops knight but less flexible than Nf3\n4. Other pawn moves - less ambitious than above options\n\nEvaluation:\n- e2e4 is the most principled move, immediately contesting the center\n- g1f3 is also good but slightly less ambitious than e4\n- b1c3 is playable but blocks the c-pawn which might be useful for castling\n- Other moves don't develop pieces or contest the center\n\nBest choice:\nThe most standard and strongest move in this position is 1.e4 (e2e4). It immediately controls the center, opens lines for the queen and light-squared bishop, and is the foundation of many opening systems.\n\n```\ne2e4\n```",

If ...Qxf5, White can play Nxe5, gaining a tempo and attacking the queen.\n2. Nxe5: Not possible, as the knight is on f3 and e5 is not attacked.\n3. Bc4/Bb5: Developing moves, but e4f5 is more forcing.\n4. d4: Not possible, as the pawn is on e4.\n5. h3: Prevents ...Bg4, but not urgent.\n\nCalculation:\n- 4. e4f5 Qxf5 (forced, otherwise Black loses the bishop)\n- 5. Nxe5 (if possible), but the knight is on f3, so not possible.\n- 5. Bb5+ (if the bishop was on c1), but not possible.\n- 5. d3 (if the pawn was on d2), but not possible.\n\nBut after 4. e4f5 Qxf5, White can play Nxe5, but the knight is on f3, so not possible.\n\nAlternative:\n- 4. Nxe5 (if possible), but the knight is on f3, so not possible.\n- 4.
