You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-07-16 15:44:21,951 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 2.46s):
Let's analyze the position:

- It's the starting position (after 1. e4 e5, but here it's still the initial position).
- White to move.
- The most common and strongest moves here are 1. e4 (e2e4), 1. Nf3 (g1f3), 1. Nc3 (b1c3), and 1. d4 (d2d4).

Candidate moves:
1. e2e4: The most classical and flexible move, opening the center and preparing for development.
2. g1f3: Develops a knight, attacks e5, and prepares for castling.
3. b1c3: Develops the other knight, but less flexible than Nf3.
4. d2d4: Another central opening, but e4 is more flexible.
5. Other pawn moves (h2h3, g2g3, etc.): Less ambitious, don't develop pieces.

Best move:
- e2e4 is the most principled, opening the center and allowing for rapid development. It's the main line in most openings and keeps maximum flexibility.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e2e4
```

2025-07-16 15:45:10,866 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 2.04s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.

Current position assessment:
- White has played e4, controlling the center
- Black has responded with d5, challenging the center
- This is a standard opening position from the Open Game

Let me consider the candidate moves:

1. e4d5: Capturing the pawn would win material, but after exd5, Black gets a strong pawn center.

2. b1c3: Developing the knight to a natural square, supporting e4 and preparing for castling.

3. g1f3: Developing the knight to a natural square, controlling important central squares.

4. f1c4: Developing the bishop to an active diagonal, targeting f7.

5. d2d4: Pushing the d-pawn to challenge Black's center.

The most principled move here is to capture the d5 pawn, as it's a direct challenge to Black's center and wins material. After e4d5, Black will likely recapture with the e-pawn (exd5), giving White a strong pawn center.

```
e4d5

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3

Move history: 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5

White to move.

Position assessment:
- Black has just played ...Qxd5, attacking the d5 pawn (which is gone) and threatening to take on e4 if White plays f4 or f3.
- White's development is behind; all minor pieces are still on their original squares.
- Black's queen is centralized, but White can start developing and contest the center.

Candidate moves:
1. Nf3: Develops a knight, attacks the queen, and prepares to castle.
2. Nc3: Develops a knight, supports d5, but doesn't attack the queen.
3. Bc4: Develops a bishop, eyes f7, but doesn't attack the queen.
4. d4: Pushes in the center, but after ...Qe5, Black's queen is very active.
5. h3: Prevents ...Bg4, but is slow.
6. f3: Blocks the queen's diagonal, but weakens the kingside.
7. Qf3: Attacks the queen, but is premature and blocks the bishop.

Critical lines:
- 3. Nf3 Qe5: Black's queen is very active, but White can castle and develop.
- 3. Nf3 Qe5 4. Nc3 Qg5: Black's queen is very active, but White is fine.
- 3. Nf3 Qe5 4. Nc3 Qg5 5. d4: White can contest the center.

Best move:
- Nf3 is the most natural, developing a piece, attacking the queen, and preparing to castle. Black's queen is active, but White can handle it.

Final move:
```

2025-07-16 15:46:52,149 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 4.34s):
Let's analyze the position:

FEN: r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4

Move history: 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nf3 Nc6

White to move.

Material:
- White: Up a pawn (since Black's queen is on d5, but White has not lost any pawns yet).
- Black: Queen is centralized, but White has a lead in development and more central control.

Key features:
- Black's queen is on d5, but not attacked.
- White's knight on f3 is well-placed.
- White's development is behind (only one knight out, no bishops or queen).
- Black's king is still in the center, and Black's development is also behind.

Candidate moves:
1. Nc3: Develops a piece, supports d5, and prepares to castle.
2. Bd3/Bc4/Bb5: Develops a bishop, possibly pinning or putting pressure on Black's queenside.
3. d4: Strikes at the center, but Black can respond with Qxd4 or Qe6.
4. h3: Prevents ...Bg4, but not urgent.
5. a3: Prepares b4, but not urgent.
6. Qe2: Develops the queen, but not necessary yet.

Deeper analysis:

- Nc3: Develops a piece, supports d5, and prepares to castle. If Black plays ...Qe6, White can castle and then bring the queen out. If Black plays ...Qxd4, White can play Nxd4 and recapture with the queen.
- Bd3: Develops a piece, but blocks the c1-bishop and does not support d5.
- Bc4: Develops a piece, but does not support d5.
- d4: If ...Qxd4, White can play Nxd4 and recapture with the queen. If ...Qe6, White can castle and then bring the queen out.

Best move:

Nc3 is the most natural, developing a piece, supporting d5, and preparing to castle. It keeps the initiative and does not allow Black to gain any tempo.

Final move:
```
b1c3

2025-07-16 15:47:53,712 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 6.36s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 5...Qd5:
- Black's queen is centralized on d5, but not yet threatening anything immediate.
- Black's bishop on d7 is undeveloped.
- White has a lead in development and more central control.
- White's knight on f3 and c3 are well placed.
- White's king is still in the center, but Black's king is also uncastled.
- White has a space advantage and more options for development.

Candidate moves:
1. c3d5: Captures the queen, but after Qxd5, Black's queen is still active, and White loses a knight.
2. f3g5: Attacks the queen, but Black can play Qxg5, and White loses a knight.
3. f3e5: Attacks the queen, but Black can play Qxe5, and White loses a knight.
4. f3d4: Attacks the queen, but Black can play Qxd4, and White loses a knight.
5. f3g1: Retreats the knight, but loses time.
6. c3b5: Attacks the queen, but Black can play Qxb5, and White loses a knight.
7. c3e4: Attacks the queen, but Black can play Qxe4, and White loses a knight.
8. c3a4: Attacks the queen, but Black can play Qxa4, and White loses a knight.
9. c3e2: Retreats the knight, but loses time.
10. c3b1: Retreats the knight, but loses time.
11. h1g1: Castles, but loses time.
12. f1a6: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the queen.
13. f1b5: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the queen.
14. f1c4: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the queen.
15. f1d3: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the queen.
16. f1e2: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the queen.
17. e1e2: King move, but loses time.
18. d1e2: Queen move, but doesn't address the queen.
19. a1b1: Rook move, but doesn't address the queen.
20. h2h3: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.
21. g2g3: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.
22. d2d3: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.
23. b2b3: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.
24. a2a3: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.
25. h2h4: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.
26. g2g4: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.
27. d2d4: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.
28. b2b4: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.
29. a2a4: Pawn move, but doesn't address the queen.

Best move:
- The only move that doesn't lose material is to capture the queen with c3d5. After c3d5, Black must recapture with Qxd5, and White can continue development.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c3d5
```

2025-07-16 15:48:37,342 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 3.36s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 5...f6:
- Black's king is still in the center, and the f6 pawn is weak.
- White has a strong knight on d5, attacking the c7 pawn and threatening to jump to e7 or f6.
- Black's bishop on d7 is passive, and the c6 knight is not well placed.
- White has a lead in development and more central control.

Candidate moves:
1. d5f6: Captures the pawn, but after gxf6, Black's king is still in the center and White can continue development.
2. d5e7+: Forks king and rook, but after Kxe7, White loses the knight for a pawn.
3. d5c7: Attacks the bishop, but Black can play Bxc7, and White loses the knight.
4. f3g5: Develops the knight, threatens f7, but Black can defend.
5. f1c4: Develops the bishop, eyes f7, but not as forcing as capturing on f6.
6. d2d4: Opens the center, but Black can play fxe5.

Critical calculation:
- d5f6: If Black plays gxf6, White can play Nc3, developing and keeping the initiative. If Black plays Kxf6, White can play Bc4, developing with tempo.
- d5e7+: After Kxe7, White loses the knight for a pawn, which is not optimal.
- f3g5: If Black plays h6, White can play Nf6+ and win the rook, but Black can play Kxf6.

Best move:
- d5f6 is the most forcing, wins a pawn, and keeps the initiative. After gxf6, White can continue development with tempo.

Final move:
```
d5f6
```

2025-07-16 15:49:28,449 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 6.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 6...Kf7:
- Black's king is on f7, exposed.
- White's knight is on f6, attacking the rook on h8 and the bishop on d7.
- White's knight on f3 is well placed.
- White's queen and bishop are ready to join the attack.
- Black's pieces are somewhat awkwardly placed, especially the bishop on d7 and knight on c6.

Candidate moves:
1. f6g8: Knight takes rook, but after ...Rxg8, Black's king is still exposed.
2. f6e8: Knight takes rook, but after ...Rxg8, same as above.
3. f6h7: Knight attacks the king, but Black can play ...Kg7.
4. f6d7: Knight takes bishop, but after ...cxd7, Black's king is still exposed.
5. f6h5: Knight attacks the king, but Black can play ...Kg7.
6. f6d5: Knight attacks the king, but Black can play ...Kg7.
7. f6g4: Knight attacks the king, but Black can play ...Kg7.
8. f6e4: Knight attacks the king, but Black can play ...Kg7.
9. f3g5: Knight attacks the king, but Black can play ...Kg7.
10. f3e5: Knight attacks the king, but Black can play ...Kg7.
11. f3h4: Knight attacks the king, but Black can play ...Kg7.
12. f3d4: Knight attacks the king, but Black can play ...Kg7.
13. f3g1: Retreat, not useful.
14. h1g1: Queen move, not useful.
15. f1a6: Bishop move, not useful.
16. f1b5: Bishop move, not useful.
17. f1c4: Bishop move, not useful.
18. f1d3: Bishop move, not useful.
19. f1e2: Bishop move, not useful.
20. e1e2: King move, not useful.
21. d1e2: Queen move, not useful.
22. a1b1: Rook move, not useful.
23. h2h3, g2g3, d2d3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, d2d4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4: Pawn moves, not useful.

Tactical considerations:
- The knight on f6 is very strong, attacking multiple pieces.
- The king on f7 is exposed.
- Taking the rook on h8 with the knight (f6g8) wins material and keeps the attack going.
- Taking the bishop on d7 with the knight (f6d7) also wins material, but the rook is more valuable.

Conclusion:
The best move is to take the rook on h8 with the knight, winning material and keeping the attack going.

My move is:
```
f6g8
```

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: r4bNr/ppp1pkpp/2n5/8/6b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 8

White to move.

Material:
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns

King Safety:
- Black's king is on f7, exposed, with no pawn cover and limited escape squares.
- White's king is safe on e1.

Piece Activity:
- White's knight on g8 is very active, threatening to jump into e7 or h6.
- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning the knight on f3 to the queen on d1.
- Black's knight on c6 is well-placed, but not immediately threatening.
- Black's bishop on f8 is undeveloped.

Immediate Tactics:
- The knight on g8 can jump to e7, threatening to fork the king and rook on a8.
- The knight on f3 can jump to g5, attacking the bishop on g4 and threatening to fork on e6.
- The bishop on f1 can develop to a6, b5, c4, d3, or e2.
- The queen on d1 can move to e2, unpinning the knight on f3.

Candidate Moves:
1. g8e7: Knight to e7, threatening to fork king and rook.
2. f3g5: Knight to g5, attacking bishop on g4.
3. f1a6: Bishop to a6, pinning the knight on c6.
4. d1e2: Queen to e2, unpinning knight on f3.
5. h1g1: Rook to g1, possibly preparing to double on the g-file.

Deeper Analysis:
- g8e7: If 8. Nxe7, Black can play Kxe7, but then White can play Bc4, threatening mate on f7. Black's king is very exposed.
- f3g5: If 8. Ng5, Black can play Bxg5, but then White can play Qxg5, threatening mate on f7.
- f1a6: If 8. Ba6, Black can play Nxa6, but then White can play Nxe7, forking king and rook.
- d1e2: If 8. Qe2, Black can play Bxe2, but then White can play Nxe7, forking king and rook.

Best Move:
- g8e7 is the most forcing, threatening to win material and keep the attack going.

Final Move:
```
g8e7
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

2025-07-16 15:51:52,209 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 17.55s):
Let's analyze the position:

FEN: r4b1r/p1p1Nkpp/2n5/1p6/6b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 9

White to move.

Material:
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns

King Safety:
- Black's king is on f7, somewhat exposed.
- White's king is still on e1, with castling rights.

Piece Activity:
- White's knight on e7 is very active, deep in enemy territory.
- White's knight on f3 is well placed.
- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning the f3 knight to the king.
- Black's bishop on f8 is undeveloped.
- Black's knight on c6 is defending b4 and d4.
- Black's rook on h8 is undeveloped.

Candidate Moves:
1. e7g8: Knight takes rook, but Black can play ...Bxg8, regaining the rook.
2. e7c8: Knight takes rook, but Black can play ...Bxc8, regaining the rook.
3. e7g6: Knight attacks f8 bishop and threatens to fork king and rook with ...Nxh8.
4. e7c6: Knight attacks b4 and d4, but not very forcing.
5. e7f5: Knight attacks g7 and e6, but not very forcing.
6. e7d5: Knight attacks c7 and e6, but not very forcing.
7. f3g5: Knight attacks f7 king, but Black can play ...Kxg5.
8. f3e5: Knight attacks f7 king, but Black can play ...Kxe5.
9. f3h4: Knight attacks g6 and f5, but not very forcing.
10. f3d4: Knight attacks c6 and e6, but not very forcing.
11. f3g1: Retreat, not useful.
12. h1g1: Rook to g1, but not very useful.
13. f1b5: Bishop attacks c6 knight, but not very forcing.
14. f1c4: Bishop attacks b5 pawn, but not very forcing.
15. f1d3: Bishop attacks c6 knight, but not very forcing.
16. f1e2: Bishop attacks c6 knight, but not very forcing.
17. e1e2: King move, not useful.
18. d1e2: Queen move, not useful.
19. a1b1: Rook move, not useful.
20. h2h3: Pawn move, not useful.
21. g2g3: Pawn move, not useful.
22. d2d3: Pawn move, not useful.
23. c2c3: Pawn move, not useful.
24. b2b3: Pawn move, not useful.
25. a2a3: Pawn move, not useful.
26. h2h4: Pawn move, not useful.
27. d2d4: Pawn move, not useful.
28. c2c4: Pawn move, not useful.
29. b2b4: Pawn move, not useful.
30. a2a4: Pawn move, not useful.

Key Tactical Idea:
- The knight on e7 is very strong. If we play e7g6, it attacks the bishop on f8 and threatens to take on h8 if the bishop moves. Also, if Black plays ...Bxg6, then White can play Qxg6, winning a bishop for a knight, but keeping the initiative.

Calculation:
- 1. Nf3g5+ Kxg5 (forced)
- 2. Qxg5+ Kf6 (only move)
- 3. Qg6+ Ke7
- 4. Qg7+ Kd6
- 5. Qg6+ Kc7
- 6. Qg7+ Kb8
- 7. Qg8+ Kxa8

But after 1. Nf3g5+ Kxg5, Black's king is exposed, but White's queen is not yet developed.

Let's re-express the move correctly in UCI notation, ensuring it's properly formatted.

The best move is to play the knight from e7 to g6, attacking the bishop on f8 and threatening to take on h8 if the bishop moves. This move also puts pressure on Black's king.

2025-07-16 15:52:54,268 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 4.78s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 9...Ne5:

- Black's king is on f7, somewhat exposed.
- Black's bishop on g4 is active, but not threatening immediate tactics.
- Black's knight on e5 is centralized, but not attacking anything directly.
- White's knight on g6 is very strong, attacking f8 and h8, and threatening to jump to e7 or e5.
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, and White has a lead in development.
- White's bishop on c1 is undeveloped, but can be developed quickly.
- White's queen and rooks are ready to join the attack.

Candidate moves:
1. g6e7: Knight takes bishop, threatening to fork king and rook on f8.
2. g6f8: Knight takes rook, but Black can play Kxf8, and White loses the knight for a rook.
3. g6h8: Knight takes rook, but Black can play Kxh8, and White loses the knight for a rook.
4. f3g5: Knight attacks the bishop on g4, but Black can play ...Bxg5, and White loses a knight.
5. f3e5: Knight takes knight, but Black can play ...Bxe5, and White loses a knight.
6. f1b5: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
7. d1e2: Develops the queen, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
8. h1g1: Castles queenside, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.

Tactical considerations:
- g6e7 is the most forcing move, threatening to win a rook and keep the attack going.
- After g6e7, if Black plays ...Bxe7, White can play Nxe7, and White is up a rook for a bishop.
- If Black plays ...Kxe7, White can play Nxe7, and White is up a rook for a knight.
- If Black plays ...Rxe7, White can play Nxe7, and White is up a rook for a rook, but Black's king is still exposed.

Strategic considerations:
- White is ahead in development and has a lead in initiative.
- Black's king is exposed, and White should press the attack.

Conclusion:
The best move is to play g6e7, attacking the bishop and threatening to win a rook.

My move:
```
g6e7
```

2025-07-16 15:54:19,498 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 5.27s):
Let's analyze the position:

Material:
- White: Rooks (a1, h1), Bishop (c1), Knight (e7, f3), Queen (d1), King (e1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: Rooks (a8, h8), Bishop (f5), Knight (e5), King (f7), pawns (a7, b5, c7, g7, h7)

Key features:
- White's knight on e7 is very active, attacking c8 and g8.
- Black's king is exposed on f7.
- Black's bishop on f5 and knight on e5 are centralized.
- White's queen and bishop are ready to join the attack.
- Black's rooks are not yet active.

Candidate moves:
1. e7g8: Knight to g8, threatening to fork king and rook with Nf6.
2. e7c8: Knight to c8, threatening to win the rook on a8.
3. f3g5: Knight to g5, attacking f7 and h7.
4. f3e5: Knight to e5, attacking f7 and d7.
5. f3h4: Knight to h4, attacking g6 and f5.
6. f3d4: Knight to d4, attacking c6 and e6.
7. f1b5: Bishop to b5, attacking c6 and threatening to exchange bishops.
8. d1e2: Queen to e2, centralizing and possibly supporting an attack.

Tactical considerations:
- e7g8: If ...Kxg8, then Qd8+ wins the rook on h8. If ...Rg8, then Nf6+ forks king and rook.
- e7c8: If ...Rxc8, then Nxc8, winning a rook.
- f3g5: Threatens f7, but Black can defend with ...Ke8 or ...Kg8.
- f3e5: Threatens f7, but Black can play ...Kg8.

Calculation:
- e7g8: 
    - If ...Kxg8, then Qd8+ wins the rook on h8.
    - If ...Rg8, then Nf6+ forks king and rook.
    - If ...Kg8, then Qd8+ wins the rook.
    - If ...Rg8, then Nf6+ wins the rook.

Conclusion:
- e7g8 is a strong move, threatening to win material and expose the king.

Final move:
```
e7g8
```

2025-07-16 15:56:24,182 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 3.79s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.

Current assessment:
- Material: White has a knight on g8, knight on f3, bishop on c1, queen on d1, king on e1, and pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2
- Black has a rook on a8, bishop on c5, knight on e5, bishop on f5, king on f7, and pawns on a7, c7, f7, g7, h7
- White's knight on g8 is attacking Black's rook on a8
- Black's pieces are somewhat active with the bishops on c5 and f5 controlling important diagonals

Let me consider the candidate moves:

1. g8e7 - Capturing the rook would win material, but is it safe? After 1...Bxe7, White would lose the knight.

2. f3g5 - Attacking the bishop on f5. This could win material if Black can't defend.

3. f3e5 - Capturing the knight on e5 would win material.

4. f1b5 - Developing the bishop to attack the c7 pawn.

5. d1e2 - Developing the queen to a safer square.

Looking at the position more deeply:
- The knight on g8 is attacking the rook on a8, but capturing it would lose the knight to Bxe7
- The knight on f3 can capture the knight on e5 with check (f3e5+), winning material
- The bishop on f5 is defended by the knight on e5
- The bishop on c5 is controlling the a7-g1 diagonal

The move f3e5+ stands out as it wins material with check. After 1...Kxe5, White can play 2. Nxe5+ winning the bishop on f5.

```
f3e5

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-07-16 15:59:48,367 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 4.23s):
Let's analyze the position:

Material:
- White: Rooks on a1, h1; Bishop on c1; Queen on d1; King on e1; Knights on f7, g8; Pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: Rook on a8; Bishop on c5, h3; King on e8; Pawns on a7, c7, g7, h7.

Key features:
- White is up a full rook and a pawn.
- Black's king is exposed on e8.
- White's knight on f7 is very strong, attacking the king and threatening to jump to e5 or h5.
- White's knight on g8 is also well-placed, attacking h6 and f6.
- Black's bishop on h3 is active, but not threatening immediate tactics.
- White's queen and rooks are ready to join the attack.

Candidate moves:
1. f7e5: Knight to e5, threatening to jump to f7 or g6, and possibly Qd8+.
2. f7h5: Knight to h5, threatening Qh7.
3. f7d6: Knight to d6, threatening Qd8+.
4. d1h5: Queen to h5, threatening Qh7.
5. g8f6: Knight to f6, threatening Nxe8.
6. g8h6: Knight to h6, threatening Nxg8.
7. f1b5: Bishop to b5, pinning the c7 pawn.

Tactical considerations:
- f7e5: If 14. Nxe5, then Qd8+ is possible, but Black can block with ...Qe7.
- f7h5: If 14. Nxh5, then Qh7 is mate.
- f7d6: If 14. Nxd6, then Qd8+ is possible, but Black can block with ...Qe7.
- g8f6: If 14. Nxf6, then exf6, and White can play Qd8+.

Calculation:
- 14. Nxh5 Qh7 is checkmate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f7h5
```
2025-07-16 15:59:48,368 - WARNING - Illegal move: f7h5 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one. Note that we have give you all legal moves. Don't add "x" or "+" in UCI of your answer.

2025-07-16 15:59:50,852 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 2.48s):
Let's re-examine the legal moves and the position.

The move f7h5 is not legal, as the knight on f7 cannot move to h5 in one move. The legal moves are:

- g8e7, g8h6, g8f6, f7h8, f7d8, f7h6, f7d6, f7g5, f7e5, h1g1, f1b5, f1c4, f1d3, f1e2, e1e2, d1h5, d1g4, d1f3, d1e2, a1b1, g2h3, g2g3, f2f3, d2d3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, g2g4, f2f4, d2d4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4

Given that f7h5 is not legal, let's look for the next best move.

The knight on f7 is attacking the king, and the knight on g8 is also well-placed. The move g8f6 is legal and very strong, as it threatens Nxe8, winning the rook.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g8f6
```

2025-07-16 16:01:36,799 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 8.92s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 14...f6:
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1/h1, Bishops on c1/f1, Knights on f7/b1, Pawns on a2/b2/c2/d2/f2/g2/h2
- Black: King on e8, Queen off the board, Rooks on a8/h8, Bishops on c5/h3, Knights off the board, Pawns on a7/b6/c7/f6/g6/h7

Material:
- White: Up a full rook and a pawn (White has both rooks, Black has neither).
- Black: Down a full rook and a pawn.

Threats:
- White's knight on f7 is very strong, threatening to invade the 8th rank.
- Black's bishop on h3 is active, but not threatening immediate tactics.
- Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle.

Candidate moves:
1. f7h8 (Nf7-h8): Knight to h8, threatening to invade the 8th rank and possibly promote if the rook moves.
2. f7d8 (Nf7-d8): Knight to d8, threatening to invade the 8th rank and possibly promote if the rook moves.
3. f7h6 (Nf7-h6): Knight to h6, attacking the bishop on h3.
4. f7d6 (Nf7-d6): Knight to d6, attacking the bishop on c5.
5. f7g5 (Nf7-g5): Knight to g5, attacking the bishop on h3.
6. f7e5 (Nf7-e5): Knight to e5, attacking the bishop on c5.
7. h1g1 (Rh1-g1): Rook to g1, possibly preparing to double on the g-file.
8. f1b5 (Bf1-b5): Bishop to b5, attacking the bishop on c5.
9. f1c4 (Bf1-c4): Bishop to c4, attacking the bishop on c5.
10. f1d3 (Bf1-d3): Bishop to d3, attacking the bishop on c5.
11. f1e2 (Bf1-e2): Bishop to e2, attacking the bishop on c5.
12. e1e2 (Ke1-e2): King to e2, possibly to connect rooks.
13. d1h5 (Qd1-h5): Queen to h5, attacking the bishop on h3.
14. d1g4 (Qd1-g4): Queen to g4, attacking the bishop on h3.
15. d1f3 (Qd1-f3): Queen to f3, attacking the bishop on h3.
16. d1e2 (Qd1-e2): Queen to e2, attacking the bishop on h3.
17. a1b1 (Ra1-b1): Rook to b1, possibly attacking the bishop on c5.
18. g2h3 (g2-h3): Pawn to h3, capturing the bishop.
19. g2g3 (g2-g3): Pawn to g3, attacking the bishop.
20. f2f3 (f2-f3): Pawn to f3, attacking the bishop.
21. d2d3 (d2-d3): Pawn to d3, attacking the bishop.
22. c2c3 (c2-c3): Pawn to c3, attacking the bishop.
23. b2b3 (b2-b3): Pawn to b3, attacking the bishop.
24. a2a3 (a2-a3): Pawn to a3, attacking the bishop.
25. g2g4 (g2-g4): Pawn to g4, attacking the bishop.
26. f2f4 (f2-f4): Pawn to f4, attacking the bishop.
27. d2d4 (d2-d4): Pawn to d4, attacking the bishop.
28. c2c4 (c2-c4): Pawn to c4, attacking the bishop.
29. b2b4 (b2-b4): Pawn to b4, attacking the bishop.
30. a2a4 (a2-a4): Pawn to a4, attacking the bishop.

Tactical considerations:
- The knight on f7 is very strong and can invade the 8th rank.
- The bishop on h3 is attacked by multiple pieces.
- The bishop on c5 is attacked by multiple pieces.

Best move:
- The move g2h3 (g2-h3) captures the bishop on h3, winning more material and further increasing White's advantage.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g2h3
```

2025-07-16 16:03:04,661 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 2.61s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.

Current assessment:
- Material: White is up a knight for a pawn (+2 points)
- White has a knight on f7 that's attacking the black king
- Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited protection
- White has castling rights (KQ) but hasn't castled yet
- Black has a bishop on c5 that's active

Let me consider the candidate moves:

1. f7h8: Capturing the rook would win material, but is it safe?
2. f7d8: Capturing the king would be checkmate, winning the game
3. f7h6: Knight move attacking the h6 pawn
4. f1b5: Developing the bishop with tempo against the c5 bishop
5. d1h5: Queen move attacking the h5 square

The most obvious winning move is f7d8, which is checkmate. The knight on f7 is attacking the black king on e8, and moving to d8 would capture the king directly.

Let me double-check if there are any tactical issues with this move:
- After f7d8, Black has no legal moves (the king is in check and cannot escape)
- There are no pieces that can capture the knight on d8
- No discovered checks or threats from Black

This is clearly the best move, winning the game immediately.

```
f7d8

Let's analyze the position:

Material:
- White: Rooks on a1, h1; Bishop on c1; Queen on d1; King on e1; Knight on d8; Pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h3
- Black: Rooks on a8, h8; Bishop on d4; King on e8; Pawns on a5, b5, c6, f6, h7

Key features:
- White's knight is on d8, attacking the rook on a8 and the bishop on d4.
- Black's king is on e8, unable to castle.
- Black's bishop on d4 is very active, eyeing the kingside.
- White's king is still in the center, but can castle kingside.
- White's queen and bishop are undeveloped, but the knight on d8 is very active.

Candidate moves:
1. d8f7+: Knight check, forcing the king to move. If ...Kxf7, White can play Qh5+ and win the rook on h8.
2. d8b7: Attacks the rook on a8, but Black can defend with ...Bxb2.
3. d8e6: Attacks the bishop on d4, but Black can play ...Bxe6.
4. d8c6: Attacks the bishop on d4, but Black can play ...Bxc6.
5. h1g1: Prepares to castle, but not urgent.
6. f1b5: Develops the bishop, but not urgent.
7. d1h5: Threatens mate on f7, but Black can play ...Bf6.
8. d1g4: Develops the queen, but not urgent.
9. e1e2: King move, not urgent.
10. a1b1: Rook move, not urgent.

Tactical calculation:
- d8f7+: If ...Kxf7, then Qh5+ wins the rook on h8.
- If ...Kd7, then Nxe5+ wins the bishop on d4.
- If ...Kf8, then Nxe5+ wins the bishop on d4.

Let's check the lines:

Line 1:
1. Nf7+ Kxf7 (forced)
2. Qh5+ Kg8 (only move)
3. Qxh7+ Kf8
4. Qxh8+ Kxe8
5. Qxh7+ Kf8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```

2025-07-16 16:07:56,964 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 5.65s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 17...a5:
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on c1, Knight on f7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h3.
- Black: King on e8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishop on a7, pawns on a5, b6, f6, h7.

White to move.

Material:
- White is up a full rook (White has both rooks, Black has only one).
- White's knight is on f7, deep in enemy territory, attacking the rook on h8 and threatening to jump to h8 for mate.
- Black's king is on e8, unable to castle, and is very exposed.
- Black's bishop on a7 is not active.
- Black's rook on h8 is attacked by the knight on f7.

Immediate threats:
- The knight on f7 can capture the rook on h8 with check (Nf7h8+), winning the exchange.
- The knight can also jump to h6, threatening mate on f7.
- The knight can also jump to d6, threatening mate on e8.
- The knight can also jump to g5, threatening mate on f7.
- The knight can also jump to e5, threatening mate on f7.

Candidate moves:
1. Nf7h8+ (winning the exchange, but not the most forcing)
2. Nf7h6 (threatening mate on f7)
3. Nf7d6 (threatening mate on e8)
4. Nf7g5 (threatening mate on f7)
5. Nf7e5 (threatening mate on f7)

Let's check for tactics:
- After Nf7h8+, Black must play Kf8 (only move), then White can play Qd8+ (forking king and rook), winning the exchange and keeping the attack.
- After Nf7h6, Black has no good defense. If ...Kf8, then Qd8+ wins the exchange. If ...Ke7, then Qd7+ wins the exchange.
- After Nf7d6, Black has no good defense. If ...Kf8, then Qd8+ wins the exchange. If ...Ke7, then Qd7+ wins the exchange.
- After Nf7g5, Black has no good defense. If ...Kf8, then Qd8+ wins the exchange. If ...Ke7, then Qd7+ wins the exchange.
- After Nf7e5, Black has no good defense. If ...Kf8, then Qd8+ wins the exchange. If ...Ke7, then Qd7+ wins the exchange.

But the most forcing move is Nf7h8+, as it wins the exchange and keeps the attack.

Final move:
```
f7h8
```

- White has a huge material advantage and a decisive attack.

Candidate moves:
1. h8f7+: Knight check, forcing the king to move.
2. h8g6+: Knight check, but the king can go to f8.
3. d1h5: Queen attack on the h5 square, but not as forcing.
4. d1g4: Queen attack on the g4 square, but not as forcing.
5. d1f3: Queen attack on the f3 square, but not as forcing.
6. d1e2: Queen attack on the e2 square, but not as forcing.

Let's calculate h8f7+:
- 1. Nf7+ Kxf7 (forced)
- 2. Qxa8 (winning the rook)
- White is up a full rook and has a winning position.

Alternatively, after h8f7+, if Black plays Kd7, then Qxa8 wins the rook.

Is there any better move?
- h8f7+ is the most forcing and wins material immediately.

Final move:
```
h8f7
```

2025-07-16 16:13:13,253 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 10.45s):
Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: At a glance, the material seems relatively even. However, we need to consider the activity of the pieces and the pawn structure.
- Piece Activity: Our knight on f7 is well - placed, putting pressure on the opponent's position. Our bishops and queen have potential to be activated.
- Pawn Structure: The opponent has some pawn weaknesses on the queenside, and we have a solid pawn structure in the center.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. f7h8: This move takes the knight to the corner. While it might seem like a way to protect the king, it reduces the knight's activity and doesn't contribute much to an attack or improving our position.
2. f7d8: Moving the knight to d8 also takes it away from the action. It doesn't put pressure on the opponent's pieces and is not a very aggressive move.
3. f7h6: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on g7. However, it might expose the knight to potential counter - attacks and doesn't develop our other pieces.
4. f7d6: The knight on d6 attacks the opponent's pawn on c4 and also controls some central squares. It is a more active move compared to the previous ones.
5. f7g5: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on f6 and also puts pressure on the opponent's king position. But it might be a bit premature as the knight could be vulnerable to attacks.
6. f7e5: The knight on e5 attacks the opponent's pawn on d7 and also controls important central squares. It is a very active and aggressive move.
7. h1g1: Moving the rook to g1 is a defensive move. It doesn't contribute to an attack and is not a good option at this stage when we should be looking for offensive opportunities.
8. f1c4: Developing the bishop to c4 is a good move as it attacks the opponent's pawn on a5 and also controls important diagonals. It is a solid developing move.
9. f1d3: Moving the bishop to d3 is also a developing move. It controls some central squares and can potentially support an attack on the opponent's king.
10. f1g2: This move is a bit passive. It doesn't contribute much to an attack and is not a good option at this stage.
11. f1e2: Similar to f1g2, it is a passive move that doesn't help in putting pressure on the opponent.
12. e1e2: Moving the king to e2 is a defensive move. It doesn't contribute to an attack and is not a good option when we should be looking for offensive opportunities.
13. d1h5: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on g7 and also puts pressure on the opponent's king position. However, it might expose the queen to potential counter - attacks.
14. d1g4: Moving the queen to g4 is a very aggressive move. It attacks the opponent's pawn on f6 and also puts pressure on the opponent's king position. It is a strong attacking move.
15. d1f3: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on e5 and also controls some central squares. It is a good attacking move.
16. d1e2: Moving the queen to e2 is a passive move. It doesn't contribute much to an attack and is not a good option at this stage.
17. a1b1: Moving the rook to b1 is a defensive move. It doesn't contribute to an attack and is not a good option when we should be looking for offensive opportunities.
18. h3h4: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.
19. f2f3: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.
20. d2d3: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.
21. c2c3: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.
22. b2b3: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.
23. a2a3: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.
24. f2f4: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.
25. d2d4: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.
26. b2b4: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.
27. a2a4: This is a pawn move that doesn't contribute much to an attack. It is a passive move.

 Final Move Selection
The move d1g4 is the best move as it is a very aggressive move that attacks the opponent's pawn on f6 and also puts pressure on the opponent's king position. It forces the opponent to make a defensive move and gives us the initiative.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: At a glance, the material seems relatively even. However, we need to consider the activity and potential of each piece.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn structure, but we need to be cautious of any potential threats from the black pieces.
- Piece Activity: Our knight on f7 is well - placed, putting pressure on the black king's position. The queen on g4 is also in a good attacking position, threatening several squares around the black king.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. f7h8: This move takes the knight to the corner. While it might seem like a way to keep the knight active, it moves the knight away from the center and the area around the black king where it can cause more damage. It also doesn't directly address any immediate threats or create new ones.
2. f7d8: Moving the knight to d8 takes it to a square where it can potentially attack the black rook on a8. However, it also moves the knight further away from the action around the black king and doesn't put immediate pressure on the black king.
3. f7h6: This move brings the knight closer to the black king. It attacks the pawn on h7 and also controls some important squares around the black king. It can potentially force the black king to move or make other defensive moves.
4. f7d6: Moving the knight to d6 attacks the pawn on c4 and also controls some central squares. But it doesn't have as much direct impact on the black king as some of the other moves.
5. f7g5: This move attacks the pawn on f5 and also controls some squares around the black king. However, it doesn't put as much pressure on the black king as moving the knight to h6.
6. f7e5: Moving the knight to e5 attacks the pawn on d4 and also controls some central squares. But it doesn't have as much direct impact on the black king as moving the knight to h6.
7. g4g8: Moving the queen to g8 takes it to the back rank. While it might seem like a way to attack the black rook on a8, it moves the queen away from the area around the black king where it can cause more damage.
8. g4g7: Moving the queen to g7 attacks the pawn on h7. But it doesn't put as much pressure on the black king as moving the knight to h6.
9. g4g6: Moving the queen to g6 attacks the pawn on f5. But it doesn't have as much direct impact on the black king as moving the knight to h6.
10. g4h5: Moving the queen to h5 attacks the pawn on f5. But it doesn't put as much pressure on the black king as moving the knight to h6.
11. g4g5: Moving the queen to g5 attacks the pawn on f5. But it doesn't have as much direct impact on the black king as moving the knight to h6.
12. g4f5: Moving the queen to f5 attacks the pawn on f5. But it doesn't put as much pressure on the black king as moving the knight to h6.
13. g4h4: Moving the queen to h4 attacks the pawn on f5. But it doesn't have as much direct impact on the black king as moving the knight to h6.
14. g4f4: Moving the queen to f4 attacks the pawn on f5. But it doesn't put as much pressure on the black king as moving the knight to h6.

2025-07-16 16:17:15,093 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 3.06s):
Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: We have a knight, a queen, and several pawns. The opponent has a rook, a bishop, and pawns. Our queen and knight have a significant attacking potential.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn structure, while the opponent's king is a bit exposed on d7.
- Piece Activity: Our queen on g4 and knight on h6 are well - placed to launch attacks. The opponent's pieces seem to be less coordinated in terms of attacking our king.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. h6g8: This move brings the knight to a more central square. It can potentially attack the opponent's rook on a8 and also put pressure on the opponent's king. However, it moves the knight away from the immediate vicinity of the opponent's king.
2. g4g8: Moving the queen to g8 attacks the rook on a8. But it also moves the queen far from the action around the opponent's king.
3. g4h5: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on f5 and also puts pressure on the opponent's king. It keeps the queen in a position where it can potentially deliver a check or attack other pieces.

 Final Move Selection
After careful consideration, the move `g4h5` seems to be the best option. It attacks the opponent's pawn on f5, which is a weak point in their pawn structure. At the same time, it puts pressure on the opponent's king. If the opponent moves the pawn on f5, we can then bring our knight into play with a more powerful attack.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-07-16 16:24:58,500 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 17.70s):
Let's analyze the position:

Material:
- White: Queen (f7), Knight (h6), Rooks (a1, h1), Bishop (c1), King (e1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, h3)
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (a7), King (d8), pawns (a5, b5, c3, e5, h7)

King Safety:
- Black's king is exposed on d8, with no pawn cover and no pieces nearby.
- White's queen is on f7, dominating the 7th rank and the diagonal.
- White's knight on h6 is threatening to jump to g8 or f5.
- White's bishop on c1 is ready to join the attack.
- White's rooks are ready to swing into the attack.

Immediate Tactics:
- The Black king is on d8, and the queen on f7 is attacking the d7 square.
- The knight on h6 can jump to g8, threatening mate on d8.
- The move Qe7+ is not possible, but Qd7+ is possible, but the queen is already on f7.
- The move Qd7+ is not possible, but Qd7+ is not a legal move from f7.
- The move Qd7+ is not possible, but Qd7+ is not a legal move from f7.
