You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:

2025-07-16 15:44:41,136 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 1.88s):
I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black, and White has just played d2d4.

Current position assessment:
- White has advanced their d-pawn to d4, controlling the center
- I need to develop my pieces and contest the center
- The most natural developing moves are Nf6 and Nc6, which also contest the center

Let me consider the candidate moves:
1. g8f6 - Develops knight to a good square, contests e4, prepares castling
2. b8c6 - Develops knight, but doesn't contest the center as directly
3. e7e5 - Immediate central challenge, but might be premature
4. d7d5 - Another central challenge, but might lead to an open game

The most principled move is g8f6, developing a knight to a natural square while contesting the center. This follows opening principles perfectly.

```
g8f6
```

2025-07-16 15:45:29,724 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 3.76s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3

- White has played a standard opening, developing the knight to f3 and controlling the center with pawns.
- Black has developed the knight to f6, which is a common move in many openings.
- It's Black's turn to move.

Candidate moves:
1. e7e5: Strikes at the center, challenging White's d4 pawn. If White plays Nxe5, Black can recapture with the queen or knight. This is a main line in many openings.
2. d7d5: Another central break, but less common after Nf3.
3. b8c6: Develops the queenside knight, but doesn't contest the center immediately.
4. f6d5: Retreats the knight, but loses time.
5. e7e6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but is passive.
6. h7h6: Luft, but not necessary yet.
7. g7g6: Prepares Bg7, but is slow.
8. c7c5: Immediate queenside expansion, but White can play d5.

Analysis:
- e7e5 is the most principled move, contesting the center and opening lines for the bishop and queen.
- d7d5 is also possible, but after exd5, Nxd5, White can play Nxd5, and Black loses a pawn.
- b8c6 is solid, but doesn't contest the center.
- f6d5 is passive.
- e7e6 is too passive for an opening move.

Tactical considerations:
- After e7e5, if White plays Nxe5, Black can play d6, and after Nf3, Black can play Qe7 or Bb7, developing pieces.
- If White plays Nc3, Black can continue with d6 or Bb4.

Conclusion:
The best move is to strike in the center with e7e5.

My move:
```
e7e5
```

2025-07-16 15:46:21,293 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 2.75s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.

Current assessment:
- White has developed both knights and has a queen on d3
- Black has developed one knight to f6 and has a central pawn on e5
- White's d4 pawn is attacking Black's e5 pawn
- Black hasn't developed any other pieces yet

Let me consider the key candidate moves:

1. e5d4: Capturing the pawn with the e-pawn would open the e-file and relieve pressure, but after Nxd4, White maintains strong central control.

2. f6d5: Developing the knight to d5 attacks the queen on d3, forcing it to move. This would gain tempo and develop a piece.

3. b8c6: Developing the knight to c6 is a standard developing move that controls central squares.

4. f8b4+: A check that could disrupt White's position, but White can simply block with c3.

5. f8c5: Developing the bishop to an active diagonal.

Looking at f6d5 more closely: This move attacks the queen on d3. If White moves the queen, Black gains tempo and develops a piece. If White captures with the knight (Nxd5), Black recaptures with the queen (Qxd5) and has developed a piece while attacking White's knight.

I believe f6d5 is the strongest move here as it develops a piece, attacks the queen, and gains tempo.

```
f6d5

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:

2025-07-16 15:47:20,122 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 3.14s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 3...Nd5 4. Qg1

- White's queen is on g1, not threatening anything immediate.
- Black's knight is on d5, centralized and active.
- White's development is incomplete; the bishop on f1 and knight on b1 are still on their original squares.
- Black is up a tempo and has a lead in development.
- The e5 pawn is defended by the knight on d5.
- No immediate threats from White.

Candidate moves:
1. Nf6: Attacks the queen on g1, forcing it to move. This gains tempo and keeps the initiative.
2. Nc6: Develops a piece, but doesn't attack anything.
3. e4: Pushes the pawn, but the knight on d5 is attacked.
4. d6: Supports the e5 pawn, but is passive.
5. Qf6: Attacks the queen, but the queen can move.
6. Bc5: Develops a piece, but doesn't attack anything.

Tactical considerations:
- The queen on g1 is not defended.
- Nf6 attacks the queen and gains tempo.
- After Nf6, if Qg4, then ...Nxe4 wins a pawn.
- If Qh3, then ...Nxe4 is still strong.
- If Qf2, then ...Nxe4 is still strong.

Strategic considerations:
- Black is ahead in development and should maintain the initiative.
- Pressing with Nf6 keeps the attack and forces White to respond.

Conclusion:
The best move is to play Nf6, attacking the queen and gaining tempo.

My move:
```
d5f6

Let's analyze the position:

Position after 5. b4:
- White has a strong center with pawns on d4 and b4, and the queen on d3.
- Black's knight is on f6, and the e5 pawn is under pressure.
- Black's king is still in the center, and development is lagging.
- White threatens to play c4, increasing pressure on the center.
- The bishop on f8 is blocked by the e5 pawn.
- The knight on f6 is attacked by the queen on d3.

Candidate moves:
1. e5d4: Captures the pawn, but after cxd4, White has a strong center and open c-file.
2. f6d5: Retreats the knight, but it's passive.
3. f6g8: Retreats the knight, but it's passive.
4. f6h5: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qg3 or Qe1.
5. f6g4: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qg3 or Qe1.
6. f6e4: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qe1 or Qg3.
7. f8e7: Develops the bishop, but blocks the e-pawn.
8. f8d6: Develops the bishop, but blocks the d-pawn.

13. b8c6: Develops the knight, but doesn't address the e5 pawn.
14. b8a6: Develops the knight, but doesn't address the e5 pawn.
15. h7h6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but slow.
16. g7g6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but slow.
17. d7d6: Supports the e5 pawn, but blocks the bishop.
18. c7c6: Supports the d5 square, but blocks the bishop.
19. b7b6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but slow.

22. h7h5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but slow.
23. g7g5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but slow.
24. d7d5: Opens the center, but White can play c4.
25. c7c5: Opens the center, but White can play c4.
26. b7b5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but slow.
27. a7a5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but slow.

Critical lines:
- If 6...e5d4 7. cxd4, White has a strong center and open c-file.
- If 6...f6d5, White can play c4, increasing pressure.
- If 6...f6g8, White can play c4.
- If 6...f6h5, White can play Qg3.
- If 6...f6g4, White can play Qg3.
- If 6...f6e4, White can play Qe1.
- If 6...f8e7, White can play c4.
- If 6...f8d6, White can play c4.
- If 6...f8c5, White can play c4.
- If 6...f8b4, White can play Qxb4.
- If 6...b8c6, White can play c4.
- If 6...d7d6, White can play c4.
- If 6...d7d5, White can play c4.

Best move:
- The most active and challenging move is 6...f6e4, attacking the queen and threatening to win it. If White plays Qe1, Black can play Nxc3, winning a pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f6e4
```

Let's analyze the position:

Position after 6. a3:
- White has a strong center with pawns on b4, d4, e4, and f4.
- White's queen is on d3, eyeing the kingside.
- Black's knight is on e4, but it's under attack by the queen.
- Black's king is still in the center, and development is lagging.
- Black's e5 pawn is attacked by the queen and could be a target.

Immediate threats:
- The knight on e4 is attacked by the queen on d3.
- If the knight moves, White can play Qxe5, winning a pawn.
- Black's king is still in the center and could be vulnerable to a quick attack.

Candidate moves:
1. e4f6: Retreats the knight, but after Qxe5, White wins a pawn.
2. e4d6: Retreats the knight, but again Qxe5 wins a pawn.
3. e4g5: Attacks the queen, but after Qxg5, White wins a pawn.
4. e4c5: Retreats the knight, but Qxe5 wins a pawn.
5. e4g3: Attacks the queen, but after Qxg3, White wins a pawn.
6. e4c3: Retreats the knight, but Qxe5 wins a pawn.
7. e4f2: Retreats the knight, but Qxe5 wins a pawn.
8. e4d2: Retreats the knight, but Qxe5 wins a pawn.
9. e5d4: Captures the pawn, but after Qxe5, White wins a pawn.
10. f8e7: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
11. f8d6: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
12. f8c5: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
13. f8b4: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
14. e8e7: King move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
15. d8e7: Queen move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
16. d8f6: Queen move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
17. d8g5: Queen move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
18. d8h4: Queen move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
19. b8c6: Develops the knight, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
20. b8a6: Develops the knight, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
21. h8g8: Rook move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
22. h7h6: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
23. g7g6: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
24. f7f6: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
25. d7d6: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
26. c7c6: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
27. b7b6: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
28. a7a6: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
29. h7h5: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
30. g7g5: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
31. f7f5: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
32. d7d5: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
33. c7c5: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
34. b7b5: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
35. a7a5: Pawn move, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.

Best move:
- The knight on e4 is attacked by the queen on d3. If the knight moves, White can play Qxe5, winning a pawn. Therefore, we must address the threat to the knight.
- The best move is to retreat the knight to a safe square, but all retreats lose a pawn to Qxe5.
- The only way to avoid losing a pawn is to capture the queen, but that's not possible.

Let's re-express the move correctly in UCI notation, ensuring it's properly formatted.

After carefully analyzing the position, the best move for Black is to retreat the knight to a safe square. Among the options, moving the knight to c6 is a reasonable choice as it develops the knight and doesn't immediately lose material.

The correct UCI notation for this move is:

Let's analyze the position:

Position after 7. Nd2:

- White has developed both knights, has a strong center with pawns on d4 and e4, and the queen on d3 is well placed.
- Black's knight on e4 is centralized but could be attacked by Nxe4.
- Black's king is still in the center, and the bishop on f8 is undeveloped.
- White threatens to play Nxe4, attacking the queen and bishop.
- Black's queen is on d8, and the rook on a8 is undeveloped.
- Black's c6 knight is attacked by the queen on d3.

Candidate moves:
1. e4d2: Knight retreats, but loses a tempo and allows White to develop.
2. e4f2: Knight attacks the queen, but after Qxf2, White wins a pawn.
3. e4g5: Knight attacks the queen, but after Qxg5, White wins a pawn.
4. e4d6: Knight retreats, but loses a tempo.
5. f8b4: Bishop attacks the queen, but after Qxb4, White wins a pawn.
6. d8f6: Queen attacks the queen, but after Qxf6, White wins a pawn.

2025-07-16 15:51:31,270 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 4.42s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 8. f3:
- White: King on e1, Queen on d3, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishops on c1 and f1, Knights on d2 and g1, Pawns on a3, b4, d4, e3, f3, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishops on c8 and e7, Knights on c6 and e4, Pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e5, f7, g7, h7.

Key features:
- Black is up a piece (White is missing a knight and a bishop).
- Black's knight on e4 is centralized and strong.
- White's queen is on d3, eyeing the kingside.
- Black's king is still in the center, but White has no immediate threats.
- Black's bishop on e7 is well-placed, controlling the long diagonal.
- White's pieces are somewhat passive, especially the knights.

Candidate moves:
1. e4f2+: Knight check, forcing the king to move. After Kxf2, Black can play Qd2+ and win the queen.
2. e4g3: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qxg3.
3. e4d2: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qxd2.
4. e4c3: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qxc3.
5. e4f6: Retreats the knight, but loses the initiative.
6. e4d6: Retreats the knight, but loses the initiative.
7. e4g5: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qxg5.
8. e4c5: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qxc5.
9. e4f2+: This is the most forcing move, as it checks the king and wins the queen.

Calculation:
- 8...Nf2+ 9. Kxf2 Qd2+ 10. Kg1 (or Ke1) Qxg2+ 11. Kf1 (or Kf2) Qxg2, Black wins the queen and is completely winning.

Conclusion: The best move is to play the knight check, winning the queen.

My move:

2025-07-16 15:52:26,039 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 7.52s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 9. Nh3:
- White's king is still in the center, but Black has a strong initiative.
- Black's knight on f2 is attacking the rook on h1 and the bishop on c1.
- White's queen on d3 is defending the bishop on c1.
- Black's bishop on e7 is well-placed, and the knight on c6 is centralized.
- White's knight on h3 is awkwardly placed.
- Black is up a piece for a pawn (White has sacrificed a knight for a pawn).

Candidate moves:
1. f2h1: Captures the rook, but White can play Qxh1, and Black loses the knight for a rook.
2. f2d1: Captures the bishop, but White can play Qxd1, and Black loses the knight for a bishop.
3. f2g4: Attacks the knight on h3, but White can play Qxg4, and Black loses the knight for a queen.
4. f2e4: Centralizes the knight, attacks the queen, and threatens to win material.
5. e5e4: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
6. e7g5: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
7. e7f6: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
8. e7d6: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
9. e7h4: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
10. e7b4: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
11. e7c5: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
12. e7f8: Retreats the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
13. e7g5: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
14. e7d6: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
15. e7h4: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
16. e7b4: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
17. e7c5: Develops the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
18. e7f8: Retreats the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
19. e5d4: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
20. h7h6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
21. g7g6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
22. f7f6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
23. d7d6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
24. b7b6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
25. a7a6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
26. e5e4: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
27. h7h5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
28. g7g5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
29. f7f5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
30. d7d5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
31. b7b5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
32. a7a5: Prepares to develop the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.

Best move:
- The move f2e4 is very strong. It centralizes the knight, attacks the queen, and threatens to win material. If White plays Qe2, Black can play Nxc2, winning a pawn and keeping the initiative.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f2e4
```

Let's analyze the position:

Position after 10. Ng5:
- White's pieces are very active, especially the knight on g5 and the queen on d3.
- Black's king is still in the center, and the e-file is semi-open.
- Black's knight on e4 is centralized but could be a target.
- White threatens to play Qxe4, winning a piece.
- Black's bishop on e7 is pinned to the king by the knight on g5.
- Black's queen is on d8, and the rooks are on a8 and h8.

Immediate threats:
- Qxe4 is a threat, winning a piece.
- If Black plays ...Nf6, White can play Qxe4, and after Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.
- If Black plays ...Nf6, White can also play Qxe4, and after Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.

Candidate moves:
1. e4f6: Retreats the knight, but after Qxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.

10. e5d4: Retreats the pawn, but after Qxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.
11. h8g8: Rook to g8, but after Qxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.
12. h8f8: Rook to f8, but after Qxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.
13. a8b8: Rook to b8, but after Qxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.

25. g7g6: Pawn to g6, but after Qxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.
26. f7f6: Pawn to f6, but after Qxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.

34. a7a5: Pawn to a5, but after Qxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4, Black loses the bishop on e7.

Best move:
- The only move that avoids immediate loss of material is to play e7g5, capturing the knight with the bishop. This way, Black avoids losing the bishop on e7 and keeps the position more balanced.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e7g5
```

2025-07-16 15:54:32,770 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 6.68s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 10...g5:
- Black to move.
- White's last move: g3 (preventing ...Bg4).
- Black's pieces:
  - Rooks: a8, h8
  - Knights: c6, e4
  - Bishop: g5
  - Queen: d8
  - King: e8
  - Pawns: a7, b7, c7, d7, e5, f7, g7, h7
- White's pieces:
  - Rooks: a1, h1
  - Knights: d2, c3
  - Bishop: c1, f1
  - Queen: d3
  - King: e1
  - Pawns: a5, b2, c2, d4, f3, g3, h2

Key features:
- Black's knight on e4 is very strong, attacking d2 and f2.
- Black's bishop on g5 is pinning the f3 pawn to the king.
- White's queen on d3 is active, but not threatening immediate tactics.
- White's king is still in the center, but can castle kingside.
- Black's king is still in the center, but can castle kingside or queenside.

Candidate moves:
1. e4f2: Knight takes on f2, forking king and rook. White must recapture with the king (Kxf2), but then Black can play ...Qd5+ and win the queen.
2. e4d2: Knight takes on d2, attacking the queen and threatening ...Qd5+.
3. g5f4: Bishop takes on f4, attacking the queen and threatening ...Qd5+.
4. e8g8: Kingside castle, but not urgent.
5. d8f6: Queen to f6, attacking the queen and threatening ...Qxf3+.

Let's calculate the most forcing moves:

 1. e4f2
- 11...Nxf2 12.Kxf2 Qd5+ 13.Ke3 (or Kf3) Qxd3+ 14.Kf4 (or Ke4) Qxg3
- Black wins the queen and is up a piece.

 2. e4d2
- 11...Nxd2 12.Qxd2 Qd5+ 13.Ke3 (or Kf3) Qxd3+ 14.Kf4 (or Ke4) Qxg3
- Black wins the queen and is up a piece.

 3. g5f4
- 11...Bxf4 12.Qxf4 Qd5+ 13.Ke3 (or Kf3) Qxd3+ 14.Kf4 (or Ke4) Qxg3
- Black wins the queen and is up a piece.

 4. d8f6
- 11...Qf6 12.Qxf6 Nxf6 13.Nf4 (or Nf3) Nxe4
- Black wins a piece, but not as much as the above.

Conclusion:
All three moves (e4f2, e4d2, g5f4) win the queen and are crushing. Let's check for any tactics for White after e4f2:

- 11...Nxf2 12.Kxf2 Qd5+ 13.Ke3 Qxd3+ 14.Kf4 Qxg3
- White has no checks or threats.

Final move:
```
e4f2

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4

You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-07-16 15:55:24,378 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 6.59s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 11...d5:
- White: King on e1, Queen on d3, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on c1 and f1, Knight on d2 and c3, Pawns on a2, b4, d5, f3, g3, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishop on c8 and g5, Knight on f2 and c6, Pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e5, f7, g7, h7.

Material:
- Black is up a piece for a pawn (White is missing a knight, Black is missing a knight).
- Black's knight on f2 is very active, attacking the queen and threatening to fork on d3 or h3.
- White's queen is on d3, attacked by the knight on f2.
- Black's bishop on g5 is very strong, eyeing the f4 and h4 squares.
- White's king is still in the center, and Black's king is also in the center but can castle.

Immediate threats:
- The knight on f2 attacks the queen on d3.
- The bishop on g5 is very strong, and Black can consider moves like ...Bxf4, ...Bxh3, or ...Bxf3.
- Black can also consider castling, but the king is somewhat exposed.

Candidate moves:
1. Nxd3: Captures the queen, but after Qxd3, White is up a piece for a pawn.
2. Bxf4: Captures a pawn, but White can play Qxf4, and Black loses the bishop.
3. Bxh3: Captures a pawn, but White can play Qxh3, and Black loses the bishop.
4. Bxf3: Captures a pawn, but White can play Qxf3, and Black loses the bishop.
5. Nxd3: As above, but after Qxd3, White is up a piece for a pawn.
6. Castling: e8g8, but the king is exposed and White can play Qxf2+.
7. dxe4: Not possible, as the pawn is on e5.
8. h6: Not relevant.
9. d6: Not relevant.
10. Nxd3: As above.

Tactical considerations:
- If Black plays Nxd3, White can recapture with the queen, and Black is up a piece for a pawn.
- If Black plays Bxf4, White can play Qxf4, and Black loses the bishop.
- If Black plays Bxh3, White can play Qxh3, and Black loses the bishop.
- If Black plays Bxf3, White can play Qxf3, and Black loses the bishop.
- If Black plays Nxd3, White can play Qxd3, and Black is up a piece for a pawn.

Strategic considerations:
- Black is up a piece for a pawn, so material is roughly equal.
- Black's knight on f2 is very active, and the bishop on g5 is very strong.
- White's king is still in the center, and Black can try to open the center.

Best move:
- The move Nxd3 is the most forcing, as it wins a piece for a pawn. After Nxd3, White can recapture with the queen, and Black is up a piece for a pawn.

Final move:
```
f2d3
```

2025-07-16 15:56:19,723 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 18.06s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 12...Rd8-e8 (move history shows Black's last move was Rd8-e8, but the FEN shows the rook is on h8, so likely the last move was ...Rh8-g8 or ...Rh8-f8):

FEN: r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Pp1b1/1P6/P2n1PP1/2PNP2P/R1BK1B1R b kq - 1 13

Black to move.

Material:
- Black: Rooks on a8, h8; Bishop on c8, g5; Queen on d8; Knights on c6, d3; Pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e5, f7, g7, h7
- White: Rooks on a1, h1; Bishop on f1, g1; Queen off board; Knights on d2, c3; Pawns on a3, b2, d5, e4, f2, g3, h2

Key features:
- Black is up a piece (White is missing a knight and a bishop).
- White's king is on d1, somewhat exposed.
- Black's knight on d3 is very active, attacking b2 and f2.
- Black's bishop on g5 is pinning the f2 pawn to the king.
- Black's queen is on d8, ready to join the attack.
- White's bishop on f1 is undeveloped.
- White's knight on c3 is defending b2 and d4.

Candidate moves:
1. d3b2: Knight takes on b2, threatening to fork king and rook with ...Qd1.
2. d3f2: Knight takes on f2, threatening ...Qxf2+.
3. g5e3: Bishop takes on e3, attacking the rook on f1.
4. g5h4: Bishop retreat, but not aggressive.
5. e5e4: Pawn push, but not urgent.
6. d8e7: Queen to e7, supporting the attack.
7. h8g8: Rook to g8, possibly preparing ...Qg5.
8. e8g8: King to g8, but not necessary.

Tactical considerations:
- d3b2: If 13. Kxb2, then ...Qd1+ wins the rook on a1.
- d3f2: If 13. Kxf2, then ...Qxf2+ wins the rook on a1.
- g5e3: If 13. Bxe3, then ...Nxe3+ wins the bishop on f1.

2025-07-16 15:56:55,295 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 4.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 13...b2:
- Black to move.
- Material: Black is up a piece for a pawn (White is missing a knight and a pawn, Black is missing a knight and a pawn).
- White's king is on e1, bishop on c1, knight on d3, pawns on a3, b4, d5, f3, g3, h2.
- Black's king is on e8, bishop on g5, knight on b2, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e5, f7, g7, h7, rook on a8 and h8, queen on d8.

Key features:
- Black's knight on b2 is very active, threatening to jump to d3 or c4.
- Black's bishop on g5 is eyeing the f4 square and could be very strong.
- White's king is exposed on e1.
- White's knight on d3 is defending c1 and e1.
- Black's queen and rooks are undeveloped, but Black has a huge material advantage.

Candidate moves:
1. b2d3: Captures the knight, but after Bxd3, White's bishop is active.
2. b2c4: Attacks the bishop on c1 and threatens to invade.
3. b2d1: Attacks the rook on a1 and threatens to invade.
4. g5f4: Attacks the rook on a1 and threatens to invade.
5. e8g8: Castles kingside, but not urgent.
6. d8f6: Develops the queen, attacks the bishop on c1.
7. c6d4: Knight jump, attacks the bishop on c1.

Tactical considerations:
- b2d3 is a direct capture, but after Bxd3, White's bishop is active.
- b2c4 attacks the bishop and threatens to invade.
- g5f4 attacks the rook and threatens to invade.
- d8f6 develops the queen and attacks the bishop.

Best move:
- b2d3 is the most forcing, winning a piece. After Bxd3, Black can play Qxd3, and Black is up a full rook and bishop for a pawn, with a winning endgame.

Final move:
```
b2d3
```

2025-07-16 15:57:39,629 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-mix1) (took 5.02s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 14...e5-e4:
- White's king is on e1, and the bishop is on c1, rook on a1 and h1, knight on d2 and c3, pawns on a3, b4, d5, f3, g3, h2.
- Black's king is on e8, rook on a8 and h8, bishop on c8 and g5, knight on c6, queen on d8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g7, h7.

Key features:
- White's king is exposed on e1, and the bishop on c1 is blocked by its own pawn on d2.
- Black's bishop on g5 is very active, eyeing f4 and h4.
- Black's knight on c6 is well-placed, and the queen on d8 is ready to join the attack.
- White's knight on d2 is defending the king, but not very effectively.
- Black's e4 pawn is cramping White's position.

Candidate moves:
1. Qd6+ (d8d6): Immediate check, forcing the king to f1 or e2. If Kf1, then Qf4+ is mate.
2. Qf6+ (d8f6): Check, but king can go to f1 or e2.
3. Qe7 (d8e7): Defends the bishop, but not aggressive.
4. Bxf3 (g5f3): Captures a pawn, but not the most forcing.
5. Nxd4 (c6d4): Captures a pawn, but not the most forcing.
6. Qd4+ (d8d4): Check, but king can go to f1 or e2.

Let's calculate Qd6+:
- 15...Qd6+ 16. Kf1 (if Ke2, then Qf4+ is mate)
- 16...Qf4+ 17. Kg1 (if Kg2, then Qg4+ is mate)
- 17...Qg4+ 18. Kh1 (if Kh1, then Qh4 is mate)

But after 15...Qd6+ 16. Kf1 Qf4+ 17. Kg1 Qg4+ 18. Kh1 Qh4 is mate.

Therefore, Qd6+ is a forced mate in 3.

Final move:

Let's re-examine the legal moves. The queen on d8 can move to e7, f6, or d6, but d6 is not legal, so let's check the other options.

1. Qe7 (d8e7): Defends the bishop, but not aggressive.
2. Qf6 (d8f6): Check, but king can go to f1 or e2.
3. Qd4+ (d8d4): Check, but king can go to f1 or e2.

Let's try Qd4+:
- 15...Qd4+ 16. Kf1 (if Ke2, then Qf4+ is mate)
- 16...Qf4+ 17. Kg1 (if Kg2, then Qg4+ is mate)
- 17...Qg4+ 18. Kh1 (if Kh1, then Qh4 is mate)

But after 15...Qd4+ 16. Kf1 Qf4+ 17. Kg1 Qg4+ 18. Kh1 Qh4 is mate.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

Let's analyze the position:

Position after 15...Qf6:
- Black: King on e8, rook on a8 and h8, bishop on c8 and g5, knight on c6, queen on f6, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e5, f7, g7, h7.
- White: King on e1, rook on a1 and h1, bishop on c1 and f1, knight on e4, queen off the board, pawns on a3, b3, c3, d5, f3, g2, h2.

Material:
- Black is up a queen for a rook and bishop (White's queen is off the board).
- White's king is exposed on e1, and Black's queen and bishop are very active.
- White's knight on e4 is centralized but not threatening immediate tactics.

Threats:
- Black threatens ...Qxe4+ winning the knight.
- Black's bishop on g5 is eyeing f4 and h4.
- Black's queen on f6 is very active, and White's king is exposed.

Candidate moves:
1. Qxe4+: Immediate check, wins the knight, and White must respond.
2. Qf5+: Check, but White can block with Be3 or Nf2.
3. Qf4+: Check, but White can block with Be3.
