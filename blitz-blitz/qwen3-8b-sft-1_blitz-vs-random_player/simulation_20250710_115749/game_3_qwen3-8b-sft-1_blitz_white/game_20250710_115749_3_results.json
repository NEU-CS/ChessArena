Both sides have a full set of pawns and minor pieces. White has a knight on e5, which is well - placed, while Black has a knight on h6, which is somewhat passive.\n- **King Safety**: Both kings are relatively safe for now. White's king is still in the center, but it hasn't been exposed to any immediate threats.
