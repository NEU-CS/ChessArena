2025-07-10 13:34:12,915 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-1_blitz) (took 9.03s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.

Current position assessment:
- White has played d4, opening the center
- Black needs to respond to this central break
- The most common responses to d4 are e5, d5, or c5 (Sicilian Defense)
- We need to choose the best move that gives Black the best chances

Let me consider the candidate moves:

1. e5 (e7e5): This is the most common response, challenging White's center immediately
2. d5 (d7d5): This is the main line of the Queen's Gambit Declined
3. c5 (c7c5): This is the main line of the Sicilian Defense
4. f5 (f7f5): This is a less common but aggressive move

The Sicilian Defense (c5) is generally considered the most flexible and strongest response to d4. It gives Black good counterplay and development options.

Let me check if there are any immediate tactical threats:
- White has no immediate threats after c5
- Black can develop pieces naturally

The Sicilian Defense (c5) is the best move here as it:
1. Challenges White's center
2. Opens lines for Black's pieces
3. Gives Black good counterplay
4. Is a well-known and theoretically sound opening

2025-07-10 13:35:17,776 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-1_blitz) (took 17.73s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1. d4 c5 2. c3**

- White has played d4, c3, and Black has responded with c5.
- The position is slightly open in the center, and Black has a slight space advantage.
- White's c3 pawn is a bit awkward, and Black can consider playing d4 to challenge it.
- Black's options include:
  - **c5xd4**: Capturing the c3 pawn, but after cxd4, White can play Nf3, and Black's center is not fully developed.
  - **e7e5**: Developing the queen's knight and challenging the center, but White can play Nf3, and Black's center is still not fully developed.
  - **d7d5**: Developing the queen's knight and challenging the center, but White can play Nf3, and Black's center is still not fully developed.
  - **b7b6**: Preparing to develop the queen's knight to b6, but this is a bit slow.
  - **g8f6**: Developing the king's knight, but this is a bit slow.
  - **g8h6**: Developing the king's knight, but this is a bit slow.
  - **b8c6**: Developing the queen's knight, but this is a bit slow.
  - **d8c7**: Developing the queen, but this is a bit slow.
  - **d8b6**: Developing the queen, but this is a bit slow.
  - **d8a5**: Developing the queen, but this is a bit slow.
  - **h7h6**: Preparing to develop the king's bishop, but this is a bit slow.
  - **g7g6**: Preparing to develop the king's bishop, but this is a bit slow.
  - **f7f6**: Preparing to develop the king's bishop, but this is a bit slow.
  - **e7e6**: Preparing to develop the queen's bishop, but this is a bit slow.
  - **d7d6**: Preparing to develop the queen's bishop, but this is a bit slow.
  - **b7b5**: Preparing to develop the queen's bishop, but this is a bit slow.
  - **a7a6**: Preparing to develop the queen's bishop, but this is a bit slow.

**Best move:**
- The most natural move is to capture the c3 pawn with the d4 pawn, as it opens the center and gives Black a slight space advantage.
- After cxd4, White can play Nf3, and Black can continue developing.

**Final move:**
```

2025-07-10 13:36:20,579 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-1_blitz) (took 24.22s):
I need to analyze this position carefully. I'm playing as Black, and I have a few options to consider.

Current position assessment:
- White has played d2d4, c2c3, and c5d4, capturing my pawn
- My pawn on d4 is now on c3
- White has a queen on d2, which is quite active
- I have a pawn on d4 that's currently on c3

Let me consider my options:

1. **d4c3**: This would recapture White's pawn, but after d4c3, White can play Qxc3, and I'd be down a pawn with no compensation.

2. **d8c7**: This would develop my queen to a more active square, but it doesn't address the pawn on c3.

3. **b8c6**: Developing my knight to a natural square, but again, doesn't address the pawn issue.
