2025-06-26 17:00:03,996 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.54s):
Let's analyze the position:

White has played 1.e4, occupying the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop. As Black, we have a wide range of responses. Let's consider the main options:

**1...e5**: The classical response, directly contesting the center. Leads to open games (Ruy Lopez, Italian, etc.).
**1...c5**: The Sicilian Defense, aiming for asymmetrical pawn structures and dynamic play.
**1...e6**: The French Defense, solid but somewhat passive.
**1...c6**: The Caro-Kann Defense, solid and flexible.
**1...d6**: The Pirc Defense, flexible but allows White to build a strong center.
**1...d5**: The Scandinavian Defense, immediately challenging the center but can lead to early queen development.
**Other moves**: Less common, usually less effective at the top level.

Given the critical nature of the match and the need for both solidity and counterplay, the best move is often 1...c5 (Sicilian Defense) or 1...e5 (Open Game). Both are theoretically sound and offer Black good chances for equality and even counterplay.

**Let's briefly evaluate:**
- 1...e5: Classical, solid, no weaknesses, develops pieces naturally.
- 1...c5: Dynamic, unbalanced, many lines, but requires precise knowledge.

Given the need for utmost caution and the desire to avoid early pitfalls, 1...e5 is the most reliable and time-tested response.

My move:
```
e7e5

2025-06-26 17:00:54,418 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.41s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3**

- White has played the King's Pawn Opening and developed the knight to f3, attacking Black's e5 pawn.
- Black to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nc6** (b8c6): The most classical response, defending e5 and developing a piece.
2. **Nf6** (g8f6): The Petrov Defense, directly counterattacking e4.
3. **d6**: The Philidor Defense, solid but passive.
4. Other moves (developing bishop, queen, or other knight moves) are less principled here.

**Analysis:**
- **Nc6** is the main line, defending e5 and preparing to develop the bishop.
- **Nf6** is also playable, but after Nxe5, d6, White can play Nf3 or d4, leading to Petrov lines.
- **d6** is solid but blocks the c8 bishop and is less ambitious.
- Developing the bishop (Bc5, Bb4) before defending e5 allows Nxe5, losing a pawn.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is **Nc6** (b8c6), defending the e5 pawn, developing a piece, and maintaining flexibility.

2025-06-26 17:01:44,852 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.09s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4**

White has played the Scotch Game, immediately challenging the center. Black to move.

**Key points:**
- White threatens to capture on e5 (dxe5), attacking the knight on c6 and the pawn on e5.
- The main line is to capture on d4: e5xd4.
- Other moves (developing pieces, defending e5) are less common and may allow White to seize the initiative.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e5d4** (main line, best move): Accepts the Scotch, opening the center and challenging White's setup.
2. **exd4** is the most principled and direct response.
3. **Nxd4** (after exd4, White usually recaptures with Nxd4).
4. Other moves like Nf6, d6, or Bb4 are less accurate and allow White to gain an advantage.

**Tactical considerations:**
- If Black does not capture on d4, White will play d5 or dxe5, gaining space or material.
- Capturing on d4 keeps the game balanced and in mainline theory.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture on d4.

2025-06-26 17:02:40,758 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.67s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 4.Nd4:**

- White has developed both knights and has a strong center with pawns on c2, d4, and e4.
- Black has developed the queen's knight to c6, but no other pieces are developed yet.
- White's last move (Nd4) attacks the c6 knight and threatens to gain more space in the center.
- Black to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxd4**: Exchange knights. After Qxd4, White's queen is centralized, but Black can develop with tempo (e.g., ...Nf6, ...d6, ...Be7).
2. **Qf6**: Develops the queen, attacks d4, but exposes the queen early.
3. **Bc5**: Develops the bishop, attacks d4, but White can play Nxc6.
4. **Nf6**: Develops the knight, but White can play e5, attacking the knight.
5. **Bb4+**: Check, but White can block with c3 or Nc3.
6. **d5**: Strikes in the center, but White can play exd5, and after Qxd5, White can develop with tempo.

**Let's look at the main lines:**

- **4...Nxd4 5.Qxd4**: White's queen is centralized, but Black can play ...Nf6, ...d6, ...Be7, and castle. No immediate threats.
- **4...Nf6 5.e5 Nxe5 6.Qe2 Qe7 7.f4**: White gets a strong center and initiative.
- **4...Bc5 5.Nxc6 bxc6 6.Bc4**: White has a lead in development.
- **4...Bb4+ 5.c3 Ba5 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.Bc4**: White is ahead in development.

**Best move:**
- Exchanging knights with **Nxd4** is solid. It removes White's active knight and avoids giving White a lead in development. After Qxd4, Black can continue with ...Nf6, ...d6, ...Be7, and castle.

**Final move:**
```
c6d4

2025-06-26 17:03:27,091 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.74s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 5. Qd4:**
- White has developed the queen early to d4, attacking the g7 pawn and potentially eyeing the kingside.
- Black is behind in development but has no immediate threats to deal with.
- The queen on d4 can be attacked by Nc6 (but the knight is gone), or by c5, or by Qf6.
- Black's main priorities: develop pieces, avoid falling behind, and avoid tactical shots from the active white queen.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf6**: Develops a knight, attacks the queen, but allows e5 with tempo.
2. **Qf6**: Develops the queen, attacks the d4 queen and b2 pawn, but blocks the knight.
3. **d6**: Opens the bishop, but is passive.
4. **c5**: Attacks the queen, gains space, but weakens d6 and b5.
5. **Be7**: Develops, prepares to castle.
6. **Bb4+**: Checks, but White can block easily with c3 or Nc3.
7. **h6/g6**: Prevents Bg5 or Qxg7, but not urgent.

**Critical lines:**
- **c5**: If 5...c5 6. Qe5+ Qe7 7. Qxe7+ Bxe7, Black is fine, but White has the bishop pair.
- **Qf6**: 5...Qf6 6. e5 Qb6 7. Qxb6 axb6, White is slightly better.
- **Nf6**: 5...Nf6 6. e5 Qe7 7. Be2, White is better developed.
- **Bb4+**: 5...Bb4+ 6. c3 Bf8 (retreat) or Ba5, but White can develop easily.

**Best move:**
- **c5** is the most active, attacks the queen, and gains space. After 6. Qe5+ Qe7 7. Qxe7+ Bxe7, Black is solid and can develop easily. Alternatively, if White plays Qd3 or Qc3, Black can continue development.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-26 17:04:12,741 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.56s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White's queen is on e5, very active and centralized.
- Black's king is still in the center, and development is lagging.
- Black's light-squared bishop can develop to e7 or the knight to e7.
- The queen on d8 is attacked by the queen on e5.
- If Black plays d8e7, queens are traded, which relieves some pressure.
- If Black plays f8e7, the bishop blocks the queen's defense of the e8 square, but develops a piece.
- If Black plays g8e7, the knight develops and blocks the e-file, but doesn't challenge the queen.

Let's consider each move:

1. **d8e7**: Trades queens. After Qxe7+, Bxe7, Black is behind in development but the position is simplified. White has a slight lead in development, but Black is solid and can continue with Nf6, d6, and castle.

2. **f8e7**: Develops the bishop, but White can play Qxg7, winning a pawn and threatening Qxh8. This is very dangerous for Black.

3. **g8e7**: Develops the knight, but White can play Qxc5, winning a pawn, or Qg3, keeping the queen active.

Trading queens seems to be the safest option to relieve pressure and avoid immediate material loss or tactical threats.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d8e7
```

2025-06-26 17:04:46,656 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.33s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White's queen is on e7, having just captured Black's queen.
- Black to move, with three legal moves: e8e7 (king captures queen), g8e7 (knight captures queen), f8e7 (bishop captures queen).
- Material: White is up a queen for a knight, but Black can recapture immediately.
- King safety: The king is on e8, so capturing with the king would lose castling rights and expose the king. Capturing with the bishop or knight keeps castling rights.
- Piece development: The knight on g8 is undeveloped; capturing with it develops a piece and keeps the king safe. The bishop on f8 is also undeveloped; capturing with it develops the bishop, but the knight is still on g8.
- Long-term: Keeping the king safe is paramount, and developing pieces is important.

Let's consider each recapture:

1. **e8e7 (king captures queen):**
   - Loses castling rights.
   - King is exposed in the center.
   - Not ideal.

2. **g8e7 (knight captures queen):**
   - Develops the knight to e7.
   - Keeps castling rights.
   - King remains safe.
   - Good for development.

3. **f8e7 (bishop captures queen):**
   - Develops the bishop to e7.
   - Keeps castling rights.
   - Knight remains undeveloped on g8.
   - Slightly less flexible than knight capture, as the knight on g8 still needs to be developed.

Between knight and bishop recapture, both are fine, but knight recapture is slightly preferable because it develops the knight to a central square and keeps the bishop flexible for future development (perhaps to b4 or g4).

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8e7
```

2025-06-26 17:05:22,561 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 8.Nc3:**
- White: King on e1, rook on a1 and f1, bishop on c1 and f1, knight on c3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, rook on a8 and h8, bishop on c8 and f8, knight is off the board, queen is off the board, pawns on a7, b7, c5, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7.

**Material:**
- Both sides have lost a queen and a knight.
- Black is to move.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- White has a slight lead in development (knight on c3, central pawn on e4).
- Black's king is still in the center, but can castle queenside or kingside.
- No immediate threats from White, but Black should develop and castle soon.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **h8g8** (castle kingside): Safe, but bishop on f8 is blocked.
2. **e8d8** (castle queenside): Safe, but queenside pawns are undeveloped.
3. **e7g8** (move king to g8): Not castling, just moving the king.
4. **e7g6** (move king to g6): Unsafe, exposes king.
5. **e7c6** (move king to c6): Unsafe, exposes king.
6. **e7f5** (move king to f5): Unsafe, exposes king.
7. **e7d5** (move king to d5): Unsafe, exposes king.
8. **h7h6** (pawn move): Prepares to develop bishop, but slow.
9. **g7g6** (pawn move): Prepares to fianchetto bishop, but slow.
10. **f7f6** (pawn move): Weakens e6, not recommended.
11. **d7d6** (pawn move): Opens bishop, supports c5.
12. **b7b6** (pawn move): Prepares to develop bishop, but slow.
13. **a7a6** (pawn move): Slow.
14. **c5c4** (pawn move): Gains space, but gives up d4 square.
15. **h7h5, g7g5, f7f5, d7d5, b7b5, a7a5**: All pawn pushes, but not urgent.

**Best Move:**
- **d7d6** is strong: develops bishop, supports c5, prepares to castle.
- **h8g8** is also good, but bishop on f8 is blocked.
- **e8d8** (castle queenside) is possible, but queenside pawns are undeveloped.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is **d7d6**, opening lines for the bishop and preparing to castle.

2025-06-26 17:06:01,064 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.81s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b1kb1r/pp2nppp/3p4/1Np5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 9

- White's knight is on b5, exerting pressure on d6 and c7.
- Black's king is still in the center, and the e7 knight is awkward.
- Black's c8 bishop is undeveloped.
- White's position is active, but Black is not under immediate threat.
- Black's d6 pawn is under attack by the knight on b5.
- Black's c5 pawn is controlling d4 and b4.
- White's kingside is undeveloped, but so is Black's.

**Critical points:**
- The d6 pawn is attacked and only defended by the queen.
- If White plays Nc7+, it forks the king and rook, so we must prevent that.
- The e7 knight is blocking the bishop and the king's castling.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a7a6**: Attacks the knight on b5, forcing it to move or exchange.
2. **c8d7**: Develops the bishop, defends the knight on e7, and prepares to castle queenside.
3. **c8e6**: Develops the bishop, attacks the knight on b5, but leaves d6 weak.
4. **d6d5**: Pushes the pawn, but after exd5, the knight on b5 can jump to c7+.
5. **a8b8**: Prepares to defend b7, but is passive.
6. **e7g6**: Moves the knight, but doesn't address the threat on d6.
7. **h8g8**: Castles, but the king is still exposed and d6 is weak.

**Key tactical threat:** Nc7+ forking king and rook.

**Best move:** The most urgent threat is Nc7+, so we must address it. The move **a7a6** attacks the knight, forcing it to move. If White plays Nxd6+, Black can play Qxd6, and the threat is neutralized. If White retreats the knight, Black can develop comfortably.

**Final move:**
```
a7a6

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b1kb1r/1pN1nppp/p2p4/2p5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 10

**Black to move. Legal moves:** e8d8, e8d7

**Position assessment:**
- White has a knight on c7, attacking the rook on a8 and threatening to capture on a8.
- Black's king is on e8, and the only legal moves are to move the king to d8 or d7.
- If the king moves to d8, White can play Nxa8, winning the exchange (rook for knight).
- If the king moves to d7, White can also play Nxa8.

There is no way to save the rook on a8. The only question is which king move is better: e8d8 or e8d7.

**Comparing the two moves:**
- **e8d8:** After this, White will play Nxa8. Black can try to develop and perhaps trap the knight later, but for now, White is up the exchange.
- **e8d7:** After this, White will also play Nxa8. The king is on d7, which blocks the queen's development and is more exposed.

**Conclusion:** e8d8 is the safer square for the king, as it keeps the king closer to the back rank and allows for potential development of the queen and bishop. e8d7 unnecessarily exposes the king and blocks the queen.

**Final move:**
```
e8d8
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 10...**
- White: King on e1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c1 and f1, Knight on a8, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on d8, Queen is off the board, Rooks on h8, Bishops on c8 and f8, Knight on e7, pawns on a6, b7, c5, d6, f7, g7, h7.

**Key features:**
- White has a knight on a8, which is awkwardly placed and not participating.
- Black is down material (queen for knight), but White's coordination is poor.
- Black's king is on d8, not yet castled.
- Black's minor pieces are undeveloped but can be activated.
- White's king is still on e1, not castled, and White's queenside is undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c8e6**: Develops the bishop, attacks the a2 pawn, and prepares to castle queenside.
2. **c8f5**: Develops the bishop, attacks e4, and eyes c2.
3. **e7g6**: Knight to g6, possibly targeting f4 and supporting e5.
4. **d8e8**: Prepares to castle queenside.
5. **h8g8**: Prepares to castle kingside.
6. **d6d5**: Strikes in the center, but White can respond with exd5.
7. **b7b5**: Expands on the queenside, but may be premature.

**Strategic considerations:**
- Black needs to develop quickly and coordinate pieces.
- White's knight on a8 is out of play for several moves.
- Black should aim to castle and bring rooks to the center.
- The bishop on c8 should be developed to an active square.

**Best move:**
- **c8e6** stands out: develops, attacks a2, and prepares to castle queenside. If White plays b3, then Nc6 and Black is fully developed. If White tries to develop, Black can castle and bring rooks to the center.

**Final move:**
```
c8e6

2025-06-26 17:08:31,996 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 18.72s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 11... Be6:**
- Black: King on d8, bishop on f8 and e6, knight on e7, pawns on a6, b7, c5, d6, f7, g7, h7, rook on h8.
- White: King on e1, rook on a1 and f1, bishop on c1 and f1, knight gone (was on b6), pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.

**White's last move:** Nb6 (from c7), attacking the bishop on e6 and pawn on d6.

**Black to move.**

**Threats:**
- White is attacking the bishop on e6 with the knight on b6.
- White is also eyeing the d6 pawn (though not directly attacked yet).
- Black's king is on d8, so needs to be careful about safety.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Move the bishop (e.g., Be6-c8, Be6-d7, Be6-f5, Be6-d5, etc.).
2. Defend the bishop (not possible, as no pawn or piece can defend e6).
3. Exchange on a2 (Be6xa2) or b3 (Be6-b3), but those squares are not occupied by enemy pieces.
4. Play d6-d5, but that leaves the bishop on e6 hanging.
5. Play Nc8, defending the bishop, but the knight is on e7, so Nc8 is not possible.
6. Play f7-f6 to defend e5, but that's not relevant now.

**Best move:**
- The bishop on e6 is attacked by the knight on b6. If we move the bishop, where should it go?
- Be6-c8: Retreats the bishop, but blocks the rook on h8 and is passive.
- Be6-d7: Keeps the bishop active, but after Nxa8, White wins the exchange.
- Be6-f5: Active, attacks e4, but after exf5, Nxf5, White still wins the exchange.
- Be6-d5: Centralizes, but after exd5, Nxd5, White can play Nxa8.
- Be6-g4: Attacks the rook on d1, but there is no rook on d1.
- Be6-c4: Attacks the pawn on c2, but White can defend.

But wait: The knight on b6 is attacking the bishop on e6 and also threatening Nxa8, winning the exchange. If we move the bishop, White will play Nxa8, winning the rook for the knight.

Is there a way to trap the knight on a8 after it takes the rook? Let's check:

If 12... Be6-d7, 13. Nxa8, then ...Nc8 traps the knight, but the knight can escape via b6 or b8.

Alternatively, what about 12... Nc8? That defends the rook on a8 and the bishop on e6.

2025-06-26 17:08:39,670 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.67s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3k1b1r/1p2nppp/pN1pb3/2p5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 2 12

**Black to move.**

- White's knight on b6 attacks the bishop on e6 and threatens Nxa8 (winning the rook).
- If the bishop moves, White can play Nxa8.
- Is there a way to trap the knight after Nxa8? Let's check.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Be6-d7**: If 13.Nxa8, then Nc8 traps the knight. But White can play Nb6 and escape.
2. **Be6-c8**: Retreats the bishop, but White still plays Nxa8.
3. **Be6-f5**: If 13.exf5, Nxf5, White still plays Nxa8.
4. **d6-d5**: If 13.exd5, Nxd5, White still plays Nxa8.
5. **a6-a5**: If 13.Nxa8, Nc8, White can play b3 and the knight is still trapped, but Black can't easily win it.

**What about defending the bishop?**
- The only piece that could defend is the knight, but it can't reach c8 or d5 in one move.

**What about counterplay?**
- If Black plays Nc8 (not possible), or tries to create threats elsewhere.

**What about castling?**
- Not possible, as the king is on d8.

**What about h8-g8 (rook move)?**
- Not relevant to the current threat.

**Best move:**
- The bishop on e6 is attacked and will be lost if not moved.
- The best practical move is to move the bishop to a square where it is active and creates threats.

**Be6-g4**: This attacks the rook on d1, but there is no rook on d1.
**Be6-c4**: Attacks the pawn on c2, but White can defend.

**Be6-d7**: This is the most solid move, keeping the bishop active and preparing to meet Nxa8 with Nc8, trapping the knight.

**Let's calculate:**
12... Be6-d7
13. Nxa8 Nc8
Now the knight on a8 is trapped. White can try b3, but after cxb3, axb3, the knight is still trapped.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e6d7
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3k1b1r/1p1Nnppp/p2p4/2p5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 13

**Material:**
- Black: King (d8), Bishop (f8), Knight (e7), pawns (a6, b7, c5, d6, f7, g7, h7), rook (h8)
- White: King (e1), Bishop (c1), Knight (d7), pawns (a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2), rook (a1), bishop (f1)

**White's knight on d7 is very strong, controlling key squares and threatening to invade.**
**Black's king is a bit exposed, but White has no immediate threats.**
**Black's bishop on f8 is blocked but can be developed.**
**Black's knight on e7 is defending, but also can be repositioned.**

**Candidate moves:**
- h8g8: Develop rook to open file, but not urgent.
- d8e8, d8c8: King moves, but not necessary.
- e7g8: Retreat knight, but not ideal.
- e7c8: Retreat knight, but passive.
- e7g6: Knight to g6, attacks e5, but White has no pawn on e5.
- e7c6: Knight to c6, attacks d4, but White has no pawn on d4.
- e7f5: Knight to f5, attacks d4 and g3, but White has no pawn on d4.
- e7d5: Knight to d5, attacks b4 and f4, but White has no pawn on those squares.
- h7h6: Pawn move, creates luft.
- g7g6: Pawn move, creates luft.
- f7f6: Pawn move, blocks bishop.
- b7b6: Pawn move, supports c5.
- d6d5: Pawn move, challenges center.
- a6a5: Pawn move, not urgent.
- c5c4: Pawn move, gains space.
- h7h5: Pawn move, not urgent.
- g7g5: Pawn move, not urgent.
- f7f5: Pawn move, not urgent.
- b7b5: Pawn move, not urgent.

**Key considerations:**
- White's knight on d7 is very powerful and threatens to jump to b6 or f6.
- Black's king is on d8, so safety is a concern.
- Black's bishop on f8 is undeveloped.
- Black's rook on h8 is not active.

**Critical candidate moves:**
1. **d6d5**: Challenges White's center, opens lines for the bishop, and contests the center. If exd5, then Nxd5, and Black's pieces become more active.
2. **h8g8**: Develops rook, but not urgent.
3. **g7g6**: Creates luft, but not urgent.
4. **b7b6**: Supports c5, but not urgent.

**Let's calculate d6d5:**
- d6d5
  - exd5 Nxd5 (knight is now active, attacks c3, f4)
  - If White plays Nxf8, Rxf8, Black has the bishop pair and open f-file.
  - If White plays Bd2, Black can continue with Kxd7 or Bc6.

**Is there any immediate threat from White?**
- Nxf8 is possible, but after Rxf8, Black is fine.
- White can try to play Bf4, but Black can respond with Nxf4.

**d6d5** seems to be the most principled move, challenging the center and opening lines for Black's pieces.

**Final move:**
```
d6d5
```

2025-06-26 17:10:16,287 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.78s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3k1N1r/1p2nppp/p7/2pp4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 14

- Black to move.
- White's knight on f8 is very strong, attacking e6, g6, and d7 squares.
- Black's king is on d8, not very safe.
- Black's rook is on h8.
- Black's knight is on e7.
- Black's pawns: a6, b7, c5, d5, g7, h7, f7.
- White's bishop on c1, king on e1, rook on a1, bishop on f1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.

**Immediate threats:**
- White's knight on f8 is threatening to jump to e6 or g6, forking or attacking key squares.
- White has a potential to castle queenside or kingside.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h8g8** (Rook to g8): Defends the g7 pawn, but doesn't address the knight.
2. **h8f8** (Rook to f8): Attacks the knight on f8, forcing it to move or be exchanged.
3. **d8e8** (King to e8): Centralizes the king, but doesn't solve the knight issue.
4. **e7g8** (Knight to g8): Attacks the knight on f8, but White can exchange knights.
5. **d5e4** (Pawn takes e4): Grabs a central pawn, but leaves the king exposed.
6. **h7h6** (Pawn to h6): Gives luft, but not urgent.

**Critical analysis:**
- The knight on f8 is a thorn. If we play **h8f8**, we attack the knight and force White to react. If White exchanges, Black recaptures with the rook, and the pressure is relieved.
- If White doesn't exchange, the knight must move, and Black can develop further.
- **d5e4** is tempting, but after Nxe6+ or Ng6+, Black's king is exposed.
- **e7g8** is possible, but after Nxh7, White wins a pawn and keeps pressure.

**Best move:**
- **h8f8** is the most logical, attacking the knight and forcing White to decide. If Nxh7, then Rh8, and the knight is trapped. If Nxe6+, fxe6, and the knight is gone.

**Final move:**
```
h8f8
```

2025-06-26 17:10:55,906 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.38s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 15... (Black to move):**
- Material: Equal (both sides have all major/minor pieces except for a pair of knights exchanged).
- White: King on e1, rook on a1, bishop on c1, bishop on f1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on d8, rook on f8, knight on e7, pawns on a6, b7, c5, d5, f7, g7, h7.

**Key points:**
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on d8, but not under immediate threat.
- Black's knight on e7 is well-placed, controlling key central squares.
- Black's pawn structure is solid.
- White has not developed kingside pieces or castled yet.
- Black's rook on f8 is on an open file, but not yet active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7g8** (knight to g8): Retreats the knight, but doesn't achieve much.
2. **e7c8** (knight to c8): Retreats the knight, but not active.
3. **e7g6** (knight to g6): Puts pressure on e5 and f4, but White can play d3 and develop.
4. **e7c6** (knight to c6): Centralizes the knight, supports d4, and eyes b4 and e5.
5. **e7f5** (knight to f5): Attacks d4, but White can play g3.
6. **e7d5** (knight to d5): Occupies a strong central square, attacks c3, e3, and f4.
7. **d8e8** (king to e8): Retreats the king, but not necessary.
8. **f8h8, f8g8, f8e8** (rook moves): Not urgent, as the rook is not under threat.
9. **Pawn moves**: h7-h6, g7-g6, f7-f6, b7-b6, a6-a5, c5-c4, h7-h5, g7-g5, f7-f5, b7-b5.

**Best candidate:**
- **e7d5** (knight to d5): This move centralizes the knight, blocks the d-file, and prepares to support c3 or e3 squares. It also keeps the king relatively safe and maintains pressure.

**Alternative:**
- **e7c6** is also strong, but d5 is more active and central.

**Final move:**
```
e7d5
```

2025-06-26 17:11:57,207 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.79s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3k1r2/1p3ppp/p7/2pn4/8/4B3/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 16

**Black to move.**

**Material:** Equal (both sides have all pieces except queens and one pair of rooks; Black has bishop pair, White has bishop and knight).

**Position:**
- Black's king is on d8, rook on f8, pawns on a6, b7, c5, d5, f7, g7, h7.
- White's king on e1, rook on a1, bishop on e3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- White has castling rights (KQ), Black does not.

**Key points:**
- Black's pieces are centralized, but the king is somewhat exposed.
- White's bishop on e3 is well-placed, eyeing c5 and d4.
- Black has a space advantage on the queenside and center.
- No immediate tactics, but Black can try to press on the queenside or centralize further.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...c5c4 (gain space, attack bishop)
2. ...d5e3 (exchange bishop, but gives up central control)
3. ...d5c3 (attack bishop, but bishop can move)
4. ...f8e8 (centralize rook)
5. ...h7h6 (prevent Bg5)
6. ...b7b6 (solidify c5 pawn)
7. ...a6a5 (gain space)
8. ...g7g6 (solidify kingside)

**Analysis:**

- ...c5c4: Attacks the bishop, forces it to move. If Bxc5, then Re8+ and Black can get some activity. If Be2, then Black has gained space.
- ...f8e8: Centralizes rook, but not urgent.
- ...d5e3: Trades bishop, but White recaptures with f-pawn, opening the f-file for White's rook.
- ...h7h6: Prevents Bg5, but not urgent.
- ...b7b6: Solidifies c5, but not necessary yet.

**Best move:**
- ...c5c4 is the most active, gaining space and forcing White's bishop to decide. It also prepares to expand on the queenside and possibly play ...c3 in the future.

**Final move:**
```
c5c4
```

2025-06-26 17:12:59,977 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.24s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on d8, Rook on f8, pawns on a6, b7, c4, d5, g7, h7
- White: King on c1, Rook on h1, Bishop on e3 and f1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2

**Position:**
- Black is up a pawn (6 vs 5).
- White has the bishop pair, but Black's pawn structure is solid and the c4 pawn is advanced.
- Black's king is centralized but not under immediate threat.
- White's pieces are a bit passive; the rook on h1 and bishop on f1 are not active yet.
- Black's rook is on f8, can be activated.
- Black has a passed c-pawn (c4), which can be pushed.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f8e8**: Centralizes the rook, supports e-file, and keeps options open.
2. **f8g8**: Prepares to double rooks on the g-file or defend the g7 pawn.
3. **f8h8**: Rook to h8, but not very active.
4. **d8c8**: King to c8, possibly to support the c-pawn, but may walk into a pin after Rd1.
5. **c4c3**: Pushes the passed pawn, but White can play b3 and block it.
6. **a6a5**: Expands on the queenside, but not urgent.
7. **h7h6**: Gives luft, but not urgent.
8. **d8e7**: King to e7, centralizes, but could be exposed.

**Deeper analysis:**
- **c4c3**: If 17...c4-c3, then 18.b3 blocks, and Black can't push further. Not immediately effective.
- **f8e8**: Rook to e8, centralizes, and prepares to contest the e-file. If White plays Bxc4, Black can play Nxe3, but there is no knight on the board. (Correction: There is no knight, so this is not a concern.)
- **f8g8**: Rook to g8, but White has no immediate threats on the kingside.
- **d8c8**: King to c8, but White can play Rd1, pinning the king to the rook.

**Best move:**
- **f8e8** is the most flexible, centralizes the rook, and prepares to contest the e-file if White plays Rd1. It also keeps the rook active and supports potential e-file operations.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f8e8
```

2025-06-26 17:15:00,707 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.42s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Rd5):**
- Black to move.
- Material: Black is down an exchange (rook for bishop), but has a pawn for it.
- White's pieces are very active: Rd5 is on the 5th, Be3 and Bf1 are well placed, and White's king is safe on c1.
- Black's king is on e8, and the only rook is on h8. Black's bishop is gone.
- Black's pawn structure: a6, b7, c4, f7, g7, h7. White has pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black's c4 pawn is advanced but isolated.
- White threatens to double rooks on the d-file or invade the 7th rank.

**Legal moves:**
- d8c8 (move the king to c8)
- d8e7 (move the king to e7)
- d8c7 (move the king to c7)

**Analysis:**
- d8c8: King to c8. This move steps off the open d-file and prepares to bring the rook to d8, contesting the file. However, after Rc5+ Kb8 (only move), Bf4+ Ka7, Be3, White can continue to press.
- d8e7: King to e7. This move keeps the king more centralized but on the open file, and White can play Bc5+ or Re5+.
- d8c7: King to c7. This move is risky, as the king is exposed on the c-file and can be harassed by White's pieces.

**Best move:**
- d8c8 is the safest. It gets the king off the open file and prepares to contest the d-file with the rook. The king is safer on the queenside, and Black can try to activate the rook via d8 or h8.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d8c8

2025-06-26 17:16:42,136 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.88s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- White: King on c1, rook on d5 and h1, bishop on c4 and e3, pawns on b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on c8, rook on e8, pawns on a6, b7, f7, g7, h7.

**Material:**
- Both sides have equal material, but White has two bishops and active rooks.
- Black's king is on c8, rook on e8, and pawns are mostly on their original squares except a6.

**Threats:**
- White is threatening to double rooks on the d-file, possibly Rd1 next, or Rd7, putting pressure on b7 and f7.
- White's bishops are very active, especially the one on c4, which eyes f7 and a6.
- Black's king is relatively safe for now, but White's pieces are much more active.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **e8e7**: Defends the b7 pawn and prepares to double rooks on the d-file.
2. **e8d8**: Defends the d7 square, but blocks the king's escape.
3. **c8b8**: Moves the king off the c-file, but doesn't solve the activity issue.
4. **h7h6**: Luft for the king, but not urgent.
5. **a6a5**: Gains space, but doesn't solve the main problems.
6. **e8e4**: Offers a rook trade, but White can decline and keep pressure.
7. **e8h8**: Rook to h8, but not active.
8. **e8g8**: Rook to g8, but not active.

**Deeper Analysis:**
- If 1...e8e7, White can play Rd1, doubling rooks, but Black can then play Kc7 and try to defend.
- If 1...e8e4, White can play Bd3, keeping the pressure.
- If 1...e8d8, White can play Rxd8+ Kxd8, and then Bxf7, winning a pawn.

**Best Move:**
- **e8e7** is the most solid, defending b7 and preparing to meet Rd1 with Kc7, keeping the rook active and defending the 7th rank.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e8e7
```

2025-06-26 17:17:28,630 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 15.77s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/1p2rppp/p7/3R4/2B5/4B3/PPP2PPP/2KR4 b - - 2 20

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), Rook (e7), pawns (a6, b7, f7, g7, h7)
- White: King (c1), Rook (d5), Bishop (c4, e3), pawns (a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2)

**White's threats:**
- White is very active, with both bishops and a rook on the 5th rank. 
- Immediate threats: White may double rooks on the d-file or invade the 7th rank.
- No immediate mate threat, but Black's king is a bit exposed.

**Black's plans:**
- Defend the 7th rank, avoid tactical shots.
- Consider activating the rook, possibly via e4 or e6.
- Consider pawn breaks to create counterplay, but only if safe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7e8** (Rook to e8): Passive, but keeps the rook on the back rank.
2. **e7e6** (Rook to e6): Attacks the bishop on e3, but White can play Rd8+ and after Kc7, Bxe6 fxe6, White is better.
3. **e7e5** (Rook to e5): Attacks the bishop on e3, but White can play Rd8+ Kc7, Bf4 and Black is under pressure.
4. **e7c7** (Rook to c7): Defends the 7th rank, but White can play Rd8+ Kxd8 Bb6+ Ke7 Bxc7, winning material.
5. **c8b8** (King to b8): Sidesteps, but doesn't address White's pressure.
6. **h7h6** (Pawn move): Luft, but slow.
7. **a6a5** (Pawn move): Not urgent.
8. **b7b5** (Pawn move): Not possible, as b7 is blocked by a pawn.

**Tactical checks:**
- After e7e6, White can play Rd8+ Kc7, Bxe6 fxe6, Bf4+ Kc6, and White is better.
- After e7e5, White can play Rd8+ Kc7, Bf4, and Black is under pressure.
- After e7e8, White can play Bf4, and Black is still passive but not losing.

**Best move:**
- The safest move is to bring the rook back to the 8th rank to defend against Rd8+ and keep the king safe. e7e8 is solid, as it covers the 8th rank and doesn't allow White to invade.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e7e8
```

- Black's pawn structure is intact, but White's pressure is significant.
- The c5-c4, e3-b6 sequence means White has a bishop on b6, which is very strong, pinning the c7 pawn and controlling key squares.
- White's rook on d5 and bishop on c4 are also very active.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed, and White threatens to double rooks on the d-file or invade on d8.
- Black's rook on e8 is the only piece defending the back rank.

**Immediate threats:**
- White threatens to play Rd8+, which would force Kb8, then Bxf7, winning material or possibly mating.
- White's control of the d-file is overwhelming.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e8e1+**: Check, but after Rxe1, nothing is achieved.
2. **e8d8**: Offers a rook trade, but after Rxd8+ Kxd8, White is still much better, but at least the pressure is relieved.
3. **c8b8**: Moves the king, but then Rd8+ wins the rook on e8.
4. **e8h8**: Retreats the rook, but then Rd8+ forces Kc7, and White can pile up on d7.
5. **a6a5**: Not relevant, doesn't address the threats.
6. **h7h6, g7g6, f7f6**: Pawn moves, but do not address the immediate threat.
7. **e8g8, e8f8**: Lateral rook moves, but after Rd8+ Kc7, White is still winning.

**Best defense:**
- The only move that avoids immediate disaster is to trade rooks with **e8d8**. After Rxd8+ Kxd8, White is still much better due to the bishop pair and active pieces, but at least Black avoids immediate loss.

**Final move:**
```
e8d8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
