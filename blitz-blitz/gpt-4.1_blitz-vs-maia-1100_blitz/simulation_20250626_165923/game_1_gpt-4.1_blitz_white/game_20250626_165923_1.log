2025-06-26 16:59:42,200 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 4.69s):
Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of chess. As White, I have the first move. The main goals are to control the center, develop pieces, and prepare for king safety (castling).

Candidate moves:
1. e2e4 – Opens lines for the queen and bishop, controls the center.
2. d2d4 – Also controls the center, opens lines for the bishop and queen.
3. c2c4 – English Opening, controls the center from the flank.
4. g1f3 – Develops a knight, controls the center.
5. b1c3 – Develops a knight, but less central than Nf3.

Of these, 1.e4 and 1.d4 are the most popular and strongest opening moves. Both control the center and allow for rapid development.

Between e4 and d4, e4 is slightly more aggressive and leads to open games, which can be advantageous if I want to press for a win.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e2e4
```

2025-06-26 17:00:32,055 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 4.78s):
Let's analyze the position:

1. e4 c5

This is the Sicilian Defense, a very popular and sharp opening. As White, I have a wide range of options. The main lines are:
- 2. Nf3 (developing and attacking the e5 square, most popular)
- 2. Nc3 (Closed Sicilian)
- 2. d4 (Smith-Morra Gambit)
- 2. c3 (Alapin Variation)

Let's consider the main move 2. Nf3:
- Develops a piece, attacks the e5 square, prepares for d4.

Other options:
- 2. Nc3: more positional, less direct.
- 2. d4: immediate central challenge, but usually played after Nf3.
- 2. c3: Alapin, aiming for d4 without allowing ...Nc6 pressure.

Given the critical nature of the match and the need to play for advantage, the main line 2. Nf3 is the best. It keeps all options open, develops a piece, and puts pressure on Black.

Final move:
```
g1f3
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3

**Move history:** 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6

**It's White to move.**

**Position assessment:**
- Black has played a standard Sicilian Defense setup.
- White has a strong center and good development potential.
- No immediate threats from Black.
- White can develop pieces naturally or strike in the center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d2d4**: Immediate central break, challenging Black's c5 pawn and opening lines for development.
2. **b1c3**: Develops the queen's knight, supports the center, and prepares for d4.
3. **f1c4**: Develops the bishop to an active square, eyes f7.
4. **f1b5+**: Check, but Black can easily block with Bd7 or Nc6.
5. **d2d3**: Solid, but less ambitious than d4.
6. **e4e5**: Gains space, but Black can respond with dxe5 or Nc6.

**Deeper analysis:**
- **d2d4** is principled in the Open Sicilian, aiming for central control and rapid development. After cxd4 Nxd4, White has a lead in development and central presence.
- **b1c3** is also good, but less ambitious than d4.
- **f1c4** develops a piece, but doesn't contest the center immediately.
- **f1b5+** is not very effective here.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is **d2d4**, striking in the center and following mainline Sicilian theory.

My move:
```
d2d4

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4

**Move history:** 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4

**Current position:**
- Black has just captured on d4 with the c-pawn.
- White's knight is on f3, and the e4 pawn is attacked by the d4 pawn.
- White to move.

**Key points:**
- The e4 pawn is under attack, but White can recapture on d4 with the knight.
- Recapturing with the knight develops a piece and keeps the center under control.
- Other moves (like e5 or c3) are less direct and may allow Black to consolidate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf3xd4**: Recaptures the pawn, develops the knight to a strong central square, and maintains material equality.
2. **e4-e5**: Advances the pawn, but Black can respond with dxe5, and White loses a central pawn.
3. **c2-c3**: Prepares to recapture with the pawn, but allows Black to play dxc3, and White's pawn structure is compromised.
4. **Other knight moves (Nf3-g5, Nf3-e5, etc.)**: Do not address the central tension and lose a pawn.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to recapture the pawn with the knight, maintaining central control and development.

My move:
```
f3d4

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5

**White to move.**

**Material:** Equal.

**Position:**
- Black's knight is on f6, bishop on f8, queen on d8, bishop on c8, pawns on d6, e7, f7, g7, h7, a7, b7, rook on a8, h8, king on e8.
- White's knight is on d4, bishop on f1, queen on d1, bishop on c1, pawns on e4, c2, b2, a2, f2, g2, h2, rook on a1, h1, king on e1.

**Key features:**
- White has a strong center and more space.
- Black's development is behind; kingside bishop and king are still on their original squares.
- White's knight on d4 is well-placed.
- No immediate threats from Black.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nc3** (develops, supports d5, prepares to castle)
2. **Bb5+** (checks, but Black can block easily with Bd7 or Nbd7)
3. **Bd3** (develops, eyes h7, supports e4)
4. **Be2** (prepares to castle)
5. **f3** (supports e4, but unnecessary now)
6. **e5** (gains space, attacks knight, but can be met with dxe5)
7. **Nc6** (Nd4-c6) (attacks b8 rook, but Black can play Nxc6)
8. **Nf5** (Nd4-f5) (attacks g7, but Black can play e6)
9. **Qf3** (develops queen, eyes b7 and f7, but premature)
10. **h3** (prevents Bg4, but slow)

**Deeper analysis:**
- **Nc3** is a standard developing move, supports the center, and keeps options open.
- **Bb5+** is tempting, but after Bd7, White has to decide whether to exchange or retreat. Not much gained.
- **e5**: If 5.e5 dxe5 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.Bxd7+ Nbxd7, White has some initiative, but Black is not in trouble.
- **Bd3**: Develops, eyes kingside, supports e4, and prepares to castle. Solid.
- **Nf5**: 5.Nf5 e6 6.Ng3, not much achieved.
- **Nc6**: 5.Nc6 Nxc6 6.Nxc6 bxc6, Black has doubled pawns but open b-file.

**Best move:**
- **Nc3** is the most natural, developing move. It supports e4, prepares for Be2/Bd3 and castling, and keeps all options open. It also prevents ...Nc6 by Black.

**Final move:**
```
b1c3

2025-06-26 17:03:46,543 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.87s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 5...g6:**
- Black has fianchettoed the kingside bishop, aiming for a solid setup.
- White has a strong center and more space.
- White's pieces are well-developed, with both knights out and central control.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped, and the king is still in the center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c1g5** (Bishop to g5): Pins the knight on f6, increases pressure on d5 and f6, and develops a piece.
2. **f1c4** (Bishop to c4): Targets f7 and puts pressure on the center, develops a piece.
3. **d1d2** (Queen to d2): Prepares for long castling, but not urgent yet.
4. **e4e5** (Pawn to e5): Gains space, attacks the knight, but might be premature as Black can play dxe5 and after Nf3, Qxd1+.
5. **h2h3**: Prevents ...Bg4, but not urgent.
6. **d4b3**: Retreats the knight, but unnecessary.

**Best move:**
- Developing the dark-squared bishop is natural and increases pressure. Both Bg5 and Bc4 are good, but Bg5 is more forcing, pins the knight, and can provoke weaknesses or exchanges favorable for White.

**Tactical check:**
- After Bg5, if ...Bg7, White can consider Qd2 and long castling, with a kingside attack.
- No immediate tactics for Black.

**Final move:**
```
c1g5

2025-06-26 17:04:38,591 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.55s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 6...Bg7:**

- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishops on g5 and f1, Knights on c3 and d4, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d4, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishops on g7 and c8, Knights on b8 and f6, pawns on a7, b7, d6, e7, f7, g6, h7.

**Key features:**
- White has more space and better development.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped.
- White's bishop on g5 is pinning the knight on f6.
- White's knight on d4 is centralized.
- White can consider e4-e5, increasing pressure on f6 and opening lines.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e4-e5**: Attacks the pinned knight on f6, threatens to open the center, and takes advantage of Black's lack of development.
2. **Qd2**: Prepares to castle queenside and possibly Bh6.
3. **Ndb5**: Attacks d6 and c7, but Black can play a6.
4. **Bxf6**: Exchanges on f6, but this helps Black develop.
5. **h3**: A waiting move, but not urgent.
6. **Nxc6**: Trades on c6, but helps Black develop.

**Tactical considerations:**
- After e4-e5, if dxe5, Ndb5 is very strong, threatening Nc7+.
- If Black ignores e5, White can play exf6, Bxf6, and then Nd5, increasing pressure.

**Let's calculate e4-e5:**
- 7. e5 dxe5 (forced, otherwise e5-e6 is strong)
- 8. Ndb5 (threatening Nc7+ and d6)
- If Qxd1+, Rxd1, Na6, White can play Nd5, with strong pressure.

**Is there any immediate tactic with Ndb5?**
- 7. Ndb5 a6 8. Na3 (not great), or 8. Nd4 (returns).

**Is Bxf6 good?**
- 7. Bxf6 Bxf6 8. Nd5 (attacks f6 and c7, but Black can play Bg7).

**Is Qd2 good?**
- 7. Qd2 O-O 8. O-O-O, but Black can play Nc6.

**Conclusion:**
**e4-e5** is the most aggressive and principled move, taking advantage of the pin and Black's lack of development.

My move:
```
e4e5
```

2025-06-26 17:05:51,427 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 11.03s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 7...e5:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishops on f1 and g5, Knights on c3 and d4, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishops on g7 and c8, Knights on b8 and f6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g6, h7.

**Key features:**
- Black's king is still in the center, and White has a lead in development.
- The e5 pawn is attacked by the d4 knight and the g5 bishop.
- The g5 bishop is attacked by the h6 pawn, but not currently under threat.
- White can consider tactical shots due to Black's uncastled king and loose pieces.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ndb5** (not legal, as b5 is not available for d4 knight)
2. **Ndb5** (again, not legal)
3. **Nf3** (retreat, but not necessary)
4. **Ndb5** (again, not legal)
5. **Nxc6** (captures on c6, but doesn't threaten much)
6. **Nf5** (d4-f5, attacks g7 bishop and threatens Nxg7+)
7. **Ndb5** (again, not legal)
8. **Nxe6** (d4-e6, attacks queen and bishop, but after fxe6, White can play Qxd8+ Kxd8, and White is up a pawn and Black loses castling rights)
9. **Qd2** (develops, but not forcing)
10. **Bb5+** (not legal, as bishop is on g5)
11. **Bxf6** (g5-f6, exchanges bishop for knight, but not the most pressing)
12. **Bh6** (g5-h6, attacks g7 bishop)
13. **Qf3** (not legal, as queen is on d1)
14. **Qd3** (not legal, as queen is on d1)

**Most forcing move:**
- **Ndb5** is not legal.
- **Nxe6** is very interesting: after fxe6, Qxd8+ Kxd8, White is up a pawn, Black cannot castle, and White has a lead in development.
- **Bh6** attacks the g7 bishop, but Black can play Bxh6, and after Ndb5, Black can play Na6.
- **Nf5** attacks the g7 bishop and threatens Nxg7+.

Let's calculate **Nxe6**:
1. Nxe6 fxe6 (forced)
2. Qxd8+ Kxd8

Material: White is up a pawn, Black's king is on d8, cannot castle, White has a lead in development.

Alternatively, after **Nf5**:
1. Nf5 gxf5 (if taken)
2. Qxd8+ Kxd8
3. O-O-O+ (White can castle queenside, but Black can block with Nbd7)

But **Nxe6** is more direct and wins a pawn, disrupts Black's castling, and gives White a clear plan.

**Final move:**
```
d4e6
```

2025-06-26 17:06:57,783 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.63s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (9... Qd1):**
- White to move.
- White's king is on e1, queen is gone, but White has two knights on c3 and e6, bishop on g5, rook on a1, bishop on f1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black's queen is on d1, king on e8, rook on h8, bishop on g7, knight on f6, bishop on c8, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g6, h7.

**Material:**
- White is down a queen for a knight, but has a very active position.
- Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (bishop on g7, knight on f6, pawn on g6).

**Threats:**
- Black threatens to exchange queens with Qxa1, but White has no queen.
- White's knight on e6 is very strong, attacking c7 and g7.
- White's bishop on g5 pins the knight on f6.
- White can recapture the queen with a piece (rook, knight, or king).

**Legal moves:**
- e1d1 (king takes queen)
- c3d1 (knight takes queen)
- a1d1 (rook takes queen)

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e1d1:** King takes queen. King is exposed in the center, but Black's pieces are not well placed to attack.
2. **c3d1:** Knight takes queen. Keeps king safe on e1, but knight is less active on d1.
3. **a1d1:** Rook takes queen. Develops rook to d1, centralizes, and keeps king safe.

**Analysis:**
- **a1d1** is the most natural move: develops the rook, keeps king safe, and maintains pressure. The rook on d1 eyes the open d-file, and White's pieces are active.
- **c3d1** is passive; the knight on c3 is more active than on d1.
- **e1d1** exposes the king unnecessarily.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to recapture with the rook.

```

2025-06-26 17:07:38,499 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.60s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (10...Be6):**

- White: King e1, Rook d1 h1, Bishop g5, Knight c3, pawns a2 b2 c2 f2 g2 h2
- Black: King e8, Rook h8 a8, Bishop e6 g7, Knight f6, pawns a7 b7 e5 f7 g6 h7

**Material:** Even.

**Key features:**
- Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (bishop on e6, knight on f6, rook on h8).
- White's pieces are more active, especially the bishop on g5.
- White has a development lead.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nd5**: Attacks the bishop on e6 and threatens Nxf6+ (winning the bishop pair or damaging Black's pawn structure).
2. **Bb5+**: Check, but Black can block with Nc6 or Nbd7.
3. **Bxf6**: Exchanges bishop for knight, but this helps Black develop and relieves pressure.
4. **h3**: Useful, but not urgent.
5. **Qd2**: Not possible, as queen is not on the board.
6. **g3**: Prepares Bg2, but not urgent.
7. **Rd6**: Not possible, as pawn blocks.

**Deep analysis of Nd5:**
- 11. Nc3-d5 attacks Be6 and threatens Nxf6+.
- If 11...Nxd5, 12. exd5 wins a piece (bishop on e6 is hanging).
- If 11...Bxd5, 12. Nxd5 wins a piece (bishop on g7 is hanging).
- If 11...Qxd5, queen is not on the board.
- If 11...h6, 12. Nxf6+ Bxf6 13. Bxf6 wins a pawn.

**Conclusion:** 11. Nd5 is a strong move, attacking the bishop and threatening to win material.

**Final move:**

2025-06-26 17:08:23,710 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.65s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn2k2r/pp2ppbp/5np1/3bp1B1/8/8/PPP2PPP/3RKB1R w Kkq - 0 11

**White to move.**

**Material:** Equal (both sides have all pieces except White is up an exchange: White has two rooks, Black has one rook and two bishops).

**King safety:** Both kings are relatively safe, but Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (the bishop on g7 blocks the rook, and the knight on f6 blocks the bishop).

**Piece activity:** 
- White's dark-squared bishop is very active on g5, eyeing f6 and h6.
- White's rook is on d1, controlling the open file.
- Black's pieces are somewhat cramped, especially the bishop on d5 and the knight on f6.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5h6**: Bishop takes h6, threatening mate on g7. But Black can respond with ...Bxh6.
2. **g5f6**: Bishop takes f6, attacking the knight and threatening to double Black's pawns if ...Bxf6.
3. **h1g1**: Rook to g1, preparing to attack the g-file.
4. **f1b5**: Bishop to b5+, checking the king and forcing ...Nc6 or ...Nbd7.
5. **d1d5**: Rook takes bishop on d5, but the bishop is protected by the knight on f6.

Let's analyze the most forcing moves:

### 1. Bxf6 (g5f6)
- If ...Bxf6, White can play Rxd5, winning a pawn and opening the position.
- If ...Nxf6, White can play Bb5+, and Black cannot block with the knight (since it's gone), so ...Nc6 is forced, and White can castle queenside or play Qd6.

### 2. Bh6 (g5h6)
- Black will respond ...Bxh6, and White doesn't gain anything.

### 3. Bb5+ (f1b5)
- Forces ...Nc6, but then Black's pieces are more coordinated, and White doesn't gain material.

### 4. Rxd5 (d1d5)
- The bishop is protected by the knight, so this loses material.

### 5. Rook moves (h1g1)
- Prepares to attack, but not immediately threatening.

### 6. f3 or h3
- Quiet moves, not pressing the advantage.

### 7. Castling (e1e2, e1d2)
- Not urgent, as the king is not under threat.

**Best move:**
The most promising is **Bxf6** (g5f6), as it forces Black to recapture, after which White can play Rxd5 and win a pawn, or if ...Nxf6, then Bb5+ is very strong.

Let's check the line:
1. Bxf6 Bxf6 (if Nxf6, then Bb5+ is strong)
2. Rxd5 (wins a pawn, as the bishop is now unprotected)

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g5f6
```

2025-06-26 17:09:07,689 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move:**
- Black's king is on e8, unable to castle kingside (rook moved), but queenside castling is still possible (Kkq in FEN).
- Black's bishop pair is active, with a bishop on d5 and f6.
- White has a rook on d1, bishop on g1, king on e1, and pawns on c2, b2, a2, f2, g2, h2.
- White's development is lagging (kingside bishop and rook not developed).
- No immediate threats from Black, but Black's bishops control important diagonals.
- White's king is still in the center, but Black's pieces are not poised for a direct attack.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Develop kingside bishop:** f1b5, f1c4, f1d3, f1e2
2. **Castle kingside:** h1g1
3. **Centralize rook:** d1d5 (attacks bishop, but bishop is defended by pawn)
4. **Pawn moves:** h2h3, g2g3, c2c3, etc.

**Strategic considerations:**
- White should complete development and ensure king safety.
- Castling kingside is possible and safe.
- Developing the bishop first (e.g., f1b5 or f1c4) could prepare for castling and put pressure on Black's queenside.
- d1d5 is not effective as the bishop is defended.

**Tactical considerations:**
- No immediate tactics for White.
- Black may consider queenside castling, so keeping pressure on the queenside is useful.

**Best move:**
- **h1g1** (castle kingside): This secures the king, connects the rooks, and prepares for further development. There is no immediate threat from Black, so castling is safe and optimal.

2025-06-26 17:10:01,310 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.60s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (d1), Bishop (f1), Rook (g1), pawns on b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, King (e1)
- Black: Rook (h8), King (e8), Bishop (a2, f6), pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g6, h7

**Position:**
- Black has a bishop on a2, which is active but not immediately threatening.
- Black's king is on e8, unable to castle, and somewhat exposed.
- White's king is on e1, relatively safe.
- White's rook on d1 is well-placed on an open file.
- White's bishop on f1 is undeveloped.
- White's rook on g1 is on a semi-open file.

**Strategic considerations:**
- White is behind in material (down a pawn and the exchange: two rooks vs. rook and two bishops).
- Black's bishop pair is strong, but White has more active pieces.
- White needs to activate the light-squared bishop and coordinate rooks for counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Develop the bishop: f1b5, f1c4, f1d3, f1e2
2. Double rooks on the d-file: d1d7, d1d6, d1d5, etc.
3. King safety: e1e2, e1d2
4. Pawn moves: h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, etc.

**Tactical checks:**
- No immediate threats from Black.
- No direct tactics for White, but development is key.

**Best plan:**
- Develop the bishop to a good square, preferably with tempo or pressure.
- f1b5 attacks the rook on a8 and threatens to exchange off a strong bishop.
- f1c4 develops with tempo, but doesn't attack anything directly.
- f1d3 develops, but doesn't threaten anything.
- f1e2 prepares to double rooks, but is passive.

**Move selection:**
- f1b5 is the most active, attacks the rook, and forces Black to respond.

**Final move:**
```
f1b5

- White's bishop on b5 is attacking c6.
- White can consider doubling rooks on the d-file or playing actively with the bishop.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5xc6** (captures the knight, wins a piece for a pawn, but allows Black to recapture with the b-pawn, opening the b-file for Black's rook)
2. **b5a6** (attacks the bishop on a2, but Black can play ...Nb4 or ...Nd4)
3. **d1d7** (invades the 7th rank, but Black can castle queenside)
4. **c2c3** (attacks the bishop on a2, but Black can play ...Bb3)
5. **g2g3** (prepares to fianchetto, but not urgent)
6. **h2h3** (prevents ...g5, but not urgent)
7. **b2b3** (attacks the bishop, but weakens the c3 square)
8. **g1h1** (rook lift, but not urgent)

**Deep analysis:**

- **b5xc6** is the most forcing move. Let's see what happens after:
    - 1. b5xc6 b7xc6 (forced)
    - Now, White has won a piece for a pawn. Black's bishop on a2 is still active, but White can play b2-b3 next to attack it.
    - White can follow up with b2-b3, c2-c4, and centralize the king.
    - Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside. If Black castles queenside, White can try to open the c-file.
    - White is clearly better after this sequence.

Other moves are less forcing and do not win material immediately.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the knight on c6.

2025-06-26 17:11:06,689 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.42s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k2r/p3pp1p/2p2bp1/4p3/8/8/bPP2PPP/3RK1R1 w kq - 0 15

**White:** King on e1, Rook on d1, Rook on g1, pawns on b2, c2, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on e8, Rook on h8, Rook on a8, Bishop on a2, Bishop on f6, pawns on a7, c6, e5, f7, g6, h7

**Material:** White is down a pawn, but Black's bishop on a2 is very strong, and Black has the bishop pair. Black's king is still in the center and both sides have castling rights.

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black threatens ...e4, activating the bishop on f6 and opening lines.
- White's king is relatively safe, but Black's bishops are active.
- White's rooks are connected and can potentially invade via the d-file.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c2c4** - Attacks the bishop on a2, gains space, and prepares to develop the queen's rook.
2. **b2b3** - Attacks the bishop on a2, but weakens the c3 square.
3. **d1d6** - Invades the 6th rank, attacking c6 and f6, but Black can defend with Be7.
4. **h2h3** - A waiting move, but not urgent.
5. **g2g3** - Prepares to fianchetto, but slow.
6. **f2f3** - Prepares to challenge the center, but weakens e3.
7. **d1d7** - Invades the 7th rank, but Black can defend with Rc8 or Be7.
8. **g1h1** - Moves the rook, but not urgent.

**Deeper analysis:**
- **c2c4** is the most forcing move, attacking the bishop on a2. If the bishop retreats, White can play b3 and c5, gaining space and pushing Black's pieces back.
- **d1d6** is tempting, but after Be7, the rook is not doing much.
- **d1d7** is also interesting, but after Rc8, the rook is attacked and must move again.

**Let's check c2c4:**
- c2c4 Ba4 (only safe square)
- b2b3 (trapping the bishop, but Black can play e4, opening the f6 bishop)
- After b3, Ba4, bxa4, Black loses the bishop.

So, **c2c4** attacks the bishop and threatens to trap it with b3.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is **c2c4**, attacking the bishop and preparing to trap it with b3.

My move:
```
c2c4

2025-06-26 17:12:11,694 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.83s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rooks on d1 and g1, King on e1, pawns on b2, c4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: Rooks on a8 and f8, King on g8, Bishop on a2, pawns on a7, c6, e5, f7, g7, h7.

**Positional factors:**
- Black's bishop on a2 is strong, but currently not attacking anything critical.
- Black's pawn structure is solid, but the c6 pawn is backward and could be a target.
- White's c4 pawn is advanced and could be used to open the queenside.
- White's rooks are connected and ready to be activated.
- The king is relatively safe for both sides.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c4c5**: Immediately challenges Black's queenside and opens the c-file, possibly targeting c6.
2. **h2h4/h2h3**: Prepares to expand on the kingside, but not urgent.
3. **b2b3**: Defends c4 and prepares to develop the bishop, but not necessary yet.
4. **d1d6/d1d7**: Invading with the rook, but Black can defend easily.
5. **g2g3/f2f3**: King safety or preparing to develop, but not urgent.
6. **g1h1/g1f1**: Rook lift, but not necessary.

**Deep analysis:**
- **c4c5** is the most aggressive and principled move. It attacks Black's weak c6 pawn and opens the c-file for White's rooks. If Black plays ...Rab8, White can continue b2-b3, supporting c5 and preparing to double rooks on the c-file.
- Black has no immediate threats. The bishop on a2 is not attacking anything critical, and Black's rooks are not active.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play for queenside activity and open the c-file.

2025-06-26 17:13:07,371 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.11s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rooks on d1 and g1, King on e1, pawns on b2, c5, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: Rooks on b8 and f8, King on g8, Bishop on a2, pawns on a7, c6, e5, f7, g6, h7.

**Positional factors:**
- White is down a pawn but has a passed c5 pawn.
- Black's bishop on a2 is active, eyeing b3 and possibly supporting a pawn push.
- Black's rooks are on open/semi-open files.
- White's rooks are connected, and the d-file is open.
- White's king is relatively safe for now.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d1d6: Attack c6 and e5, invade the 6th rank.
2. d1d7: Pressure c7, but not as direct as d6.
3. b2b3: Defend c5, but may allow Ba3.
4. h2h4/h2h3: Luft, but not urgent.
5. f2f3: Attack e4, but weakens e3.
6. d1d3: Prepare to double on d-file or swing rook.
7. c5c6: Push passed pawn, but c6 is protected twice.

**Deeper analysis:**
- d1d6 is very tempting: it attacks c6 (which is only defended by the rook), and also eyes e5.
    - If ...Rxb2, White can play Rxc6, and after Kg7, Rd7, White is very active.
    - If ...Kg7, White can play Rxc6, and after Rxb2, White can play Rxc6, but Black's bishop is still strong.
- b2b3 is solid, but passive.
- d1d7 is less active than d1d6.
- c5c6 is not possible (pawn is on c5).
- f2f3 is weakening.

**Tactical check:**
- d1d6 Rxb2? Rxc6, Kg7, Rd7, Be6, Rxa7, Rb8, b3, Bxb3, axb3, Rxb3, and White is very active.

**Conclusion:**
- d1d6 is the most active move, attacking c6 and e5, and preparing to double rooks or invade the 7th rank.

My move:
```
d1d6
```

2025-06-26 17:14:01,090 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.44s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, Rook on g1, pawns on b2, c5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on g8, Rook on b8, Bishop on f6, Bishop on a2, pawns on a7, c6, d6, e5, f7, g6, h7

**Key points:**
- Black has two bishops and a rook, White has a rook.
- Black's bishops are active, especially the one on a2, eyeing b1 and supporting pawn advances.
- White's c5 pawn is advanced and could become a strength or a target.
- White's king is relatively safe for now.
- White's rook is on the g-file, but there are no immediate threats.
- Black's pawn structure is solid, but White can try to create counterplay on the kingside or with the queenside pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c5xd6 (c5d6): Captures a pawn, but after ...Bb1+ White must be careful.
2. b2b3: Defends c4, but doesn't challenge Black's bishops or pawns.
3. h2h3: Gives luft, but is slow.
4. g2g3: Same idea.
5. f2f3: Opens the king, not ideal.
6. b2b4: Tries to create counterplay on the queenside.
7. g1h1: Rook to h1, but not active.
8. g1f1: Rook to f1, possibly to defend f2.

**Deep analysis:**
- c5d6 is the most forcing move. Let's check the consequences:
    - 18. c5d6 Bb1 (check)
        - 19. Ke2 Rxb2+ (threatening mate and winning pawns)
        - 20. Kf3 (only move) Bf5 (threatening mate on f2)
        - White is in trouble.
- If White doesn't take on d6, Black will play d6xc5 and consolidate.
- b2b4 is interesting, trying to open the queenside and distract Black's pieces.
- g2g3 or h2h3 are slow, but may be necessary to give the king luft.

**Best move:**
Taking on d6 is risky due to the check on b1 and the rook invasion. The best practical try is to play b2b4, aiming to open the b-file and create counterplay, while keeping the king safe for now.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b2b4
```

2025-06-26 17:14:58,317 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.79s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, rook on g1, pawns on f2, g2, h2, c5, g3, f3
- Black: King on g8, rook on b4, bishop on f6, bishop on a2, pawns on a7, c6, d6, e5, f7, g7, h7

**Position:**
- Black has two bishops and a rook, White has a rook.
- Black's bishops are active, especially the one on a2, eyeing the kingside.
- Black's rook on b4 is active, possibly targeting b2 or supporting pawn advances.
- White's king is relatively safe for now, but Black's pieces are more active.
- White's c5 pawn is advanced and could be a strength or a target.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c5xd6**: Captures a pawn, but after ...Bb1+ White's king is exposed.
2. **g1h1**: Moves the rook to h1, possibly preparing h2-h4/h3, but passive.
3. **g1f1**: Centralizes the rook, possibly to defend f2 or prepare f2-f3.
4. **h2h3**: Gives luft, but not urgent.
5. **f2f3**: Opens the king, but could be dangerous.
6. **g2g3**: Same as above.
7. **h2h4**: Not urgent.
8. **g2g4**: Not urgent.

**Critical lines:**
- If c5xd6, Black can play Bb1+ (forcing the king to d2 or e2), then Rb2+ and the king is in trouble.
- If White plays a waiting move, Black may play d6xc5, regaining the pawn.

**Best move:**
- Capturing on d6 is tempting, but it opens the king to checks and attacks.
- Rook moves (g1f1 or g1h1) are passive.
- King moves (e1e2, e1d2, e1f1, e1d1) are not urgent and may walk into pins or checks.

**Defensive posture:**
- White is under pressure, but not lost yet. The best is to improve the rook's position and keep the king safe.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to centralize the rook to f1, defending f2 and preparing to meet Bb1+ with Ke2, keeping the king relatively safe.

Therefore, my move is:
```
g1f1

2025-06-26 17:15:17,193 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.46s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (f1), King (e1), pawns (f2, g2, h2)
- Black: Rook (b4, f8), King (g8), Bishop (a2, f6), pawns (a7, c5, c6, e5, f7, g6, h7)

**Position:**
- White's king is relatively safe for now.
- Black has two active rooks and two bishops, plus a dangerous queenside pawn majority.
- White is down significant material (two rooks vs one, two bishops vs none).
- White has no immediate threats, but must avoid mate and look for drawing chances.

**Candidate moves:**
- f1h1: Rook to h1, possibly to defend h2 or prepare h4.
- f1g1: Rook to g1, possibly to defend g2 or prepare g4.
- e1e2, e1d2, e1d1: King moves, but don't improve the situation.
- h2h3, g2g3, f2f3: Pawn moves, but could weaken king.
- h2h4, g2g4, f2f4: Pawn pushes, but could be risky.

**Analysis:**
- Rook activity is essential. Moving the rook to the g-file (f1g1) may allow for g2-g4, creating counterplay and defending the g2 pawn.
- h2h4 is a possible try to create counterplay, but Black's pieces are too active.
- Defensive moves like f1h1 or f1g1 keep the rook active and may help defend against threats.

**Best move:**
- f1g1 is the most flexible, defending g2 and preparing g4, possibly creating counterplay or at least holding the position.

My move:
```
f1g1
```

2025-06-26 17:15:34,903 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 13.09s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3r2k1/p4p1p/2p2bp1/2p1p3/1r6/8/b4PPP/4K1R1 w - - 2 21

White: King e1, Rook g1, pawns f2, g2, h2  
Black: King g8, Rook d8, Rook b4, Bishop f6, Bishop a2, pawns a7, c6, c5, e5, f7, g6, h7

Material:  
White: Rook + 3 pawns  
Black: 2 Rooks + 2 Bishops + 6 pawns

White is down a lot of material, but Black's king is somewhat exposed. However, White's only active piece is the rook on g1. The king is stuck on e1, and the pawns are not advanced.

**Candidate moves:**
- g1h1: Rook to h1, but doesn't threaten anything.
- g1f1: Rook to f1, maybe to defend f2 or prepare to activate the king.
- e1e2/f1: King step, but exposes the king to checks.
- h2h3, g2g3, f2f3: Pawn moves, but don't change much.
- h2h4, g2g4, f2f4: Pawn advances, but could weaken the king further.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens Rd1+ and Rb1+, both could be dangerous.
- If White plays a pawn move, Black could play Rb1+ and then Rd1# if the king moves to e2.

**Defensive priorities:**
- Prevent immediate mate threats.
- Try to activate the rook or king.

**If 1. g1f1:**
- Defends f2, but after Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook.

**If 1. g1h1:**
- After Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook.

**If 1. e1e2:**
- Rb2+ wins the rook.

**If 1. f2f3:**
- Rb1+ Kf2 Rd2+ wins the king.

**If 1. h2h3:**
- Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook.

**If 1. f2f4:**
- Rb1+ Kf2 Rd2+ wins the king.

**If 1. g2g3:**
- Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook.

**If 1. h2h4:**
- Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook.

**If 1. g2g4:**
- Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook.

**If 1. e1f1:**
- Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook.

**Best defense:**
All moves seem to lose quickly, but let's look for the one that prolongs the game.

If 1. g1f1, after Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook, but if 1. g1h1, after Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ also wins the rook.

If 1. h2h4, after Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook.

If 1. f2f3, after Rb1+ Kf2 Rd2+ wins the king.

If 1. e1e2, after Rb2+ wins the rook.

If 1. g2g3, after Rb1+ Ke2 Bc4+ wins the rook.

If 1. f2f4, after Rb1+ Kf2 Rd2+ wins the king.

**Is there any move that avoids immediate loss?**

If 1. g1f1 Rb1+ 2. Ke2 Bc4+ 3. Kf3 Rxg1 4. bxc5, but White is lost.

If 1. g1h1 Rb1+ 2. Ke2 Bc4+ 3. Kf3 Rxg1 4. bxc5, but White is lost.

If 1. h2h3 Rb1+ 2. Ke2 Bc4+ 3. Kf3 Rxg1 4. bxc5, but White is lost.

All moves lose, but let's play the move that at least keeps the rook on the board for one more move and avoids immediate mate.

**Final move:**  
```
g1h1

2025-06-26 17:15:38,814 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 3.13s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

FEN: 3r2k1/p4p1p/2p2bp1/2p1p3/4r3/8/b4PPP/4K2R w - - 4 22

White to move. Only legal move: e1f1

Material:
- White: King on e1, rook on h1, pawns on f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on g8, rook on d8, rook on e4, bishop on a2, bishop on f6, pawns on a7, c6, c5, e5, f7, g6, h7

Black has a huge material advantage and White is in a desperate situation. The only legal move is to move the king from e1 to f1.

Therefore, the move is:
```
e1f1
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
