Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of a chess game. As White, I have the first move. The opening move is crucial for controlling the center and developing pieces efficiently.

Candidate moves:
1. e2e4 – Opens lines for the queen and bishop, controls the center.
2. d2d4 – Also controls the center and opens lines for the queen and bishop.
3. c2c4 – The English Opening, controls the center from the flank.
4. g1f3 – Develops a knight, controls e5 and d4.
5. b1c3 – Develops a knight, controls d5 and e4.

Among these, 1.e4 and 1.d4 are the most popular and strongest opening moves.

Between e4 and d4:
- e4 is slightly more aggressive, leading to open games.
- d4 often leads to more closed positions.

Given the need to press for an advantage and play for a win, I will choose the most aggressive and classical approach.

My move:
```
e2e4
```

Let's analyze the position:

1. e4 e5

White to move.

**Opening Principles:**
- Develop pieces toward the center.
- Control the center.
- Prepare to castle.
- Avoid moving the same piece twice unless necessary.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Nf3 (g1f3): Attacks the e5 pawn, develops a knight, classical opening move.
2. Nc3 (b1c3): Develops a knight, supports e4, but less direct than Nf3.
3. Bc4 (f1c4): Develops a bishop, eyes f7, but doesn't contest e5 directly.
4. d4 (d2d4): Opens the center immediately, but after exd4, White must be ready to recapture.
5. f4 (f2f4): King's Gambit, aggressive, but less solid than Nf3.

**Analysis:**
- Nf3 is the most principled move, attacking e5 and preparing to develop the bishop.
- d4 is playable, but after exd4, Nf3, Nc6, Nxd4, Black gets quick development.
- Bc4 is good, but Nf3 is more flexible and classical.

**Conclusion:**  
Nf3 is the best move, following opening principles and putting immediate pressure on Black.

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3

White to move.

**Position overview:**
- Both sides have developed a knight and played e4/e5.
- Black's last move was Nc6, attacking e5 and preparing to develop the bishop.
- White has a slight lead in development (White's knight is on f3, Black's on c6).
- No immediate threats, but White can seize the initiative.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d2d4** – The classical center break, challenging Black's e5 pawn. If exd4, Nxd4 gives White a strong center and development.
2. **f1b5** – The Ruy Lopez, pinning the knight on c6 to the king.
3. **f1c4** – The Italian Game, developing the bishop to an active square, eyeing f7.
4. **b1c3** – Developing another piece, supporting e4 and d5.
5. **d2d3** – Solid, but less ambitious than d4.

**Analysis:**

- **d2d4** is the most principled move, striking in the center. If Black exchanges (exd4), White can recapture with the knight, gaining space and development. If Black ignores, White can take on e5 or push d5.
- **f1b5** (Ruy Lopez) is also strong, pinning the knight and preparing to castle, but Black can respond with a6 or Nf6.
- **f1c4** (Italian) is solid, but less challenging than d4.
- **b1c3** is fine, but less direct than d4.

**Tactical considerations:**
- After d2d4 exd4 Nxd4, White threatens Nxc6 and gains a lead in development.
- After d2d4, if Black plays d6, White can play d5, pushing the knight and gaining space.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is the classical center break:

```
d2d4

Let's carefully analyze the position:

FEN: r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4

White to move.

**Material:** Equal.  
**Development:** Both sides have developed knights. Black's d4 pawn is advanced and can be a target.  
**King Safety:** Both kings are safe.  
**Center:** Black has a pawn on d4, White has a pawn on e4.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Nxd4** (f3d4): Recaptures the pawn, develops a piece, and maintains central control.
2. **Bc4** (f1c4): Develops a piece, attacks f7, but leaves the pawn on d4.
3. **Bb5** (f1b5): Pins the knight, but again leaves the pawn on d4.
4. **c3** (c2c3): Attacks the d4 pawn, but allows Black to exchange and open the c-file.
5. **e5** (e4e5): Pushes, but Black can play d6 or Qe7, and the pawn on d4 remains.
6. **Nxd4** (f3d4): This is the most natural, regaining the pawn and developing.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- After Nxd4, if Nxd4, Qxd4, White is fine.
- No immediate tactics for Black after Nxd4.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Regaining the pawn is important.
- Developing pieces and preparing to castle is key.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to recapture the pawn with the knight, maintaining material equality and central control.

My move:
```
f3d4
```

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5

- Black's knight is on d4, centralized and active.
- White has a slight lead in development (White to move).
- White's queen and bishop can coordinate to attack.
- The knight on d4 is not protected by a pawn, only by the queen.
- White can develop with tempo by attacking the knight.

Candidate moves:
1. **Nb1c3**: Develops a piece, attacks the knight on d4, and supports the center.
2. **Qd1d4**: Captures the knight, but Black can recapture with the queen, leading to queen exchanges and a symmetrical position.
3. **Bc1e3**: Develops a piece, attacks the knight, but allows ...Nc6.
4. **c2c3**: Attacks the knight, but blocks the queen's defense of d4.
5. **f2f4**: Aggressive, but weakens the king.

Let's evaluate:
- **Nb1c3** is the most natural, developing a piece and attacking the knight. If Black exchanges, White recaptures with the queen, gaining central control and development.
- **Qd1d4** exchanges queens, but White loses the initiative.
- **c2c3** is less effective than Nc3, as it blocks the queen and doesn't develop a piece.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to develop the knight to c3, attacking the d4 knight and preparing to recapture with the queen if Black exchanges.

Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 5...Nc6:**
- White pawns: a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black pawns: a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g7, h7
- White pieces: Ra1, Qd1, Bc1, Bf1, Nc3, Ke1
- Black pieces: Ra8, Qd8, Bc8, Bf8, Nc6, Ke8

**White to move.**

**Key points:**
- Material is equal.
- Black's king is still in the center, uncastled.
- White has a slight lead in development.
- The center is open, so rapid development and king safety are critical.
- White's c3 knight is attacked by the c6 knight, but not currently under threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bf1-c4**: Develops a piece, eyes f7, and prepares to castle.
2. **Bc1-e3**: Develops, supports d4, and prepares to castle queenside.
3. **Qd1-h5**: Immediate pressure on f7, but Black can defend with g6.
4. **Qd1-d5**: Centralizes the queen, attacks c7, but can be met by Qf6 or Qe7.
5. **Nc3-d5**: Trades knights, but gives up the bishop pair and doesn't press for an advantage.
6. **e4-e5**: Gains space, attacks the knight, but Black can play Qe7 or Bb4.
7. **Bc1-g5**: Pins the knight, but Black can play Be7.

**Best move:**
- **Bc4** is the most natural, developing a piece, targeting f7, and preparing to castle. It keeps the initiative and puts pressure on Black's position.

2025-06-26 17:30:28,885 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.43s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 6...Nf6:**
- White: King e1, Queen d1, Rooks a1/h1, Bishop c4, Knight c3, pawns a2/b2/c2/e4/f2/g2/h2
- Black: King e8, Queen d8, Rooks a8/h8, Bishop c8/f8, Knight f6, pawns a7/b7/c7/d7/e7/f7/g7/h7

**Key points:**
- White has a slight lead in development (both bishops and knight out, king ready to castle).
- Black is behind in development (only knight f6 out, both bishops and queenside pieces undeveloped).
- No immediate threats to White's king; White can castle kingside.
- White's bishop on c4 eyes f7, a sensitive square.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e1g1 (castle kingside):** Safe, develops rook, king safety.
2. **d1e2/d1f3:** Develop queen, connect rooks, but not urgent.
3. **c4f7:** Bishop sacrifice (Bxf7+). After Kxf7, Qd5+ wins back the piece with check and attacks the knight, but Black can defend with Ke8 or Kg6. Let's calculate:
   - 1. Bxf7+ Kxf7 2. Qd5+ Ke8 (or Kg6) 3. Qxe4+ Qe7 and Black is fine.
   - Not enough compensation for the piece.
4. **c3d5:** Knight to d5 attacks c7 and f6, but Black can play Nxd5, exd5, and then d6 or Be7, and White has a space advantage.
5. **e4e5:** Attack the knight, but Black can play Nxe5, and after Bb3, White has some initiative, but not decisive.
6. **h2h3/g2g3:** Prevent Bg4, but not urgent.
7. **d1d5:** Queen to d5 attacks f7 and c6, but Black can block with Qe7 or Be7.

**Best move:**
- Castling kingside is the most logical, safe, and improves king safety while connecting the rooks. No immediate tactics are better.

**Final move:**
```
e1g1

2025-06-26 17:31:28,759 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 11.15s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 8...Nf6:**

- White: King on g1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c4, Knight on c3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishop on c8 and f8, Knight on f6, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d6, f7, g7, h7.

**Key features:**
- White has completed development and castled.
- Black's king is still in the center.
- White's bishop on c4 is eyeing f7.
- The knight on c3 is well placed.
- Black's d6 pawn is backward and could be a target.
- White has a lead in development.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c4xf7+** (Bxf7+): Immediate tactical shot, attacking f7 with check. If ...Kxf7, then Qd5+ wins the knight on f6 or the rook on a8 after ...Be6.
2. **Qd5**: Threatening Qxf7# and attacking the knight on f6.
3. **Nd5**: Centralizing the knight, attacking c7 and f6.
4. **e4-e5**: Kicking the knight on f6, gaining space.
5. **f4**: Preparing e5 and f5, but not urgent.
6. **h3**: Preventing ...Bg4, but not urgent.

**Let's calculate Bxf7+:**

1. Bxf7+ Kxf7 (forced)
2. Qd5+ Be6 (only move)
3. Qxe6+ Kxe6

White is up a pawn, but queens are off and Black's king is exposed. However, White loses the bishop pair and the initiative may fade.

**Alternative: Qd5**

1. Qd5 Nxd5 (if ...Qe7, then Qxf7#)
2. exd5

White wins a piece, but Black can defend with Be6.

But after Qd5, Black must play Qe7 to defend f7, then White can play Bg5, pinning the knight.

**Alternative: e4-e5**

1. e5 Nxe5 (if ...dxe5, then Qxd8+ Kxd8, White is better)
2. Re1 (threatening f4 and f5, but not decisive)

**Alternative: Nc3-d5**

1. Nd5 Nxe4 (if ...Nxd5, then exd5)
2. Re1 (threatening Qf3)

But this is not as forcing.

**Best move: Qd5**

- Threatens Qxf7# (mate).
- If ...Qe7, then Bg5, pinning the knight.
- If ...Nxd5, then exd5, White is better.

**Final check:**

After Qd5, Black must play Qe7.

1. Qd5 Qe7
2. Bg5 Be6 (only move)
3. Qb5 (threatening Qxb7)
4. Nd5 (threatening Nxc7+)

White has a huge initiative.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np4/3n4/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 9

**White to move.**

**Material:** Equal.
**Development:** Both sides are developed, but White is slightly ahead (castled, all minor pieces out).
**King safety:** Both kings are safe.
**Center:** White has a pawn on e4, Black has a pawn on d6, but Black's knight on d5 is centralized.
**Threats:** Black's knight on d5 is strong, but White can challenge it.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c4xd5**: Recaptures the knight, but Black can recapture with the bishop or queen.
2. **e4xd5**: Recaptures the knight, opening the e-file and possibly giving White a slight space advantage.
3. **c3xd5**: Recaptures with the knight, centralizing the knight and threatening c7.
4. **c4b5**: Attacks the a-pawn, but not very threatening.
5. **c1g5**: Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the immediate issue of the knight on d5.
6. **h2h3**: Useful waiting move, but not urgent.

**Key point:** Black's knight on d5 is a strong piece, but White can recapture it with three different pieces. Let's analyze each:

### 1. c4xd5 (Bishop takes)
- c4xd5, c6xd4 (Black recaptures with the pawn)
- Now, White can play Qxd4, centralizing the queen.
- But after ...Be7, Black is fine.

### 2. e4xd5 (Pawn takes)
- e4xd5, c6e7 (Black retreats the knight)
- White has a strong pawn on d5, and can play Re1, Bf4, etc.
- This gives White a space advantage and opens the e-file.

### 3. c3xd5 (Knight takes)
- c3xd5, c6e7 (Black retreats the knight)
- White's knight is centralized and can threaten c7.
- If Black plays ...Be7, White can play Qf3 or Re1.

**Which is best?**

- **e4xd5** is strong, as it opens the e-file and gives White a space advantage.
- **c3xd5** is also good, but the knight can be challenged by ...Be7 and ...c6.
- **c4xd5** is less effective, as it gives up the bishop pair.

**Let's check tactics:**
- After e4xd5, if Black plays ...Ne7, White can play Re1, and Black's king is still in the center.
- If Black plays ...Be7, White can play Qf3, pressuring f7.

**Final decision:** **e4xd5** is the most positionally sound and keeps the initiative.

```

2025-06-26 17:33:10,901 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 10.22s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pn3/2B5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 10

- White: King on g1, rook on f1 and a1, bishop on c4, knight on c3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, rook on a8 and h8, bishop on c8 and f8, queen on d8, knight on e5, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d6, f7, g7, h7.

**Key features:**
- White has developed well, king is castled, Black's king is still in the center.
- Black's knight on e5 is centralized but not supported by a pawn.
- White's bishop on c4 is active, eyeing f7.
- White's knight on c3 is well placed.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Re1** (f1e1): Puts pressure on the e-file, especially e5.
2. **Bb5+** (c4b5): Checks, forcing Black to block or move the king.
3. **Bf4** (c1f4): Develops, attacks e5.
4. **h3**: Prevents ...Bg4.
5. **f4**: Attacks the knight on e5, but weakens e3.
6. **Nd5** (c3d5): Exchanges knights, but Black can recapture with the queen or bishop.
7. **Bb3** (c4b3): Retreats, but passive.

**Deep analysis:**

- **Bb5+** (c4b5): If ...Bd7, then Bxd7+ Qxd7, and White can play f4, hitting the knight. If ...c6, then dxc6 bxc6, White has opened the b-file and Black's king is still in the center.
- **Re1**: Prepares f4, but Black can play Be7 and castle.
- **f4**: Immediate, but after Nxc4, fxe5 Nxe5, White has some initiative, but Black can defend.
- **Bf4**: Develops, but not as forcing.
- **Nd5**: Exchanges, but Black can recapture and develop.

**Best move:**
- **Bb5+** is the most forcing. It forces Black to react, and if ...Bd7, White can exchange and play f4, gaining space and initiative. If ...c6, White can consider dxc6, opening lines.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c4b5
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/3p4/1B1Pn3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 3 11

**White to move.**

**Material:** Equal.
**King safety:** Both kings are relatively safe, but Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside.
**Development:** White is slightly ahead in development; all minor pieces are out, and White has already castled.
**Threats:** Black's last move was ...d6, opening the bishop on c8. Black threatens to develop and possibly castle queenside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5d7** (Bxd7+): Captures the bishop, forces ...Qxd7, and removes a defender from the kingside. Also, Black's queen is forced to recapture, keeping the king in the center.
2. **c3e4** (Nc4-e4): Centralizes the knight, attacks d6, and eyes f6 and g5.
3. **c1g5** (Bg5): Pins the knight on f6 if it moves there, but currently, there is no knight on f6.
4. **c1f4** (Bf4): Develops, eyes e5 and d6, but not very forcing.
5. **h2h3**: Prevents ...Bg4, but not urgent.

**Critical lines:**

- **1. Bxd7+ Qxd7**
  - Black's queen is forced to recapture, and the king remains in the center.
  - White can then play f4, f3, or develop the bishop.
  - White's position is harmonious, and Black's king is still in the center.

- **1. Nc4-e4**
  - Attacks d6, but Black can respond with ...Be7 or ...a6, and White doesn't gain much.

- **1. Bf4** or **Bg5**
  - Develops, but not as forcing as Bxd7+.

**Conclusion:**
The most forcing move is **Bxd7+**, which eliminates Black's active bishop, forces the queen to recapture, and keeps Black's king in the center. This also opens the possibility of f4 or f3, and White can continue to press.

**Final move:**

2025-06-26 17:35:51,136 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.42s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 11... Qxd7:**

- White: King on g1, rook on f1 and a1, bishop on c1, knight on c3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, rook on h8 and a8, bishop on f8, knight on e5, queen on d7, pawns on a7, b7, d6, f7, g7, h7.

**Material:** Equal (both sides have all major/minor pieces except White is up a pawn, as Black is missing the e-pawn).

**King safety:** Both kings are relatively safe, but Black's is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (bishop on f8 blocks, and king has moved).

**Development:** White is ahead. Black's bishop and rook are undeveloped, and king is in the center.

**Candidate moves:**
- c3b5: Attacks the queen and threatens Nc7+ fork.
- c3e4: Centralizes knight, attacks d6.
- c1f4: Develops bishop, attacks d6.
- c1g5: Develops bishop, pins knight if Black plays ...Be7.
- h2h3: Luft, but not urgent.
- f1e1: Centralizes rook, eyes e-file.
- a1b1: Prepares b4, but not urgent.

**Tactical ideas:**
- Nb5 threatens Nc7+ forking king and rook.
- Black's queen is on d7, so Nb5 attacks the queen and threatens Nc7+.
- If ...a6, then Nc7+ forks king and rook.

Let's check the main line after **Nb5**:

1. Nb5 attacks Qd7 and threatens Nc7+.
   - If ...Qxb5, White plays Nxb5, and Black loses the queen.
   - If ...Rc8, Nc7+ forks king and rook.
   - If ...a6, Nc7+ forks king and rook.

This move is very strong and forces Black to lose material.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play **Nb5**.

2025-06-26 17:37:22,968 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 15.57s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (13... Qb5):**

- White: King on g1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Rooks on h8 and a8, Bishop missing, Queen on b5, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d6, e5, f7, g7, h7.

**Material:**
- White is up a piece (Black is missing a bishop).
- Black has some central pawns, but White's position is solid.

**Black's threats:**
- The queen on b5 eyes the d5 pawn and possibly b2.
- Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (bishop missing), but can possibly castle queenside.

**White's plans:**
- Develop the bishop, connect the rooks, possibly prepare to double on the d-file or attack the d6 pawn.
- Consider moves like c4 to kick the queen, but that would drop the d5 pawn.
- Bishop development: Bf4, Bg5, Be3, Bd2, Bh6 (but h6 is not so useful now).
- Rook to b1 to challenge the queen.
- h2-h3 or g2-g3 to give luft, but not urgent.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c4** (attacks the queen, but loses d5 pawn after Qxc4)
2. **a4** (attacks the queen, but Qxd5 is possible)
3. **a2-a4** (attacks the queen, but Qxd5)
4. **Bishop development** (Bf4, Bg5, Be3, Bd2)
5. **Rook to b1** (attacks the queen, but queen can take d5)
6. **h2-h3** (quiet move, not urgent)
7. **f2-f4** (not needed, weakens king)
8. **c2-c3** (defends d5, but blocks bishop)

**Best plan:**
- Defend the d5 pawn, develop the bishop, prepare to double rooks or attack d6.
- c3 is a solid move, defending d5 and preparing to develop the bishop.
- Bishop to e3 or d2 is also possible, but c3 is more flexible.

**Let's check c3:**
- 14. c3 defends d5.
- If Black plays Qxd5, White can play Nxc7+ (but the knight is not on b5 anymore).
- Actually, the knight is not on the board (no knight for White), so that's not possible.
- c3 is still solid, defending d5 and preparing to develop the bishop.

**Is there a better move?**
- Bishop to e3 or d2 develops and connects the rooks.
- Be3: If Black plays Qxd5, White can play Rfd1, attacking the queen and d6 pawn.
- Be3 looks good: develops, connects rooks, and if Qxd5, Rfd1 with pressure.

**Let's check Be3:**
- 14. Be3 Qxd5 15. Rfd1 Qc6 (queen must stay on d6 pawn), then c4 is coming, trapping the queen.
- After 15... Qc6, 16. c4, the queen is running out of squares.
- If 15... Qe6, 16. Nc7+ (but no knight).
- So, after 14. Be3 Qxd5 15. Rfd1 Qc6 16. c4, the queen is trapped! The queen cannot escape.

**Conclusion:**
- 14. Be3 is a strong move, developing and setting a trap. If Black grabs the pawn, White wins the queen.

**Final move:**
```
c1e3

2025-06-26 17:39:30,729 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.69s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (14...Qd5):**

- White: King on g1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on e3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d3, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Queen on d5, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d6, f7, g7, h7.

**Black's last move:** ...Qd5, centralizing the queen, possibly eyeing g2 and threatening ...Ng4 ideas.

**White to move.**

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e3xa7** (Bishop takes a7): Grabs a pawn, but bishop may be trapped after ...b6.
2. **e3h6** (Bishop to h6): Attacks g7, but Black can castle kingside.
3. **e3b6** (Bishop to b6): Attacks c7, but Black can play ...Qc6 or ...c5.
4. **e3g5** (Bishop to g5): Pins the knight, but Black can play ...f6.
5. **e3c5** (Bishop to c5): Attacks d6, but Black can play ...b6.
6. **e3f4** (Bishop to f4): Develops, but not very threatening.
7. **e3d4** (Bishop to d4): Centralizes, but not much pressure.
8. **f1e1** (Rook to e1): Puts pressure on the e-file, eyes e7.
9. **c2c4** (Pawn to c4): Attacks the queen, gains space.
10. **h2h3** (Pawn to h3): Prevents ...Ng4.

**Critical lines:**

- **c2c4** is very tempting, as it attacks the queen and gains space. If ...Qc6, then d4 is possible, kicking the queen again.
- **Bxa7** grabs a pawn, but after ...b6, the bishop is trapped: Bxb6 cxb6, Qxb6, but then ...Nd7 and the queen is trapped.
- **Bishop moves** don't seem to create immediate threats.
- **Rook to e1** is a solid move, but not forcing.

**Let's calculate c2c4:**

1. c2c4 Qc6 (most logical, keeping queen active)
2. d4 (attacks queen again) Qxc4 (takes pawn), but then dxe5, and White wins a piece, as the knight on e5 is unprotected.

So after c2c4, if Black doesn't want to lose a piece, they must move the queen elsewhere.

If 1. c2c4 Nxc4? 2. dxc4 Qxc4 3. Qf3, White has good activity.

**Therefore, c2c4 is a strong move, attacking the queen and threatening to win a piece with d4.**

**Final move:**
```
c2c4
```

2025-06-26 17:41:06,397 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.57s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (15... Qd5-c4):**

- Black's queen is on c4, centralized and active.
- Black's king is still on e8, with both castling rights, but the kingside is undeveloped (bishop and rook unmoved).
- White's king is on g1, castled kingside, with both rooks connected.
- White's light-squared bishop is on e3, targeting a7 and c5.
- White's pawn structure is solid, but White is behind in development (queenside pieces are undeveloped).
- Black's queenside is undeveloped as well, but the queen is active.

**Tactical and Strategic Considerations:**
- The queen on c4 is centralized but could be vulnerable to attack.
- White's bishop on e3 can attack the queen with tempo.
- White can consider moves like Rc1 to attack the queen, or Re1 to pressure the e-file.
- Moves like f3 or h3 are slow and do not challenge Black's queen.
- The move e3-c5 (Bishop to c5) attacks the queen and threatens to exchange off Black's active piece.
- The move Rc1 directly attacks the queen, but the queen can move to e6 or d5.
- The move e3-a7 attacks the rook on a8, but after Rxa7, the bishop is trapped.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Bc5** (e3c5): Attacks the queen, forces it to move, and may allow Rc1 with tempo next.
2. **Rc1**: Attacks the queen, but the queen can move to e6 or d5.
3. **Re1**: Prepares to pressure the e-file, but does not challenge the queen immediately.
4. **Bxa7**: Grabs a pawn, but after Rxa7, the bishop is trapped.
5. **Bf4**: Attacks the queen, but the queen can go to e6 or d5.

**Analysis of Bc5 (e3c5):**
- If ...Qxc5, then Bxc5 dxc5, White has exchanged queens and bishops, but Black's king is still in the center.
- If ...Qa6, then White can play Rc1, attacking the queen again.
- If ...Qe6, then White can play Re1, pressuring the e-file.

**Analysis of Rc1:**
- If ...Qe6, then White can play Re1.
- If ...Qd5, then White can play Bf4, attacking the queen again.

**Analysis of Bxa7:**
- After ...Rxa7, the bishop is trapped and will be lost.

**Best Move:**
- **Bc5** (e3c5) is the most forcing move, attacking the queen and gaining tempo, while preparing to bring the rook to c1. It also keeps the initiative and does not allow Black to consolidate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e3c5
```

2025-06-26 17:42:56,699 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 11.14s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/2q5/2n5/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 16

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White: Rooks on a1, f1; King on g1; pawns on a2, b2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: Rooks on a8, h8; King on e8; pawns on a7, b7, c7, d6, f7, g7, h7; Queen on c5; Knight on c4.

**Positional factors:**
- White is down a queen for a rook and a pawn.
- Black's queen and knight are active, but Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside.
- White's king is relatively safe on g1, and White has both rooks connected.
- Black's knight on c4 is strong, but White has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rac1** (a1c1): Puts pressure on the c-file, especially the c7 pawn and the queen on c5.
2. **Rfd1** (f1d1): Puts pressure on the d6 pawn.
3. **b3** (b2b3): Kicks the knight, but after ...Na3, Black threatens ...Nc2.
4. **a4** (a2a4): Gains space and may prepare a4-a5.
5. **h3** (h2h3): Luft for the king, but not urgent.
6. **g3** (g2g3): Same as above.

**Tactical considerations:**
- If b3, Black can play ...Na3, threatening ...Nc2, forking rook and pawn.
- If Rac1, White threatens to win the c4 knight after b3.
- Black's queen is on c5, so doubling on the c-file could be useful.

**Deeper look at Rac1:**
- 1. Rac1 Nc4 (already on c4)
- If 1. Rac1, Black may play ...Qb4, attacking b2.
- After 1. Rac1, if Black plays ...dxc5, White can recapture with the rook.
- If 1. Rac1, and Black plays ...b5, White can play b3, and after ...Na3, White can play Rxc7.

**Deeper look at Rfd1:**
- 1. Rfd1, Black may play ...Nxb2, but then Rab1 traps the knight.
- 1. Rfd1, Black may play ...dxc5, White can recapture with the rook.

**Deeper look at b3:**
- 1. b3, Black plays ...Na3, threatening ...Nc2.
- 2. Rac1, Nc2, White loses the exchange.

**Conclusion:**
- **Rac1** is the most active move, putting pressure on the c-file and preparing to challenge Black's queen and knight. It also supports b3 in the future, as after b3, the knight cannot go to a3 without being captured by the rook.

**Final move:**
```
a1c1

2025-06-26 17:44:26,280 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.26s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's 16th move (d6d5):**
- White: King on g1, rook on f1 and c1, pawns on a2, b2, f2, g2, h2, no queens, no bishops, no knights.
- Black: King on e8, rook on h8 and a8, pawns on a7, c7, f7, g7, h7, queen on d5, knight on c4.

**Material:**
- White: 2 rooks, 6 pawns
- Black: 2 rooks, queen, knight, 5 pawns

**Imbalances:**
- Black is up a queen for a rook, but White has some activity.
- Black's king is still in the center and hasn't castled.
- White's rooks are connected and can become active.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rook moves: c1c4 (attacks queen), c1c3 (defends b3, attacks c4), c1c2 (defends 2nd rank), c1e1 (centralizes), c1d1 (attacks queen), c1b1, c1a1 (less relevant).
- Pawn moves: h2h3, g2g3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, b2b4, a2a4 (all pawn moves, but none seem urgent).
- King moves: g1h1 (tuck king away).
- f1e1, f1d1 (double up on e or d files).

**Tactical considerations:**
- The queen on d5 is central and powerful.
- The knight on c4 is strong, but not attacking anything directly.
- White's rooks can become active on the c-file or central files.

**Best move analysis:**
- c1c4 attacks the queen and also attacks the knight on c4. If the queen moves, White can capture the knight.
- Let's check: 17. Rc4 Qxc4? 18. Rxc4 dxc4 (Black wins a rook for a knight, not good for White).
- But after 17. Rc4, if the queen moves, White can play Rxc4, winning the knight.
- Let's check for any tactics: after 17. Rc4, if Qe6, then Rxc4 dxc4, White is down a queen for a rook and a pawn, still losing.
- But Rc4 is the most active move, attacking both the queen and the knight.

**Other moves:**
- c1d1 attacks the queen, but doesn't threaten the knight.
- c1e1 centralizes, but not as active as c4.
- h2h3, g2g3 are slow.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play Rc4, attacking both the queen and the knight, forcing Black to respond.

My move:
```
c1c4
```

2025-06-26 17:45:39,682 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.95s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/2q5/8/PP3PPP/5RK1 w kq - 0 18

- Material: Equal (both sides have all major pieces except White is down a pawn).
- Black's king is still in the center and can castle queenside.
- White's king is on g1, rook on f1, pawns on a2, b2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black's queen is on c4, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d5, f7, g7, h7.
- White's pieces are somewhat passive, but Black's queen is active on c4.
- No immediate tactics, but White must be careful not to allow Black to activate further or create threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b2b3** - Attacks the queen, gains space, and tries to force the queen away from the active c4 square.
2. **a2a3** - Prepares b4, but less direct.
3. **f2f3** - Opens the f-file, but weakens the king.
4. **h2h3** - Luft, but not urgent.
5. **g2g3** - Luft, but again not urgent.
6. **Rook moves** - All rook moves are passive and don't improve the position.

**Analysis:**
- **b2b3** is the most active move, attacking the queen and gaining space. The queen must move, and after bxc4, White can try to regain the pawn deficit and open lines for the rook.
- **a2a3** is slower and less effective.
- **f2f3** weakens the king unnecessarily.
- **h2h3** and **g2g3** are not urgent.

**Tactical check:** After b2b3, if Black plays Qb5, White can play a4, further harassing the queen. If Qc6, White can play Re1+ and try to activate.

**Conclusion:** The best move is **b2b3**, attacking the queen and trying to regain the pawn.

2025-06-26 17:46:23,432 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 12.09s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (19...Qc2):**

- White: King on g1, rook on f1, pawns on a2, b3, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e8, rook on h8, pawns on a7, b7, d5, f7, g7, h7, queen on c2

**Material:**
- White: Rook + 5 pawns
- Black: Queen + 6 pawns + rook

**Imbalances:**
- Black is up a queen for a rook, but White has some pawn compensation.
- Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (f8 is blocked), but can castle queenside.
- Black's queen is active on c2, eyeing both c-file and kingside.

**White's options:**
- No immediate threats to Black's king.
- White's rook is active on f1.
- White's king is relatively safe for now.
- White's pawns are mostly on their original squares, but b3 is advanced.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f1e1**: Centralizes the rook, eyes e-file, prepares for possible e3-e4 in the future.
2. **f1d1**: Eyes the d-file, but d1 is not particularly useful right now.
3. **f1c1**: Rook to open file, but c-file is not open.
4. **b3b4**: Expands on queenside, but does not threaten anything.
5. **h2h3**: Gives luft, but not urgent.
6. **g2g3**: Also gives luft, but not urgent.
7. **f2f3**: Weakens e3, not recommended.
8. **a2a3**: Prepares b4, but not urgent.
9. **h2h4**: Not urgent.
10. **g2g4**: Not urgent.
11. **f2f4**: Not urgent.
12. **a2a4**: Not urgent.

**Tactical considerations:**
- Black's queen is active, but White has no immediate threats.
- Black may want to play ...0-0-0 and bring the rook to d8.
- White should try to activate the rook and keep the king safe.

**Best move:**
- The most logical move is to centralize the rook. f1e1 is the most flexible, keeping options open and possibly preparing for e3-e4 in the future.
- f1d1 is also possible, but the d-file is not open.
- f1e1 is the most natural and flexible.

**Final move:**
```
f1e1
```

2025-06-26 17:47:04,888 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.83s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k2r/ppp1bppp/8/3p4/8/1P6/P1q2PPP/4R1K1 w kq - 3 20

- Material: Black is up a pawn (White has 6 pawns, Black has 7).
- Black's queen is active on c2, threatening the a2 pawn and possibly eyeing the kingside.
- Black's king is still in the center and can castle both sides.
- White's rook is on e1, king on g1.
- White's b3 pawn is attacked by nothing, but a2 is attacked by the queen.
- White's pawn structure is solid, but down a pawn.
- White has no immediate threats, but Black's king is not fully safe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e1e7** (Rook to 7th, attacking bishop, active rook)
2. **b3b4** (Gain space, but doesn't solve material deficit)
3. **a2a4** (Protects a2, but doesn't develop)
4. **h2h3** (Luft, but not urgent)
5. **g2g3** (Luft, but not urgent)
6. **f2f3** (No immediate purpose)
7. **e1e6** (Rook to 6th, but not as strong as e7)
8. **e1e4** (Centralize rook, but not as strong as e7)
9. **e1f1** (Retreat, passive)

**Analysis:**
- **e1e7**: This move attacks the bishop on e7, and if the bishop moves, threatens Rc7, invading the 7th rank and attacking the c7 pawn. If Black plays Qxa2, White can play Rxc7, threatening mate on c8 and attacking the a7 pawn. This gives White significant counterplay and activity, possibly regaining the pawn or more.
- **a2a3** or **a2a4**: Passive, just defends a pawn, doesn't create threats.
- **b3b4**: Gains space, but doesn't create threats.
- **h2h3**: Luft, but not urgent.

**Best move:** **e1e7** is the most active, creates threats, and gives White the initiative.

**Final move:**
```
e1e7
```

2025-06-26 17:47:24,743 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.06s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's 20th move (Ke7):**
- White: King on g1, pawns on a2, b3, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e7, pawns on a7, b7, d5, f7, g7, h7, rook on a8, h8, queen on c2

**Material:**
- White: Down a queen for a rook and a pawn (Black has a queen, White does not)
- Black: Up a queen for a rook and pawn

**Threats:**
- Black's queen is active on c2, eyeing the c-file and possibly the g6 square in the future.
- Black's king is on e7, but relatively safe for now.
- White has no immediate threats.
- Black's rooks are not yet active, but could become so quickly.

**White's options:**
- King moves: g1h1, g1f1 (not much effect)
- Pawn moves: b3b4, h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, a2a4

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b3b4**: Attacks the c5 square, but Black's queen controls it. Doesn't threaten much.
2. **h2h3**: Luft for the king, but not urgent.
3. **g2g3**: Same as above.
4. **f2f3**: Prepares to bring the king to f2, but weakens the e3 square.
5. **a2a3**: Prevents ...b4 from Black, but Black can't play it anyway.
6. **h2h4**: Gains space, but not urgent.
7. **g2g4**: Gains space, but weakens king.
8. **f2f4**: Gains space, but weakens e3.
9. **a2a4**: Gains space, but not urgent.

**Best plan for White:**
- White is down material and has no immediate threats.
- The best plan is to activate the king and pawns, and try to create a passed pawn or hold the position.
- Creating luft (h2h3 or g2g3) is a good idea to avoid back rank issues.
- b3b4 is a logical move to gain space on the queenside and possibly create a passed pawn.

**Tactical considerations:**
- After b3b4, Black can play Qd1+ (if White's king is on g1), but White can respond Kh2 or f1.
- Black's queen is very active, so White must be careful not to allow tactics.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is **b3b4**, gaining space and preparing to create a passed pawn. It is the only way to generate counterplay.

My move:
```
b3b4
```
