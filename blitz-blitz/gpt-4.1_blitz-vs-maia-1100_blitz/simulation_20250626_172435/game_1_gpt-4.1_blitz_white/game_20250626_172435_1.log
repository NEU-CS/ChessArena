2025-06-26 17:24:54,042 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 4.69s):
Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of a chess game. As White, I have the first move. The main goals are:
- Control the center (e4, d4, e5, d5 squares)
- Develop pieces efficiently
- Prepare for king safety (usually kingside castling)
- Avoid early weaknesses

Candidate moves:
1. e2e4: Opens lines for the queen and bishop, controls the center.
2. d2d4: Also controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.
3. c2c4: English Opening, controls d5, but less direct than e4/d4.
4. g1f3: Develops a knight, controls e5/d4, but doesn't claim the center immediately.
5. Other pawn moves (c3, f3, etc.) are less ambitious.

Of these, e2e4 and d2d4 are the most popular and strongest opening moves. Both control the center and allow for rapid development.

Between e2e4 and d2d4, e2e4 is slightly more aggressive and leads to a wider variety of open games, which is often preferable for White.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e2e4
```

Let's analyze the position:

- This is the Open Game after 1.e4 c5, the Sicilian Defense.
- White to move on move 2.
- All standard developing moves are available.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf3** (g1f3): The main line, develops a knight, attacks e5 and prepares for d4.
2. **Nc3** (b1c3): Also develops a knight, but less direct pressure on the center.
3. **d4** (d2d4): Immediate central break, but after cxd4, Qxd4, Black gains a tempo with Nc6.
4. **c3** (c2c3): Prepares d4, the Alapin variation.
5. **f4** (f2f4): Grand Prix Attack, aggressive but less popular at top level.
6. **Bc4/Bb5** (f1c4/f1b5): Developing bishop, but less effective before knights are out.

**Best move:**
- The main line and most principled is 2.Nf3, developing a piece, controlling the center, and preparing for d4.

**Final move:**
```
g1f3

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3

**White to move.**

**Position assessment:**
- Black has played a hybrid of the Sicilian and King's Pawn Defense, with ...d6 and ...c5.
- White has a space advantage in the center and a lead in development.
- No immediate threats from Black.
- White's best plan is to develop pieces actively, control the center, and prepare for kingside castling.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d2d4** – Immediate central break, challenging Black's c5 and d6 pawns. If Black exchanges on d4, White recaptures with the knight, gaining a strong center.
2. **b1c3** – Develops the knight, supports e4 and d5, and prepares for d4.
3. **f1c4** – Develops the bishop to an active square, eyes f7, and prepares to castle.
4. **f1b5+** – Checks, but Black can easily block with ...Bd7 or ...Nc6.
5. **d2d3** – Solid, but less ambitious than d4.
6. **e4e5** – Gains space, but Black can respond with ...dxe5 or ...Nc6.

**Deeper analysis:**

- **d2d4** is the most principled move in open Sicilian positions. It fights for the center and opens lines for development. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, White has a lead in development and central control.
- **b1c3** is also good, but less direct than d4.
- **f1c4** is fine, but d4 is more urgent to claim the center.

**Tactical considerations:**
- No immediate tactics for Black after d4.
- After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black cannot play ...Nc6 without blocking the c8 bishop, and ...Nf6 can be met with Nc3.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is the immediate central break:

```
d2d4

Let's carefully analyze the position:

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4

White to move.

**Material:** Equal  
**Development:**  
- White: Knights on f3, bishops undeveloped, king safe, center pawns advanced.
- Black: Knights undeveloped, bishops undeveloped, king safe, center pawns advanced.

**Tactical considerations:**
- Black just played ...d4, attacking the knight on f3.
- White can recapture with the knight (f3xd4), restoring material balance and maintaining a strong center.
- Other moves (like e4-e5, or developing a bishop) ignore the threat to the knight and lose material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. f3xd4 (recapture pawn, maintain center)
2. e4-e5 (ignore threat, lose knight)
3. Develop bishop (ignore threat, lose knight)

Clearly, the best move is to recapture the pawn with the knight, keeping material balance and a strong center.

**Final move:**
```
f3d4
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5

**White to move.**

**Material:** Equal.

**Position:**
- White has a knight on d4, Black has a knight on f6.
- Black's bishop on f8 and queen on d8 are undeveloped.
- White has a strong center and more space.
- Black's king is still in the center, so rapid development and opening lines could be advantageous.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nc3** (develops, supports d4, prepares for Be3/Bg5)
2. **Bb5+** (checks, could provoke ...Bd7 or ...Nbd7)
3. **Bc4** (develops, eyes f7, keeps pressure)
4. **f3** (supports e4, but blocks bishop)
5. **e5** (gains space, attacks knight, but after ...dxe5, White can play Nf3 or Nf5)
6. **h3** (prevents ...Bg4, but slow)
7. **Qf3** (develops queen, eyes b7, but early queen moves can be risky)
8. **Nc6** (Nd4-c6, attacks b8 rook, but Black can play ...Nxc6)
9. **Nf5** (Nd4-f5, attacks g7 and e7, but can be kicked with ...g6)

**Deeper analysis:**

- **Bb5+**: If ...Bd7, then Bxd7+ Qxd7, and White can continue development with Nc3.
- **Bc4**: Develops, eyes f7, but doesn't pose an immediate threat.
- **Nc3**: Solid, supports center, prepares for Be3/Bg5.
- **e5**: If ...dxe5, then Nf3 or Nf5. If ...Nfd7, White has more space.

**Let's check Bb5+:**
1. Bb5+ Bd7 (forced)
2. Bxd7+ Qxd7
Now, White has exchanged a bishop for a knight, but Black's queen is developed. White can continue with Nc3.

**Let's check Nc3:**
1. Nc3 (develops, supports d5, prepares Be3/Bg5)
Black may play ...e6, ...g6, ...Be7, ...Nc6.

**Let's check e5:**
1. e5 dxe5
2. Nf3 (retreat)
Or
1. e5 Nfd7
2. exd6 exd6
White has a slight space advantage.

**Let's check Bc4:**
1. Bc4 e6 (prepares ...Be7)
2. Nc3

**Conclusion:**
- **Nc3** is the most natural, solid, and flexible move, supporting the center and preparing for further development.
- **Bb5+** is tempting but doesn't gain much.
- **e5** is aggressive, but after ...dxe5, White's center is less strong.

**Final move:**
```
b1c3

2025-06-26 17:28:50,938 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.62s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 5...g6:**

- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1/h1, Bishops on c1/f1, Knights on d4/c3, Pawns on a2/b2/c2/e4/f2/g2/h2
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8/h8, Bishops on c8/f8, Knights on b8/f6, Pawns on a7/b7/d6/e7/f7/g6/h7

**Key points:**
- White has a strong center (pawns on e4, knights on d4/c3).
- Black has fianchettoed the kingside bishop (g6), likely to play Bg7.
- No pieces have been exchanged yet.
- White to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c1-g5** (Bishop pin): Develops, pins f6 knight, threatens to exchange a key defender.
2. **f1-c4** (Bishop development): Eyes f7, rapid development.
3. **d1-d2/d3** (Queen development): Prepares to castle queenside, but not urgent.
4. **c3-d5** (Knight jump): Centralizes, but can be exchanged by Nxd5.
5. **Bishop f1-e2**: Prepares to castle, but less active.
6. **h2-h3**: Prevents Bg4, but not urgent.
7. **e4-e5**: Gains space, but Black can respond with dxe5 or d5.

**Deep analysis:**

- **Bg5**: If ...Bg7, then Qd2 and long castle is possible, with pressure on f6 and kingside.
- **Bc4**: If ...Bg7, White can castle kingside or queenside, but less pressure than Bg5.
- **e4-e5**: If ...dxe5, Nf3, Black can play Qxd1+, Kxd1, and White loses castling rights. Not ideal.
- **Nxc6**: After bxc6, Black has doubled pawns but opens b-file for rook.

**Best move:**
- **Bg5** is the most active, develops a piece, pins the knight, and keeps options open for both castling sides.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c1g5
```

2025-06-26 17:29:42,927 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.94s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 6...Bg7:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishops on g5 and f1, Knights on c3 and d4, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishops on g7 and c8, Knights on b8 and f6, pawns on a7, b7, d6, e7, f7, g6, h7.

**Key features:**
- White has a lead in development.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped.
- White's bishop on g5 is pinning the knight on f6.
- White has a strong center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e4-e5**: Attacks the knight on f6, gains space, and opens lines. If ...dxe5, then Ndb5 or Nf3, and White can continue to develop with pressure.
2. **Qd2**: Prepares long castling, connects rooks, and eyes h6.
3. **Ndb5**: Threatens Nc7+ fork, but Black can play a6.
4. **Bb5+**: Not possible yet.
5. **Nxc6**: Not effective, as after bxc6, Black's center is reinforced.
6. **Bxf6**: Exchanges bishop for knight, but Black's bishop pair could become strong.
7. **h3**: Useful, but not urgent.
8. **f3**: Supports e4, but not necessary yet.

**Deeper look at e4-e5:**
- If ...dxe5, then Ndb5 threatens Nc7+.
- If ...Nh5, then exd6 Qxd6 Ndb5, again Nc7+ ideas.
- If ...Nfd7, then exd6, and White is better.

**Deeper look at Qd2:**
- Prepares long castling, but Black can play Nc6, and White's initiative is less direct.

**Deeper look at Ndb5:**
- Threatens Nc7+, but Black can play a6, and the knight must retreat.

**Conclusion:**
The most aggressive and principled move is **e4-e5**, attacking the pinned knight and opening the center while Black is behind in development.

My move:
```
e4e5
```

2025-06-26 17:30:54,556 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.33s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's 7...e5:**

- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishops on g5 and f1, Knights on c3 and d4, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishops on g7, Knights on b8 and f6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g6, h7.

**Key features:**
- White has more space and better development.
- Black's king is still in the center.
- White's bishop on g5 is active, pinning the knight on f6.
- White's knight on d4 is centralized.
- Black's bishop on g7 is fianchettoed, but Black's queenside is undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ndb5** (not legal, but c3b5 is): Threatens Nc7+ fork.
2. **Ndb5** is not legal, but c3d5 is. That puts pressure on f6 and threatens Nc7+.
3. **Ndb5** is not legal, but d4b5 is. That threatens to jump to c7.
4. **Bxf6** (g5f6): Removes Black's strong knight, but after Bxf6, Qxf6, Black has the bishop pair.
5. **Ndb5** is not legal, but d4e6 is. This attacks the queen and bishop, but after Qxd1+, Rxd1 Bxe6, White is fine but not better.
6. **Nxc6** (d4c6): Attacks the queen and bishop, but after Qxd1+, Rxd1 Nxc6, Black is fine.
7. **Qd2** (not in the list, but d1d2): Prepares to castle queenside.
8. **Qf3** (d1f3): Threatens to take on f6 and pressure b7.

**Tactical shots:**
- **Ndb5** (not legal), but c3d5 is interesting.
- **d4b5**: Threatens Nc7+ fork.
- **Bxf6**: Exchanges a strong piece.

**Let's calculate c3d5:**
- 1. c3d5 Nxd5 (forced)
- 2. Bxd8 Kxd8
- White has won the exchange (rook for bishop).

But after c3d5, if Black doesn't take, White threatens Nc7+.

**Let's check d4b5:**
- 1. d4b5 Qxd1+ (forced)
- 2. Rxd1 Na6 (defends c7)
- 3. Nd6+ Ke7
- 4. Nxc8+ Raxc8
- White is up a pawn and has a strong position.

**Let's check g5f6:**
- 1. g5f6 Qxf6
- 2. Nd5 Qd8
- 3. Nb5 Na6
- White has a slight initiative, but not as strong as the previous lines.

**Best move:**
- **d4b5** looks very strong, threatening Nc7+ and forcing Black to react. After Qxd1+, Rxd1 Na6, White can play Nd6+ and Nxc8, winning the exchange.

**Final move:**
```
d4b5
```

2025-06-26 17:31:52,061 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.40s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns

**Position:**
- White has a knight on b5, threatening to jump to c7 (forking king and rook).
- Black's king is on e8, queen on d8, knight on d7, bishop on g7, knight on f6, bishop on g7, pawns on a7, b7, f7, g6, h7, e5.
- White's bishop on g5 is active, knight on c3, knight on b5, queen on d1, king on e1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.

**Tactical opportunities:**
- Nb5-c7+ is a fork, attacking the king and rook on a8.
- Black's knight on d7 covers c7, but after Nc7+, Kf8 (or Kf7), Nxa8 wins the exchange.
- Is there anything better? Let's check for direct attacks or mate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Nb5-c7+ (fork, wins the exchange)
2. Qd1-d6 (attacks e5, but not as forcing)
3. Bishop moves (g5-h6, g5-f6, etc.) — none seem to create immediate threats.
4. Develop with f1-c4, but not as forcing as Nc7+.

**Calculation:**
- 1. Nc7+ Kf8 (if Kf8, then Nxa8, White wins the exchange and a pawn)
- 1... Qxc7 is not possible (queen is on d8, not c7)
- 1... Qe7 is possible, but then Nxa8, and White is up material.

No immediate mate, but Nc7+ is a clear win of the exchange and a pawn, with no compensation for Black.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
b5c7
```

2025-06-26 17:33:05,663 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 13.89s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 9...Qc7:**

- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on g5, Knight on c3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, e2, f2
- Black: King on e8, Queen on c7, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishop on g7, Knight on f6, pawns on a7, b7, c7, e5, f7, g6, h7

**Key features:**
- Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (bishop on g7, knight on f6, pawn on g6).
- White's pieces are active, especially the bishop on g5.
- Black's queen is on c7, possibly vulnerable to tactics.
- White has a development lead.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nb5**: Attacks the queen and c7, but c7 is protected by the queen and knight.
2. **Nd5**: Centralizes the knight, attacks e7 and c7, but can be captured by Nxd5.
3. **Qd6**: Queen invasion, but can be met by ...Qxd6.
4. **Nb5**: Not possible, knight is on c3.
5. **Qd2**: Prepares to castle queenside, but is slow.
6. **Bxf6**: Removes a defender, but after Bxf6 Nxf6, Black's king is still in the center.
7. **Nb5**: Not possible.
8. **Qd6**: Not possible, queen is on d1.
9. **Nd5**: Let's calculate: 10.Nd5 Nxd5 11.Qxd5, White threatens Qd8# and Qd6, but Black can play ...Nf6, defending.
10. **Nb5**: Not possible.
11. **Qd5**: 10.Qd5 Nxd5 11.Nxd5, but then Black can play ...Qd6.
12. **Nb5**: Not possible.
13. **Qd6**: Not possible.
14. **Nd5**: Let's check again.

**Most forcing move:**
- **Nd5** attacks the queen and threatens Nc7+ fork if the queen moves.
- If 10.Nd5 Nxd5 11.Qxd5, White threatens Qd8# and Qd6, but Black can play ...Nf6, defending.
- If 10.Nd5 Qd8, then 11.Nxf6+ Bxf6 12.Bxf6 Qxf6, White has exchanged pieces but Black's king is still in the center.

**Alternative:**
- **Nb5** is not possible.
- **Qd6** is not possible.
- **Bxf6** is possible, but after Nxf6, Black's king is still in the center.

**Another idea:**
- **Qd5**: 10.Qd5 Nxd5 11.Nxd5, but then ...Qd6.

**What about castling?**
- White can castle queenside, but not yet developed the bishop.

**What about f3?**
- Prepares e4, but slow.

**What about h4?**
- Prepares h5, but slow.

**What about d1d6?**
- 10.Qd6 Qd6 11.Nd6+, but not possible.

**What about Qd6?**
- Not possible.

**What about d1d5?**
- 10.Qd5 Nxd5 11.Nxd5, but then ...Qd6.

**What about d1d7?**
- 10.Qd7+ Bxd7 11.Bf6 Bf6 12.Nd5, but not so strong.

**What about d1d6?**
- Not possible.

**What about d1h5?**
- 10.Qh5, threatens Qh7, but Black can play ...h6.

**What about d1g4?**
- 10.Qg4, threatens Qg7, but Black can play ...h6.

**What about d1d4?**
- 10.Qd4, attacks e5, but Black can play ...O-O.

**What about d1f3?**
- 10.Qf3, attacks f6, but Black can play ...O-O.

**What about d1d3?**
- 10.Qd3, attacks d7, but not very strong.

**What about d1e2?**
- 10.Qe2, not very strong.

**What about d1d2?**
- 10.Qd2, not very strong.

**What about d1c1?**
- 10.Qc1, not very strong.

**What about d1b1?**
- 10.Qb1, not very strong.

**What about a1c1?**
- 10.Rc1, not very strong.

**What about a1b1?**
- 10.Rb1, not very strong.

**What about h2h3?**
- 10.h3, not very strong.

**What about g2g3?**
- 10.g3, not very strong.

**What about f2f3?**
- 10.f3, not very strong.

**What about b2b3?**
- 10.b3, not very strong.

**What about a2a3?**
- 10.a3, not very strong.

**What about h2h4?**
- 10.h4, not very strong.

**What about g2g4?**
- 10.g4, not very strong.

**What about f2f4?**
- 10.f4, not very strong.

**What about b2b4?**
- 10.b4, not very strong.

**What about a2a4?**
- 10.a4, not very strong.

**What about f1a6?**
- 10.Ba6, attacks b7, but Black can play ...b6.

**What about f1b5?**
- 10.Bb5, pins the knight, but Black can play ...a6.

**What about f1c4?**
- 10.Bc4, develops and attacks f7, but Black can play ...O-O.

**What about f1d3?**
- 10.Bd3, develops, but not very strong.

**What about f1e2?**
- 10.Be2, not very strong.

**What about e1e2?**
- 10.Ke2, not very strong.

**What about e1d2?**
- 10.Kd2, not very strong.

**Best move:**
After all this analysis, the most forcing and promising move is **Nd5**. It attacks the queen and threatens Nc7+ forking king and rook if the queen moves. If Black exchanges knights, White's queen gets to d5 with threats.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c3d5

2025-06-26 17:34:07,895 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.33s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 10...Qa5:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on g5, Bishop on f1, Knights are gone, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on a5, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishop on g7, Bishop on g7, Knight on f6, Knight on d7, pawns on a7, b7, e7, f7, g6, h7.

**White to move.**

**Legal moves:**
- e1e2 (King to e2)
- g5d2 (Bishop to d2)
- d5b4 (Knight to b4)
- d5c3 (Knight to c3)
- d1d2 (Queen to d2)
- c2c3 (pawn to c3)
- b2b4 (pawn to b4)

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5d2** (Bishop to d2): Develops, blocks the queen's attack on d5, connects rooks.
2. **d5b4** (Knight to b4): Attacks the queen, but after ...Qb6, the knight is not well placed.
3. **d5c3** (Knight to c3): Retreats, but less active.
4. **d1d2** (Queen to d2): Develops, but blocks the bishop.
5. **c2c3** (pawn to c3): Attacks the queen, but after ...Qxd5, Black wins a pawn.
6. **b2b4** (pawn to b4): Attacks the queen, but the a1 rook is hanging after ...Qxb4+.

**Deeper analysis:**

- **g5d2**: This is the most solid move. It develops a piece, covers the d5 knight, and prepares to castle queenside. After ...Qd8 or ...Qd5, White is safe and can continue development.
- **d5b4**: After ...Qb6, the knight is awkward, and White loses central control.
- **d1d2**: Blocks the bishop, not ideal.
- **c2c3**: ...Qxd5 wins a pawn for Black.
- **b2b4**: ...Qxb4+ wins the rook.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to develop the bishop to d2, defending the knight and preparing to castle.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b1k2r/pp1nppbp/5np1/3qp3/8/8/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 12

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 7 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 7 Pawns

**King Safety:**
- Both kings are uncastled, but White has castling rights. Black's king is still on e8 and has not castled.

**Piece Activity:**
- White's dark-squared bishop is on d2, somewhat passive.
- White's queen is on d1.
- White's rooks are on a1 and h1.
- Black's queen is on d5, centralized.
- Black's bishop on g7 is active, the other on c8 is undeveloped.
- Black's knight on f6 is active, the other on d7.
- Black's king is still in the center.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens to castle kingside or queenside.
- Black's queen is centralized but not directly threatening anything immediate.
- White has the opportunity to develop and possibly castle.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **d2h6**: Bishop to h6, attacking the g7 bishop and threatening to exchange a strong piece.
2. **d2g5**: Bishop to g5, pinning the knight on f6 to the queen on d5.
3. **d2a5**: Bishop to a5, attacking the rook on a8, but the queen on d5 covers it.
4. **d2f4**: Bishop to f4, attacking the queen on d5.
5. **d2b4**: Bishop to b4, attacking the queen on d5.
6. **d2e3**: Bishop to e3, attacking the queen on d5.
7. **h1g1**: Rook to g1, preparing to castle queenside.
8. **f1a6**: Bishop to a6, attacking the rook on c8.
9. **f1b5**: Bishop to b5, pinning the knight on d7 to the king on e8.
10. **f1c4**: Bishop to c4, attacking the queen on d5.
11. **f1d3**: Bishop to d3, attacking the queen on d5.
12. **f1e2**: Bishop to e2, preparing to castle.
13. **e1e2**: King to e2, not ideal.
14. **d1h5**: Queen to h5, attacking h7.
15. **d1g4**: Queen to g4, attacking g7.
16. **d1f3**: Queen to f3, attacking b7 and f6.
17. **d1e2**: Queen to e2, preparing to castle queenside.
18. **d1c1**: Queen to c1, not very active.
19. **d1b1**: Queen to b1, not very active.
20. **a1c1**: Rook to c1, preparing to contest the c-file.
21. **a1b1**: Rook to b1, not very active.
22. **h2h3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
23. **g2g3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
24. **f2f3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
25. **c2c3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
26. **b2b3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
27. **a2a3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
28. **h2h4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
29. **g2g4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
30. **f2f4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
31. **c2c4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
32. **b2b4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
33. **a2a4**: Pawn move, not urgent.

**Key Candidate Moves:**
- **Bishop to g5 (d2g5)**: Pins the knight on f6 to the queen, creating tactical threats.
- **Bishop to f4 (d2f4)**: Attacks the queen on d5, forcing it to move.
- **Bishop to c4 (f1c4)**: Attacks the queen on d5, develops a piece, and eyes f7.
- **Bishop to b5 (f1b5)**: Pins the knight on d7 to the king, if Black castles queenside, this could be strong.
- **Queen to f3 (d1f3)**: Attacks b7 and f6, develops the queen.

**Deep Analysis:**
- **d2g5**: If 12... Qxg5, 13. Bxg5, White wins the queen for a bishop. But the knight on f6 is pinned, so Black can't move it. If 12... Qe6, White can continue development.
- **d2f4**: Forces the queen to move, but does not create a lasting threat.
- **f1c4**: Develops, attacks the queen, and prepares to castle.
- **f1b5**: Pins the knight, but Black can play a6.
- **d1f3**: Develops the queen, attacks b7 and f6, but doesn't develop other pieces.

**Best Move:**
- **Bishop to g5 (d2g5)** is very strong, pinning the knight on f6 to the queen and threatening to win material. If Black plays ...Qxg5, White recaptures with the bishop and wins the queen for a bishop. If Black plays ...Qe6, White can continue development with Be2 or O-O.

**Final Move:**
```
d2g5

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b1k2r/pp1nppbp/5np1/4p1B1/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2qKB1R w KQkq - 0 13

**White to move. Legal moves:** e1d1, a1d1

**Position breakdown:**
- Black's queen is on d1, White's king is on e1, White's rook is on a1.
- White has two legal moves: recapture the queen with the king (e1d1) or with the rook (a1d1).
- Let's consider both:

1. **e1d1:** King takes queen. The king is exposed in the center, loses castling rights, and is vulnerable to attacks, especially with Black's bishops and knight nearby.
2. **a1d1:** Rook takes queen. The king stays on e1, keeps castling rights (if possible), and the rook is centralized.

**Strategic and tactical considerations:**
- Always recapture with the rook in such cases to keep the king safe and maintain flexibility.
- There are no immediate threats to the rook on d1 after the recapture.
- The king remains safe, and White is up a queen for a rook (since Black just gave up the queen for a rook).

**Conclusion:** The best move is to recapture with the rook.

```

2025-06-26 17:38:27,738 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.98s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (castling kingside):**
- White: King on e1, rook on d1 and h1, bishop on g5, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, bishop on f1.
- Black: King on g8, rook on f8, bishop on g7, knight on f6, bishop on g7, knight on d7, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g6, h7.

**Key features:**
- Material is equal.
- Black's kingside is somewhat cramped, but not immediately weak.
- White's bishop on g5 is active, pinning the knight on f6 to the queen's square (though the queen is not there).
- White has the bishop pair.
- No immediate tactics, but White can try to increase pressure.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5h6**: Bishop to h6, threatening to exchange the dark-squared bishop, which is a key defender of Black's king.
2. **d1d6**: Rook to d6, attacking the knight on f6 and possibly swinging to the kingside.
3. **h2h4**: Starting a pawn storm on the kingside.
4. **c2c3**: Preparing to develop the queen's bishop and control the center.
5. **f1c4**: Developing the bishop to an active square, eyeing f7.
6. **h1g1**: Connecting the rooks.

**Deep analysis:**

- **g5h6**: If Black plays ...Bxh6, then White can recapture with the pawn, opening the h-file for an attack. If Black ignores, White can consider Qd2 and Bh6, increasing pressure.
- **d1d6**: This move attacks the knight on f6, but Black can defend with ...Re8 or ...h6, and the rook may be awkward.
- **h2h4**: This is a slow build-up, but Black is not threatening anything immediate.
- **c2c3**: Solid, but not pressing for advantage.
- **f1c4**: Develops, but doesn't create an immediate threat.
- **h1g1**: Connects rooks, but not urgent.

**Best move:**
- **g5h6** stands out as the most aggressive and principled. It threatens to exchange off Black's best defender, and if Black exchanges, White gets the open h-file for an attack. If Black ignores, White can continue with Qd2 and possibly Bh6.

**Final move:**
```
g5h6
```

2025-06-26 17:39:24,117 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.72s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b2rk1/pp1npp1p/5npb/4p3/8/8/PPP2PPP/3RKB1R w K - 0 15

**White to move.**

**Material:** Equal.  
**King safety:** Both kings are relatively safe, but Black's king is slightly more exposed due to the lack of pawn cover on the kingside (h6 pawn advanced).  
**Piece activity:**  
- White's rook on d1 is well-placed on an open file.
- White's bishop on f1 is undeveloped.
- White's king is still in the center but can castle.
- Black's bishop on h6 is active, but the knight on d7 is passive.
- Black's rook on f8 and bishop on c8 are not very active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h1g1** (castle kingside): Brings the king to safety and connects the rooks.
2. **f1c4** (develops bishop, eyes f7, supports d5 square).
3. **d1d6** (active rook move, attacks e6 and b6, but can be met by ...Kg7).
4. **d1d5** (attacks e5 pawn, but can be met by ...Nxd5).
5. **h2h3** (prevents ...Bg4, but not urgent).
6. **f1e2** (prepares to castle queenside, but less flexible).

**Deep analysis:**

- **Castling kingside (h1g1):** This is the most natural move. It brings the king to safety, connects the rooks, and keeps options open. Black has no immediate threats, and White can follow up with moves like Be2, h3, or even f3 to challenge the center.
- **Developing the bishop (f1c4):** This develops a piece, but leaves the king in the center. Castling is generally preferable before launching operations.
- **Rook moves (d1d6, d1d5):** These are active, but without the king being safe, they may be premature.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to castle kingside, ensuring king safety and connecting the rooks. This is a critical step before launching any active operations.

My move:
```

  - King on g8, rook on f8, bishop on h6 and c8, knight on c5 and f6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, h7, g7
- White's pieces:
  - King on e1, rook on d1, bishop on f1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2

**Key features:**
- Black has a strong bishop on h6, eyeing the c1-h6 diagonal.
- Black's knights are centralized and active.
- White's development is lagging; the queenside is undeveloped.
- White's king is in the center, but not under immediate threat.
- No queens on the board, so king safety is less urgent, but still important.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Develop the bishop:** f1c4, f1d3, f1e2
2. **Develop queenside pawns:** c2c3, b2b3, a2a3
3. **Rook moves:** d1d8 (infiltrate), d1d7 (attack b7), d1d6 (attack e5), d1d5 (attack e5)
4. **King move:** e1e2 (connect rooks, prepare to bring king to safety)
5. **Pawn moves:** h2h3 (prevent ...Ng4), f2f3 (support e4 square)

**Analysis:**
- Rook infiltration (d1d8) is tempting, but Black can easily defend with ...Be6 or ...Bg7.
- Developing the bishop is logical. f1c4 attacks e5 and puts pressure on Black's position, but Black can respond with ...Be6, trading off the active bishop.
- f1e2 prepares to connect rooks and possibly play c3, b3, and a3 to develop the queenside.
- c2c3 is a solid move, preparing to develop the queenside and giving the king a retreat square on c2.
- h2h3 is prophylactic, but not urgent.

**Best plan:**
- Develop the bishop to e2, connect the rooks, and prepare to bring the king to safety (either via e2-d2-c1 or e2-f3).
- This keeps options open and doesn't commit the bishop to a square where it can be easily traded.

**Final move:**
```
f1e2
```

2025-06-26 17:42:24,030 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.68s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r4rk1/pp2pp1p/5npb/2n1pb2/8/8/PPP1BPPP/3RK1R1 w - - 4 17

**Material:**
- Both sides have all major pieces except queens.
- Black's bishop pair is active, especially the dark-squared bishop on h6.
- Black's knights are centralized.
- White's pieces are less active, but there are no immediate threats.

**King Safety:**
- Both kings are relatively safe, but Black's king is slightly more exposed due to the open g-file and the bishop on h6.

**Piece Activity:**
- White's rooks are on the first rank, not yet active.
- Black's pieces are more centralized and active.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **e2h5**: Bishop to h5, attacking the knight on f6 and possibly provoking g6, which could weaken Black's kingside.
2. **e2f3**: Retreat, but passive.
3. **d1d5**: Centralizing the rook, attacking the bishop on f5 and the knight on c5.
4. **d1d4**: Similar idea, but less pressure.
5. **h2h3**: Prevents ...Ng4, but slow.
6. **g2g4**: Aggressive, but weakens kingside.
7. **c2c3**: Kicks the knight, but Black can play ...Na4 and then ...Nb6.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- The bishop on h6 is a strong defender and attacker.
- The knight on c5 is well-placed, but can be challenged with c2-c3.
- The bishop on f5 is defended by the knight on f6.

**Deep Analysis:**
- **e2h5**: If ...Nxh5, then g4 wins a piece. If ...Bg6, then Bxg6 fxg6, White has weakened Black's kingside and can play g4 next.
- **d1d5**: Attacks both f5 and c5. If ...Nxd5, then Nxd5, but then Black can play Nxd5 and White has no immediate follow-up.
- **c2c3**: If ...Na4, then b3, and the knight is trapped. If ...Ne6, then White has gained space.

**Best Move:**
- **e2h5** is the most aggressive and creates immediate tactical threats. If Black responds incorrectly, White can win material or weaken Black's kingside.

**Final Move:**
```
e2h5
```

2025-06-26 17:43:22,029 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.68s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on e1, Rook on d1 and g1, Bishop on h5, pawns on a2, b2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on g8, Rook on f8, Bishop on c2 and h6, Knight on f6 and c5, pawns on a7, b7, e5, h7

**Material:**
- White: 2 rooks, 1 bishop, 6 pawns
- Black: 1 rook, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 5 pawns

**Imbalances:**
- Black is up a minor piece for a pawn.
- White's bishop on h5 is active, but Black's pieces are well-coordinated.
- Black threatens ...Nd3+ in some lines, forking king and rook.
- White's king is relatively safe for now, but Black's pieces are more active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h5g6 (Bishop takes on g6, attacking the rook on f8 and threatening mate on h7 if the bishop is not recaptured)
2. h5g4 (Retreats bishop, but loses pressure)
3. h5f3 (Retreats bishop, but passive)
4. h5e2 (Retreats bishop, but passive)
5. d1d8 (Rook to d8, but Black can exchange and remain up a piece)
6. h2h3 (gives luft, but slow)
7. f2f3 (prepares to kick knight, but weakens e3)
8. g2g3 (prepares to fianchetto, but slow)
9. h2h4 (prepares h5, but slow)

**Critical Tactics:**
- h5g6 is the most forcing move. If ...fxg6, then White can try to exploit the weakened kingside.
- If h5g6, Black can reply ...Bxd1, but White can recapture with Rxd1, and the bishop on g6 is strong.

Let's calculate h5g6:
1. h5g6 fxg6 (forced)
2. Rxd1 (if Black takes on d1)
   - Now White threatens Rd6, hitting e6 and g6.
   - Black's king is exposed, but White is still down a piece.

Alternatively, after h5g6, if Black ignores and plays ...Nd3+:
1. h5g6 Nd3+ 2. Kf1 (or e2) Nxh5 (threatening mate on f2, but White can defend with Rd2 or Qe2)

But after h5g6, Black must recapture, otherwise White threatens mate on h7.

**Conclusion:**
- h5g6 is the most active and forcing move, opening the kingside and creating threats.

**Final move:**
```
h5g6
```

2025-06-26 17:44:15,177 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.81s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r4rk1/pp2pp1p/5nBb/2n1p3/8/8/PP3PPP/3bK1R1 w - - 0 19

White: King on e1, Bishop on g6, Rook on g1, pawns on a2, b2, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on g8, Rook on f8, Bishop on d1, Knight on f6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, h7

White to move.

**Immediate Observations:**
- White's bishop on g6 is very active, eyeing the weak h7 pawn.
- Black's bishop on d1 is awkward but covers some squares.
- Black's knight on f6 is defending h7.
- White's rook on g1 is on an open file, but not yet active.
- White's king is relatively safe on e1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g6h7**: Bishop takes h7, threatening Rxg7+ ideas, but after Nxh7, White loses the bishop.
2. **g6f7**: Bishop attacks the rook on f8 and threatens Bxf7+, but the bishop can be captured by Rxf7.
3. **g6h5**: Retreat, but not threatening much.
4. **g6f5**: Attacks the knight on f6, but the knight is defended.
5. **g6e4**: Retreat, not threatening much.
6. **g6d3**: Retreat, not threatening much.
7. **g6c2**: Retreat, not threatening much.
8. **g6b1**: Retreat, not threatening much.
9. **g1h1**: Rook move, not threatening much.
10. **g1f1**: Rook move, not threatening much.
11. **e1f1**: King move, not threatening much.
12. **e1d1**: King move, not threatening much.
13. **h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, b2b4, a2a4**: Pawn moves, not immediately relevant.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- If 1. Bxh7+ Nxh7, White loses the bishop for a pawn.
- If 1. Bf7+ Rxf7, White loses the bishop for a pawn.
- If 1. Bf5, the bishop attacks the knight, but the knight is defended.
- If 1. Bf5, and Black plays Bh5, then White can play g4, but this is slow.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- White's bishop is very strong on g6, but not attacking anything directly.
- White's rook on g1 could be more active.
- White could consider improving the position with a pawn move, such as h3 or g3, to prepare for future activity.

**Best Move:**
- The bishop is very strong on g6, but there is no immediate breakthrough.
- The best plan is to improve the position, possibly with a pawn move to prepare for doubling rooks or pushing pawns.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is a waiting move that does not weaken the position, such as h3, to give the king some luft and prepare for future rook activity.

Therefore, my move is:
```
h2h3
```

2025-06-26 17:45:39,040 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.25s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (…Bd1):**

- White: King on e1, rook on g1, pawns on a2, b2, f2, g2, h3. 
- Black: King on g8, rook on f8, bishop on d1, knight on c5, knight on f6, bishop on h6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, h7, g6, e7.

**Material:**
- White: Rook, 6 pawns
- Black: Rook, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 6 pawns

White is down a lot of material (a rook for two bishops and two knights), but Black's pieces are somewhat awkward, and White's king is exposed.

**Legal moves:**
g1h1, g1f1, e1f1, e1d1, h3h4, g2g3, f2f3, b2b3, a2a3, g2g4, f2f4, b2b4, a2a4

**Immediate tactical threats:**
- Black threatens to invade with the bishop or coordinate with the knights.
- White's king is exposed, but there are no immediate checks.
- The bishop on d1 is attacking e2, but that's not relevant now.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g1h1 (rook to h1): Defends the h3 pawn, but doesn't change much.
2. g1f1: Prepares to bring the rook to the center, possibly f2, and defend the second rank.
3. e1f1: King to safety, connects rook and king.
4. h3h4: Pushes the h-pawn, but could be risky.
5. g2g3: Prepares to fianchetto the king, but weakens the light squares.
6. f2f3: Opens up the king, but could be dangerous.
7. b2b3, a2a3, b2b4, a2a4: Pawn moves on the queenside, but not urgent.

**Deeper analysis:**

- The king is exposed, so moving it to f1 (e1f1) might be safer, connecting the rook and king and possibly preparing to bring the rook to the center.
- g1f1 is also a candidate, keeping the rook active.
- h3h4 is not urgent and could weaken the king.
- g2g3 or f2f3 weaken the king's position.

**Best move:**
e1f1 is the safest, as it brings the king to a slightly safer square, connects the rook, and prepares to defend the second rank if needed.

**Final move:**
```
e1f1
```

- Black is up a piece (bishop and two knights vs just a rook for White).
- Black's bishop on h6 is strong, eyeing f4 and g5.
- Black's knights are centralized.
- White has no immediate threats, and is down material.

**Candidate moves:**
- g1h1: King to h1, tucks away, but doesn't change much.
- f1e1: King to e1, centralizes, but may be exposed.
- h3h4: Pawn push, could try to open the h-file, but Black's bishop controls h6.
- g2g3: Pawn push, gives luft, but doesn't change much.
- f2f3: Pawn push, could try to undermine e4, but weakens e3.
- b2b3, a2a3, b2b4, a2a4: Pawn pushes on the queenside, but don't change the evaluation.

**Best plan:**
- White is down material and has no immediate threats. The only way to try for counterplay is to open lines for the rook and create pawn breaks.
- h4 is a possible try, to open the h-file and maybe get some play against Black's king.
- g4 is another idea, but Black's bishop on h6 controls that square.
- f3 is risky, as it weakens e3 and doesn't help much.

**Move selection:**
- h4 is the most aggressive, trying to open the h-file and create counterplay. If Black captures hxg4, then hxg4 opens the h-file for the rook. If Black ignores, White can play h5 and try to harass the bishop.

**Final move:**
```
h3h4
```

2025-06-26 17:46:09,708 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.10s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5rk1/pp2p2p/5npb/2n1p3/7P/8/PP1r1PP1/3b1KR1 w - - 1 22

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White: Rook (f1), King (g1), pawns (a2, b2, f2, g2, h4)
- Black: Rook (d2, f8), Bishop (d1, h6), Knight (c5, f6), pawns (a7, b7, e5, h7), King (g8)

**Position:**
- White is down a piece and under heavy pressure.
- Black's pieces are very active, especially the rooks and bishop.
- White's king is somewhat exposed.
- White's only active piece is the rook on f1.

**Legal moves:**
g1h1, f1e1, h4h5, g2g3, f2f3, b2b3, a2a3, g2g4, f2f4, b2b4, a2a4

**Candidate moves:**
- g1h1: King sidestep, but doesn't change much.
- f1e1: Rook to e1, but doesn't threaten anything.
- h4h5: Pushes the h-pawn, but Black's bishop on h6 controls h6.
- g2g3: Prepares to defend, but doesn't solve the problems.
- f2f3: Opens the king, but could be dangerous.
- b2b3, a2a3, b2b4, a2a4: Pawn moves on the queenside, but don't affect the defense.
- g2g4: Aggressive, but weakens the king.
- f2f4: Aggressive, but Black's bishop and knight control e4 and g4.

**Analysis:**

- The most urgent threat is Black's pressure on the second rank and the king.
- If White does nothing, Black may play ...Ng4 or ...Nd3, increasing pressure.
- Moving the king (g1h1) doesn't help.
- Moving the rook (f1e1) doesn't help.
- h4h5 is a try, but after ...Nxh5, White is just losing more material.
- g2g3 is a defensive move, giving the king an escape square and possibly preparing to challenge the bishop on h6.

**Best try:**
- g2g3 gives the king an escape square on g2 and may allow White to play Kg2, bringing the king to safety and possibly challenging the bishop on h6.

**Final move:**
```
g2g3
```

2025-06-26 17:46:20,460 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.86s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (g1), King (f1), pawns (a2, b2, f2, h4, g3)
- Black: Rook (d2), Rook (f8), Bishop (h6, f3), Knight (c5, f6), pawns (a7, b7, e5, h7, g6)

**King Safety:**
- White's king is on f1, somewhat exposed, but not immediately in danger.
- Black's king is not visible, but Black has a strong initiative and piece activity.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens to double rooks on the d-file, possibly Rd8-d1+.
- Black's bishops and knights are active, and White's position is cramped.
- White's rook is passive on g1.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. g1g2: Rook to g2, defending f2 and possibly preparing to double on the g-file.
2. g1h1: Rook to h1, defending h4 and possibly preparing h4-h5.
3. f1e1: King to e1, connecting the rooks, but may walk into a pin or check.
4. h4h5: Pawn to h5, attacking the bishop on h6.
5. g3g4: Pawn to g4, but this weakens the king further.
6. b2b3, a2a3, b2b4, a2a4: Pawn moves on the queenside, slow and not relevant to the immediate threats.

**Deeper Analysis:**
- h4h5 attacks the bishop on h6, but after ...Nxh5, Black wins a pawn and threatens further.
- g1g2 is a defensive move, protecting f2 and preparing to contest the g-file if needed.
- g1h1 is passive, but keeps the rook on the board.
- f1e1 walks into Rd8-d1+ with a pin, which is dangerous.

**Best Move:**
- g1g2 is the most solid, defending f2 and preparing to double rooks or defend the second rank. It also keeps the option of h4-h5 in the future, and doesn't weaken the king.

**Final Move:**
```
g1g2
