2025-06-26 18:06:17,933 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

White has played 1.e4, occupying the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop. As Black, I need to respond in a way that contests the center, develops pieces efficiently, and avoids falling behind in development.

Candidate moves:
1. e7e5 – Symmetrical response, directly contests the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.
2. c7c5 – The Sicilian Defense, an aggressive and popular response, aiming for asymmetrical play and counterattack.
3. e7e6 – The French Defense, solid but can lead to a somewhat passive position.
4. c7c6 – The Caro-Kann Defense, solid and flexible.
5. d7d5 – The Scandinavian Defense, immediately challenging the center.

Of these, 1...c5 (Sicilian) and 1...e5 (Open Game) are the most ambitious and theoretically sound. The Sicilian leads to rich, complex positions and offers good winning chances for Black. The Open Game (1...e5) is also very solid and classical.

Given the need for utmost caution and the desire to play for a win, I will choose the Sicilian Defense, which avoids symmetry and gives Black dynamic chances.

My move:
```
c7c5

2025-06-26 18:07:12,369 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.55s):
Let's analyze the position:

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3

White has played the Open Sicilian setup. Black to move.

**Position:**
- White: Nf3, e4, pawns on d2, c2, b2, a2, f2, g2, h2, pieces on original squares.
- Black: c5, all other pawns on original squares, pieces on original squares.

**Typical plans for Black:**
- Develop pieces: Nc6, d6, Nf6, g6/Bg7 or e6/Bd6, etc.
- Control the center, prepare for d7-d5 or e7-e6.
- Avoid early mistakes (e.g., don't allow e4-e5 with tempo, don't block c8 bishop unnecessarily).

**Candidate moves:**
1. Nc6 (b8c6): Develops a piece, attacks d4, standard Sicilian move.
2. d6 (d7d6): Prepares Nf6, solid, but less active than Nc6.
3. Nf6 (g8f6): Attacks e4, but allows e5 with tempo.
4. e6 (e7e6): Prepares to develop bishop, but blocks c8 bishop.
5. a6 (a7a6): Najdorf, but usually played after Nc6 and d6.
6. g6 (g7g6): Accelerated Dragon, but usually after Nc6.

**Critical analysis:**
- Nc6 is the most principled move, developing a piece and putting pressure on d4.
- Nf6 is playable, but after e5, the knight must move again (not ideal).
- d6 is solid, but less ambitious than Nc6.
- e6 is passive.
- a6 is premature.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to develop the knight to c6.

2025-06-26 18:07:58,581 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 5.50s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4**

White has played the Open Sicilian, and Black is to move. The current position is:

- White: pawns on a2, b2, c2, d4, e4, pieces on f3, rest on back rank.
- Black: pawns on a7, b7, c5, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7, pieces on c6, rest on back rank.

White's last move was d4, offering a pawn exchange in the center. The most principled response in the Open Sicilian is to capture the pawn on d4 with the c5 pawn, which opens the c-file and contests the center. This is the main line and leads to rich, balanced play.

Let's consider the candidate moves:

1. **c5xd4**: The main line, accepting the Open Sicilian structure. White will likely recapture with the knight (Nxd4), and the game continues with balanced chances.
2. **e7e6**: Supports the d5 break and keeps the tension, but allows White to play d5 themselves, gaining space.
3. **d7d6**: Solid, but less ambitious than capturing on d4.
4. **g8f6**: Develops a piece, but allows d5, gaining space for White.
5. **Other moves**: Moves like b7b6, a7a6, etc., are less relevant at this stage and do not address the central tension.

**Tactical check:** Is there any immediate tactic for Black? Not really—no hanging pieces, no direct threats.

**Strategic considerations:** The Open Sicilian is well-studied and gives Black dynamic chances. Capturing on d4 is the most principled and best move.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-26 18:08:50,382 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.40s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 4.Nd4:**
- White has developed both knights and established a strong center with pawns on e4 and d4.
- Black has played ...c5 and ...Nc6, contesting the center.
- It's Black's move.

**Key points:**
- White threatens to continue development with Nc3, possibly Be3, and f3 to support the center.
- Black needs to decide how to challenge the center and develop pieces efficiently.
- The move ...Nxd4 is possible, exchanging knights and reducing White's central control.
- Other candidate moves: ...e6, ...g6, ...Nf6, ...Qb6, ...Qa5, ...d6.

**Candidate move analysis:**

1. **c6xd4 (Nxd4):**
   - Exchanges a developed piece for White's knight.
   - After Qxd4, White gains a tempo attacking the knight on c6 and possibly the g7 pawn.
   - Not ideal, as it helps White develop.

2. **g8f6 (Nf6):**
   - Develops a piece, attacks e4.
   - White can play Nc3, defending e4 and increasing central control.
   - Standard development.

3. **e7e5:**
   - Strikes at the center.
   - White can play Nxc6, bxc6, Nf3, and Black has a strong center but doubled c-pawns.
   - Alternatively, after Nxc6, dxc6, Nf3, Black's center is less impressive.

4. **d7d6:**
   - Supports c5 and prepares to develop the bishop.
   - Solid, but a bit passive.

5. **d8b6 (Qb6):**
   - Attacks d4 and b2.
   - White can defend with Nb3 or Be3.

6. **e7e6:**
   - Solid, prepares to develop the dark-squared bishop.
   - White can continue with Nc3.

**Best move:**
- The most principled is to develop a piece and contest the center. ...Nf6 is the most natural, attacking e4 and preparing to castle.

**Final move:**
```
g8f6
```

2025-06-26 18:09:29,880 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.77s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 5. Nc6:**
- White's knight is on c6, attacking the b8 rook and e7 pawn.
- Black to move.
- Material is equal.
- White has a strong knight on c6, and Black's queenside is under pressure.
- Black's king is still in the center, and development is lagging.
- White threatens to win material if Black is careless.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b7xc6**: Captures the knight, but opens the b-file and leaves Black with doubled pawns. However, it is necessary to avoid losing the rook on a8.
2. **d7xc6**: Same as above, but keeps the b-pawn and opens the d-file. However, this blocks the dark-squared bishop.
3. **d8b6**: Moves the queen to b6, attacking b2 and defending c6, but White can play Nc3, defending b2 and maintaining the pressure.
4. **d8a5**: Similar idea, but less effective.
5. **e7e6**: Develops, but does not address the threat to the rook.
6. **a8b8**: Moves the rook, but loses the c6 knight for free.

**Critical threat:** White is threatening to capture the rook on a8 with Nxa8.

**Best move:** The only way to avoid immediate material loss is to capture the knight.

Between **b7xc6** and **d7xc6**:
- **b7xc6** opens the b-file for the rook and keeps the d-pawn flexible.
- **d7xc6** keeps the b-pawn, but blocks the bishop and does not open a file.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the knight with the b-pawn.

2025-06-26 18:10:20,986 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.89s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 5...Nf6:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishops on f1 and c1, Knight on c3, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishops on c8 and f8, Knight on f6, Pawns on a7, c6, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7

White's last move was Nc3, developing a piece and supporting the center. Black to move.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- White has a strong center with e4, and Nc3 supports it.
- Black's c6 pawn is slightly weak, but not under immediate threat.
- Black needs to develop pieces and prepare to castle.
- The light-squared bishop (c8) is blocked by the c6 pawn.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. ...e6 or ...e5: Both open lines for the dark-squared bishop and contest the center.
2. ...d6 or ...d5: Also contest the center, but d5 is less attractive as it can be met by e4xd5.
3. ...g6 or ...g5: Fianchetto or aggressive kingside play, but not urgent.
4. ...Qa5 or ...Qb6: Develops the queen, potentially pins the knight or attacks b2.
5. ...Bb7 or ...Ba6: Develops the bishop, but Ba6 is not effective yet.
6. ...a6: Prepares b5, but not urgent.
7. ...h6: Prevents Bg5, but not urgent.

**Most logical development:**
- ...e5 is interesting, challenging the center and opening lines for the bishop.
- ...e6 is solid, preparing to develop the bishop and castle.
- ...Qa5 is a common move in these structures, pinning the knight and putting pressure on e4.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- ...Qa5+ can be met by Bd2, and after ...Qb6, White can play Rb1.
- ...e5: If White takes with e4xe5, Black can recapture with the knight, centralizing it.
- ...e6: Solid, no weaknesses, prepares d5 or Bb4.

**Conclusion:**
The most flexible and solid move is ...e6, preparing to develop the bishop and castle, while keeping the center under control.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-26 18:11:16,634 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.69s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 6...e6:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1/h1, Bishops on c1/d3, Knight on c3, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8/h8, Bishops on c8/f8, Knight on f6, Pawns on a7, c6, d7, e6, f7, g7, h7

**White's last move:** Bd3, developing the bishop and eyeing the kingside.

**Black to move.**

**Strategic considerations:**
- Black is solid, but White has a space advantage and better development.
- Black's light-squared bishop is blocked by the pawn on e6.
- White threatens e4-e5, pushing back the knight and gaining space.
- Black needs to complete development and prepare to castle.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **...d5**: Strikes in the center, but after exd5 cxd5, White can play Bb5+ and then O-O, with a slight initiative.
2. **...e5**: Not possible, as e4 is protected.
3. **...Be7**: Simple development, prepares to castle.
4. **...Bb4**: Pins the knight, but White can play O-O and then e5.
5. **...Qa5**: Attacks c3, but White can defend easily.
6. **...d6**: Solid, supports e5 in the future, opens the c8 bishop.
7. **...g6**: Prepares Bg7, but weakens dark squares.
8. **...a5**: Not urgent.

**Deeper analysis:**
- **...d5**: 7. e5 Nd7 8. f4, White gets a strong center.
- **...Be7**: Safe, but allows e5.
- **...Bb4**: 7. O-O Bxc3 8. bxc3 d5, but White is still better developed.
- **...d6**: Prepares ...e5, keeps the center flexible, and opens the c8 bishop.

**Best move:**
- **...d6** is the most flexible and solid. It prepares ...e5, develops the c8 bishop, and keeps options open. It also prevents e5 from White (as after e5 dxe5, White can't recapture with a pawn).

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-26 18:11:55,406 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.49s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after White's 0-0 (castling):**
- White has a strong center with pawns on e4 and c2, and pieces well developed.
- Black has a solid pawn structure but is a bit behind in development, especially on the queenside.
- The bishop on c8 and rook on a8 are undeveloped.
- White threatens to play e5, gaining space and possibly attacking the knight on f6.
- Black's king is still in the center and could be vulnerable if the center opens.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h8g8 (O-O, kingside castling):** This is the most natural move, getting the king to safety and connecting the rooks. It also prepares for central or kingside play.
2. **f8e7:** Developing the bishop, but leaves the king in the center for now.
3. **e6e5:** Striking in the center, but after f4, White gets a big center and attacking chances.
4. **d6d5:** Challenging the center, but after e5, the knight must move, and White gets space.
5. **c8b7/c8d7:** Developing the bishop, but again, king safety is paramount.
6. **a7a6:** Prepares b5 and develops the queenside, but is slow.

**Critical assessment:**
- Castling is urgent. White is ready to open the center with e5, and Black's king is vulnerable.
- Delaying castling could be dangerous, especially with White's lead in development and central control.
- After castling, Black can consider moves like Bb7, Qc7, and c5 to challenge White's center.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to castle kingside, ensuring king safety and preparing to complete development.

2025-06-26 18:13:47,244 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.79s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after White's 9th move (1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. exd5 exd5 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. Bb5 Bd6 7. O-O O-O 8. f4):**

- White has a strong center with pawns on e4 and f4, and pieces are well developed.
- Black's king is still in the center, but can castle queenside.
- The c8-bishop is blocked by the d6 pawn, but can be developed.
- White's last move f4 signals aggressive intentions, possibly f5 or e5 in the future.
- Black's knight on f6 is attacked by e4-e5 ideas.
- Black's d6 and c6 pawns are slightly weak, but not under immediate threat.
- Black's queen is on d8, rooks are on a8 and f8.

**Candidate Moves:**

1. **e6-e5**: Challenges White's center, but after fxe5 dxe5, White can play Bg5 or Qe1, with pressure.
2. **d6-d5**: Solidifies the center, but White can respond with e5, gaining space.
3. **f6-d7**: Retreats the knight, but seems passive.
4. **f6-h5**: Moves the knight to the rim, but White can play f5.
5. **c8-d7**: Develops the bishop, connects rooks, and prepares to castle queenside.
6. **f8-e7**: Prepares to castle kingside, but the king may be exposed.
7. **a7-a6**: Prepares b5, but not urgent.
8. **h7-h6**: Prevents Bg5, but not urgent.
9. **g7-g6**: Prepares to fianchetto, but weakens dark squares.

**Best Move Considerations:**

- **c8-d7** is a natural developing move, connects the rooks, and prepares to castle queenside, which is safer given White's kingside pawn storm.
- **f8-e7** is also possible, but leaves the king in the center for longer.
- **e6-e5** is tempting, but after fxe5 dxe5, White's pieces become very active.
- **d6-d5** is solid, but White can push e5.

**Conclusion:**

The safest and most logical move is to develop the bishop to d7, connecting the rooks and preparing to castle queenside, which keeps the king safe and avoids White's kingside attack.

My move:
```
c8d7
```

2025-06-26 18:15:10,077 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 10. O-O:**
- White: King on g1, rook on f1, queen on d1, bishop on d3 and c1, knight on c3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e5, f4, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, rook on a8 and g8, queen on d8, bishop on d7, knight on f6, pawns on a7, c6, d6, e6, f7, g7, h7.

**Key points:**
- White has a strong center and space advantage.
- Black's king is still in the center and needs to castle.
- White threatens e5-e6, opening lines against Black's king.
- Black's light-squared bishop is somewhat passive.
- White's pieces are more active, especially the bishop on d3 and knight on c3.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6e5**: Captures the advanced pawn, but after fxe5, White opens the f-file and gets a strong attack.
2. **f6d5**: Moves the knight to a central square, but White can play Nxd5 cxd5, and Black's pawn structure is compromised.
3. **f6g4**: Attacks the bishop on d3, but White can play h3, and the knight has to retreat.
4. **d8b6**: Attacks b2, but White can defend easily.
5. **d8b6**: Also eyes the diagonal towards g1.
6. **d8a5**: Eyes the a2 pawn, but not very threatening.
7. **f8e7**: Prepares to castle queenside, but White can play e5-e6.
8. **d8e7**: Prepares to castle queenside, but blocks the bishop.
9. **g8h8**: Passive, not useful.
10. **a8c8**: Prepares to put pressure on the c-file.
11. **h7h6**: Prevents Ng5, but slow.
12. **c6c5**: Tries to break in the center, but White can play exd6.

**Critical lines:**
- If Black does nothing, White will play e5-e6, opening the center while Black's king is stuck.
- If Black plays d6xe5, after fxe5, White has a strong attack.
- If Black plays f6d5, White can exchange and play Ne4, with a strong initiative.

**Best move:**
- **d6d5**: This move challenges White's center, prevents e5-e6, and opens lines for the bishop and queen. If White exchanges, Black can recapture with the knight, improving piece activity. If White pushes e5-e6, Black can play fxe6, and the center remains closed.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d6d5
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 11. f4-f5-f6:**
- White's last move was f6, attacking g7 and threatening fxg7, which would open the g-file and create a dangerous passed pawn.
- Black's king is on e8, unable to castle kingside (rook already moved), and queenside castling is still possible.
- Black's dark-squared bishop is on d7, and the queen is on d8.
- White's pieces are very active: bishop on d3, knight on c3, queen on d1, rook on f1, and rook on a1.
- Black's f7 pawn is gone, and the g7 pawn is under attack.

**Immediate threats:**
- White threatens fxg7, which could be very dangerous, opening the g-file and threatening to promote.
- If Black plays gxf6, White can recapture with the bishop or queen, keeping up the pressure.
- If Black ignores the threat, fxg7 is coming.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g7xf6**: Accept the pawn, but after Bxf6, White's pieces are very active, and the g-file is open.
2. **d8xf6**: Not possible, as f6 is protected by the bishop on d3.
3. **Qxf6**: Not possible.
4. **e6-e5**: Blocks the bishop on d3, but allows fxe7, which is dangerous.
5. **d5-d4**: Kicks the bishop, but doesn't address the threat on g7.
6. **h7-h6**: Doesn't help.
7. **f8-e7**: Develops, but doesn't address the threat.
8. **a8-c8**: Prepares to castle queenside, but doesn't address the threat.
9. **g8-h8**: Moves the rook, but doesn't help.

**Best defense:**
- The most urgent threat is fxg7, so the only way to stop it is to play **g7-g6**. This blocks the pawn and keeps the kingside closed for now. It also gives the king a potential escape square on f8.

**Double-checking:**
- After g6, White can try f5, but Black can play exf5, and the position is more stable.
- If White tries Qe2 or f5, Black can continue developing.

**Final move:**
```
g7g6

2025-06-26 18:17:45,746 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 16.02s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 11...g6:**
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8/g8, Bishop on d7/f8, Knights off the board, Pawns on a7, c6, d5, e6, f7, g6, h7.
- White: King on g1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1/f1, Bishop on e3/d3, Knight on c3, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, f4, g2, h2.

**White's last move:** f4-f5, then Black played g6, White played Bxe3, Black to move.

**Material:** Even.
**King safety:** Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (rook has moved). White's king is safe.
**Threats:** White threatens fxe6, opening the f-file and attacking e6. White's pieces are active, especially the bishops and the knight on c3.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d8xf6** (Queen takes on f6): This loses the queen to Nxd5.
2. **d8b6** (Queen to b6): Attacks e3 bishop and b2 pawn, but allows fxe6.
3. **d8c7** (Queen to c7): Prepares to defend e6, but fxe6 is still strong.
4. **d8e7** (Queen to e7): Defends e6, but fxe6 is still playable.
5. **g6xf5** (Pawn takes f5): Not legal.
6. **e6e5** (Pawn to e5): Blocks the bishop, but White can play fxe5 or f5-f6.
7. **d5d4** (Pawn to d4): Gains space, attacks the knight, but White can play Bxd4.
8. **f8d6** (Bishop to d6): Defends e5, but White can play fxe6.
9. **h7h5** (Pawn to h5): Not relevant.
10. **g8h8** (Rook to h8): Not relevant.

**Critical squares:** e6, f5, f6.

**Key threat:** White's f5-f6 is coming, and fxe6 opens the f-file.

**Best defensive move:** Let's look for a way to defend e6 and keep the king safe.

- **d8xf6** is not possible.
- **d8b6** is interesting, but after fxe6, Black is in trouble.
- **d8e7** defends e6, but after fxe6, Qxe6, White can play Re1, pinning the queen.
- **d8c7** is similar.

**What about e6e5?**
- If 12...e5, then 13. fxe5 d4 (attacking the knight and bishop). If 14. Bxd4 c5, White's bishop is attacked, but White can play Be3.
- If 12...e5, 13. fxe5 d4 14. Bxd4 c5 15. Be3, Black has some space, but White's bishops are active.

**What about d5d4?**
- 12...d4 13. Bxd4 c5 14. Be3, White keeps the bishop pair.

**What about f8d6?**
- 12...Bf8-d6, defending e5, but fxe6 is still strong.

- White pawns: a2, b2, c2, e5, f6, g2, h2.
- Black's king is on e8, queen on d8, rook on a8, bishop on d7, pawns: a7, c6, d5, g6, h7.
- Black's f8 bishop, g8 rook.

**Key features:**
- White has a pawn on f6, cramping Black's kingside and threatening Bh6.
- White is threatening to open the g-file with moves like Qd2 and Bh6.
- Black's king is stuck in the center, and White's pieces are very active.
- Black's dark-squared bishop is on d7, but White's bishops are very powerful.
- Black's queenside is underdeveloped, and the king is unsafe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f8h6**: Exchange dark-squared bishops, but after Bxh6, Qxh6, White can play Qd2 and threaten Qxh6.
2. **d8c7**: Prepares to castle queenside, but White can play Qd2 and Bh6.
3. **d8b6**: Attacks b2, but White can ignore and continue the attack.
4. **d8c8**: Prepares to castle queenside, but again, White's attack is fast.
5. **g8h8**: Passive, doesn't solve the king safety issue.
6. **d7e6**: Tries to exchange bishops, but White can play Qd2 and Bh6.
7. **d5d4**: Kicks the knight, but White can play Bxd4, keeping pressure.
8. **g6g5**: Aggressive, but weakens the kingside further.

**Critical lines:**
- If Black tries to castle queenside, White's attack is very fast.
- If Black plays f8h6, White can exchange and play Qd2, threatening Bh6 and Qh6.
- If Black plays d5d4, White can play Bxd4, keeping the initiative.

**Best defensive try:**
- Black needs to exchange some pieces and try to castle queenside.
- The move **d7e6** offers to exchange the dangerous bishop on d3 and prepares to bring the queen to d7 for queenside castling.

**Tactical check:**
- After d7e6, if White plays Qd2, Black can play d4, and after Bxd4, Qxd4+, exchanging queens and relieving the pressure.

**Final move:**
```
d7e6
```

2025-06-26 18:20:20,555 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.99s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White has a strong center and a dangerous pawn on f6.
- Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (rook on f8 blocks, and f6 pawn is a thorn).
- White threatens to increase pressure, possibly with moves like Nf4, Qd2, Bh6, or even c4.
- Black's bishop on e6 is active, but the rest of the pieces are somewhat passive.
- Black must be careful not to get mated or lose material.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **f8g7** (Bishop to g7): Develops the bishop, attacks the f6 pawn, and prepares to castle queenside.
2. **d8b6** (Queen to b6): Attacks the b2 pawn, but White can defend easily and this doesn't solve the king safety issue.
3. **d8d7** (Queen to d7): Prepares to castle queenside, but blocks the bishop and doesn't address the f6 pawn.
4. **e6g4** (Bishop to g4): Pins the knight, but White can play h3 and the bishop may be misplaced.
5. **g8h8** (King to h8): Passive, doesn't solve any problems.
6. **d5d4** (Pawn push): Gains space, but White can play Bg5 or Nf4, and the f6 pawn remains strong.
7. **g6g5**: Aggressive, but White can respond with Ng3 or h4, and Black's king remains unsafe.

**Deep Analysis:**
- The f6 pawn is a huge problem for Black. If White plays Qd2 and Bh6, Black is in trouble.
- Black needs to develop and try to challenge the f6 pawn.
- **f8g7** is the most logical move: it develops a piece, attacks the f6 pawn, and prepares to castle queenside (since kingside castling is impossible).

**Tactical Check:**
- After **f8g7**, if White plays fxg7, Black can recapture with the king or rook, and the kingside is still closed.
- If White ignores, Black can consider castling queenside next.

**Final Move:**
```
f8g7
```

2025-06-26 18:21:57,422 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.89s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r2qk1r1/p4pPp/2p1b1p1/3pP3/8/3BB3/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b q - 0 15

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8, g8; Queen on d8; Bishop on e6; pawns on a7, c6, d5, h7, g6, f7
- White: Rooks on a1, f1; Queen on d1; Bishops on d3, e3; Knight on e2; pawns on a2, b2, c2, e5, g2, h2; pawn on g7 (dangerous, advanced)

**Key points:**
- White's g7 pawn is extremely dangerous, threatening to promote or open lines against Black's king.
- Black's king is on e8, with some shelter but also vulnerable.
- White's pieces are very active, especially the bishops and the g7 pawn.
- Black's bishop on e6 is currently blocking the g8 rook's defense of the g7 square.
- White threatens Bh6, trapping the rook on g8 or preparing to promote the g7 pawn.

**Immediate tactical threats:**
- White may play Bh6, trapping the rook on g8.
- White may also try Nf4, attacking e6 and g6.
- Black must address the threat of the g7 pawn and the possibility of Bh6.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Rxg7 (not possible, no rook on g7)
2. Qb6 or Qc7, attacking e5 and defending g7 (but not enough)
3. f5, trying to block the bishop and open lines (but White can still play Bh6)
4. h5, trying to trade off the g7 pawn (but White can ignore and play Bh6)
5. Qg5, attacking e3 and g7 (but White can play Bxg5)
6. d4, trying to open the center (but White's bishops are strong)
7. Qe7, defending g7 (but White can still play Bh6)
8. f6, attacking the g7 pawn

**Best defensive move:**
- The most urgent threat is Bh6, trapping the rook and threatening to promote the g7 pawn. The only way to stop this is to play f6, attacking the g7 pawn and forcing White to react.

**Calculation:**
- 15...f6
  - If exf6, Qxf6, and the g7 pawn is gone.
  - If Bh6, then fxe5, and the bishop is not trapping the rook anymore.
  - If gxf8=Q+, Kxf8, White is up material but Black is not immediately mated.

**Alternative:**
- h5, but after Bh6, the rook is trapped.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play f6, attacking the g7 pawn and preventing Bh6.

2025-06-26 18:23:34,960 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.82s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r2qk1r1/p5Pp/2p1bPp1/3p4/8/3BB3/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b q - 0 16

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8, g8; Queen on d8; Bishop on e6; pawns a7, c6, d5, g6, h7
- White: Rooks on a1, f1; Queen on d1; Bishops on d3, e3; Knight on e2; pawns a2, b2, c2, g2, h2, f6, g7

**Key features:**
- White's g7 pawn is very dangerous, threatening to promote or open lines.
- White's f6 pawn is also advanced, supporting g7.
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed.
- Black's bishop on e6 is active.
- Black is under pressure, especially on the kingside.

**Immediate threats:**
- White threatens to play f7+, forking king and rook, or g7-g8=Q.
- White's bishops and queen are ready to join the attack.
- Black must act quickly to avoid being overrun.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxf6** (d8xf6): Captures the dangerous pawn, but after Rxf6, White's attack continues.
2. **Bf7** (e6f7): Blocks the f-pawn, but after Qe1 or Qd2, White can build up.
3. **Kf7** (e8f7): Walks into a discovered attack after Nf4 or Bh6.
4. **Qd7** (d8d7): Defends along the 7th rank, but White can continue to press.
5. **Qb6** (d8b6): Attacks b2, but doesn't address the kingside threats.
6. **Qe7** (d8e7): Defends the 7th rank and pins the g7 pawn if White's queen moves.
7. **Bf5** (e6f5): Attacks d3, but White can ignore and continue the attack.

**Critical lines:**
- If 16...Qxf6 17.Rxf6 Ke7 18.Bg5 Rxg7 19.Rxg7+ Kxf6 20.Bh6, White is winning.
- If 16...Bf7 17.Bh6, White threatens to win on the kingside.
- If 16...Qe7, White can try 17.Bh6, but now g7 is pinned.

**Best defensive try:**
- **16...Qe7** seems to be the best move. It pins the g7 pawn, preventing g8=Q, and covers the 7th rank. It also keeps the queen close to the king for defense.

**Final move:**
```
d8e7
```

2025-06-26 18:31:02,688 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 17.50s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k1r1/p3P1Pp/2p1b1p1/3p4/8/3BB3/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b q - 0 17

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8, g8; Bishop on e6; pawns on a7, c6, d5, g6, h7
- White: Rook on a1, f1; Bishop on d3, e3; Knight on e2; Queen on d1; pawns on a2, b2, c2, g2, h2

**Key features:**
- White has a dangerous passed pawn on e7, one square from promotion.
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed.
- White's pieces are active, especially the bishops and the queen.
- Black's bishop on e6 is currently blocking the e7 pawn from promoting.
- Black's only real compensation is the bishop on e6 and the possibility of activating the rooks.

**Immediate threats:**
- White threatens to push e7-e8=Q, but Black's bishop is blocking.
- White may try to attack the bishop or remove its defender.
- Black must keep the e7 pawn under control.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6f7**: Retreat the bishop to f7, but then e7-e8=Q is unstoppable.
2. **e6d7**: Retreat the bishop to d7, but same issue.
3. **e6f5**: Bishop to f5, attacks d3 bishop, but White can play Bxf5, gxf5, and then e7-e8=Q.
4. **e6g4**: Bishop to g4, attacks e2 knight, but White can play h3, and e7-e8=Q is still coming.
5. **e6h3**: Bishop to h3, attacks g2 pawn, but not a real threat.
6. **a8d8**: Rook to d8, attacks d3 bishop, but White can play exd8=Q+.
7. **a8c8**: Rook to c8, not much.
8. **a8b8**: Rook to b8, not much.
9. **g8h8**: King to h8, not relevant.
10. **g8f8**: King to f8, not relevant.
11. **g8g7**: Rook to g7, not relevant.
12. **e8e7**: King to e7, but then e7-e8=Q+ is check.
13. **e8d7**: King to d7, but then e7-e8=Q+ is check.
14. **h7h6**: Pawn move, not relevant.
15. **a7a6**: Pawn move, not relevant.
16. **g6g5**: Pawn move, not relevant.
17. **c6c5**: Pawn move, not relevant.
18. **d5d4**: Pawn move, not relevant.
19. **h7h5**: Pawn move, not relevant.
20. **a7a5**: Pawn move, not relevant.

**Critical analysis:**
- The only thing preventing White from queening is the bishop on e6.
- If Black moves the bishop, White will promote.
- If Black plays a rook move, White can play e7-e8=Q, and after Rxd8, exd8=Q+.
- If Black plays a king move, White can promote with check.

**Is there any way to stop the pawn?**
- No. The bishop must stay on e6 to prevent promotion.
- But White can play Nf4, attacking the bishop, or Qd2, preparing Bh6, or even Bc5, attacking the bishop.

**Is there any counterplay?**
- Black could try to create threats, but White's position is too solid.

**Best practical try:**
- Try to activate the rook with a8d8, hoping for exd8=Q+ Rxd8, and then try to hold the endgame.
- Alternatively, try to create counterplay with g6-g5, but it's too slow.

**Conclusion:**
- The only move that keeps the game going is **a8d8**, attacking the bishop and hoping for exd8=Q+ Rxd8, and then try to hold the endgame.

**Final move:**
```
a8d8
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3k1Rr1/p5Pp/2p1b1p1/3p4/8/3BB3/PPP1N1PP/R2Q2K1 b - - 1 19

**Black to move. Legal moves:** d8e7, d8d7, d8c7, g8f8

**Material:**
- Black: King on d8, rook on g8, bishop on e6, pawns on a7, c6, d5, h7, g6
- White: King on g1, rook on f8, bishop on d3 and e3, queen on d1, knight on e2, pawns on a2, b2, c2, g2, h2, g7, h3

**Position:**
- White is threatening mate: Rf8xg8 is mate unless Black moves the king.
- Black's king is on d8, only escape squares are c7, d7, e7.
- White's pieces are very active and coordinated.
- Black is down material and under heavy attack.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d8e7:** King to e7. This allows Rf8xg8, but then White is just up a rook and the attack continues.
2. **d8d7:** King to d7. Rf8xg8, again, White is up a rook.
3. **d8c7:** King to c7. Rf8xg8, same.
4. **g8f8:** Move the rook, blocking the checkmate threat.

**Let's check g8f8:**
- 19... g8f8
- White can play Rxf8, Bxf8, and then White is still up a rook and the attack continues.

But if Black plays g8f8, at least the immediate mate threat is parried, and the king is not forced to move into the open. All other moves allow Rf8xg8#, which is mate.

**Conclusion:** The only move to avoid immediate checkmate is to block with the rook.

**Final move:**
```
g8f8
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3k1Q2/p6p/2p1b1p1/3p4/8/3BB3/PPP1N1PP/R2Q2K1 b - - 0 20

**Black to move. Legal moves:** d8d7, d8c7

**Material:**
- Black: King on d8, bishop on e6, pawns on a7, c6, d5, g6, h7
- White: Queen on f8, queen on d1, bishop on d3, bishop on e3, knight on e2, pawns on a2, b2, c2, g2, h2, king on g1, rook on a1

**Position:**
- Black is down a queen and a rook for a bishop and two pawns. White's pieces are extremely active, and Black's king is exposed.
- White threatens Qd6+ or Qf6+ with devastating effect.
- The only two legal moves are d8d7 and d8c7.

**Move analysis:**

1. **d8d7:** 
   - White can play Qg7+ or Qg8+ (mate in 1).
   - Qg7# is checkmate.

2. **d8c7:** 
   - White has Qe7+ followed by Qxe6 or Qxe6+ and then Qxe6.
   - Also, Qe7+ Kb6 (only move), Qb4+ Ka6, Qb5# is mate.
   - Or Qe7+ Kc8, Qxe6+ Kb7, Qd7+ Kb6, Qd8+ Kc5, b4+ Kc4, Qxc6#

But after d8c7, White has Qe7+ and then Qxe6, and Black is still lost.

**Conclusion:**
Both moves lose immediately, but d8c7 at least avoids immediate mate for one more move.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d8c7
```

2025-06-26 18:34:22,649 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.76s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/p1k1Q2p/2p1b1p1/3p4/8/3BB3/PPP1N1PP/R2Q2K1 b - - 2 21

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on c7, Bishop on e6, pawns on a7, c6, d5, g6, h7
- White: Queen on e7, Queen on d1, Bishop on d3, Bishop on e3, Knight on e2, pawns on a2, b2, c2, g2, h2, King on g1, Rook on a1

**Position:**
- Black is down a queen for a bishop and a pawn.
- White is threatening a lot: the queen on e7 is very powerful, and White has a huge material advantage.
- Black's king is exposed on c7.
- Only legal moves: c7c8, c7b8, e6d7

Let's analyze each move:

1. **c7c8** (King to c8)
   - White can play Ba6+ (bishop check), and after Kb8, Bf4+ wins the queen or mates soon.
   - White's attack is overwhelming.

2. **c7b8** (King to b8)
   - White has Bf4+ (bishop check), and after Ka8, Qe8+ is mate.

3. **e6d7** (Bishop to d7)
   - This blocks the d-file, so White cannot play Qd1-d7+ immediately.
   - But White can play Bf4+ (bishop check), and after Kc8, Ba6# is mate.

Let's check for any tricks:

- After e6d7, Bf4+ Kc8, Ba6# is mate.
- After c7b8, Bf4+ Ka8, Qe8# is mate.
- After c7c8, Ba6+ Kb8, Bf4+ Ka8, Qe8# is mate.

All moves lose immediately, but let's see if any move delays mate the longest.

- **e6d7**: Bf4+ Kc8 Ba6# (mate in 2)
- **c7b8**: Bf4+ Ka8 Qe8# (mate in 2)
- **c7c8**: Ba6+ Kb8 Bf4+ Ka8 Qe8# (mate in 3)

So, **c7c8** delays mate by one move compared to the others.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c7c8
```
