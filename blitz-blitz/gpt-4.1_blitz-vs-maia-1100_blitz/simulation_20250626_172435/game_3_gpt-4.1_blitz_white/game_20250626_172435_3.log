2025-06-26 17:46:39,624 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 3.91s):
Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of a chess game. As White, I have all standard opening moves available. The most popular and theoretically sound first moves are 1.e4 and 1.d4, both controlling the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop. Other options include 1.c4 (English Opening) and 1.Nf3 (Reti Opening), but 1.e4 and 1.d4 are generally considered best for fighting for an advantage.

Between 1.e4 and 1.d4, 1.e4 is slightly more aggressive and leads to open games, while 1.d4 often leads to more strategic, closed positions. For a critically urgent match where I want to press for a win and maximize my chances, 1.e4 is the most direct and challenging move.

Therefore, my move is:
```
e2e4
```

2025-06-26 17:47:31,249 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 4.24s):
Let's analyze the position:

- This is a Sicilian Defense: 1.e4 c5.
- White to move.
- All pieces are on their original squares except for the e4 pawn and c5 pawn.
- No threats yet, but development and central control are key.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf3**: Classical development, attacks e5, prepares for d4.
2. **Nc3**: Develops, supports d4, but blocks c-pawn.
3. **d4**: Immediate central break, but after cxd4, Qxd4 or Nf3 is possible.
4. **c3**: Prepares d4, Alapin variation.
5. **Bc4**: Develops bishop, eyes f7, but not the most common here.

**Analysis:**
- **Nf3** is the most flexible, classical, and safe. It develops a piece, controls the center, and prepares for d4.
- **Nc3** is also good, but usually Nf3 is preferred first to keep c-pawn flexible.
- **d4** is playable, but after cxd4, Nf3, Black can play Nc6 and equalize.
- **c3** is the Alapin, but usually played on move 2.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to develop the knight to f3, keeping options open and preparing for d4.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3

- White to move.
- Black has played a sort of hybrid between the Sicilian and the Philidor Defense.
- White has a strong center and development advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d2d4**: Immediate central break, challenging Black's c5 and d6 pawns. If cxd4, Nxd4 gives White a strong center and development.
2. **b1c3**: Develops a piece, supports d4 push, and increases pressure.
3. **f1c4**: Develops a bishop to an active square, eyes f7.
4. **f1b5+**: Check, but Black can block easily with Bd7 or Nc6.
5. **d2d3**: Solid, but less ambitious than d4.
6. **e4e5**: Gains space, but Black can respond with dxe5 or Nc6.

**Analysis:**
- **d2d4** is the most principled move, striking in the center and opening lines for development. After d4, if cxd4, Nxd4, White has a lead in development and central control.
- **b1c3** is also good, but less ambitious than d4.
- **f1c4** is fine, but d4 is more direct.

**Tactical considerations:**
- No immediate tactics for Black after d4.
- White keeps the initiative and can develop rapidly.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to strike in the center with d4.

2025-06-26 17:49:01,201 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.41s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4

- Black has just captured on d4 with the c5 pawn (c5xd4).
- White to move.

**Material:** Equal.
**Development:** Both sides have developed one knight. White has a slight lead in development (Nf3), and Black's queenside is undeveloped.
**Center:** Black has a pawn on d4, White has e4. White can recapture on d4.
**King Safety:** Both kings are safe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxd4**: Recaptures the pawn. Centralizes the knight. Opens lines for the bishop. Most natural.
2. **Qxd4**: Recaptures, but exposes the queen to Nc6 with tempo.
3. **c3**: Attacks the d4 pawn, but allows Black to exchange and leaves White with an isolated pawn.
4. **Bb5+**: Check, but Black can block with Bd7 or Nc6.
5. **Nf3-g5**: Threatens nothing immediate, and leaves d4 pawn.
6. **e4-e5**: Aggressive, but Black can play dxe5 or Nc6.

**Deep analysis:**

- **Nxd4**: If 4. Nxd4, Black can play Nf6, Nc6, or e5. After 4...Nf6, White can continue with Nc3, Nc3, or Bd3. White has a slight lead in development and central control.
- **Qxd4**: 4. Qxd4 Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6. White's queen is exposed, and Black gains tempo.
- **c3**: 4. c3 dxc3 5. Nxc3. White regains the pawn, but Black can play Nc6, and White's pawn structure is less flexible.
- **Bb5+**: 4. Bb5+ Bd7 5. Bxd7+ Qxd7. White hasn't solved the d4 pawn.

**Conclusion:** The most principled move is to recapture with the knight, developing a piece and maintaining central control.

**Final move:**
```
f3d4

Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 4...Nf6:**
- White: King e1, Queen d1, Rooks a1/h1, Bishops c1/f1, Knights d4/b1, Pawns a2/b2/c2/e4/f2/g2/h2
- Black: King e8, Queen d8, Rooks a8/h8, Bishops c8/f8, Knights f6/b8, Pawns a7/b7/d6/e7/f7/g7/h7

**Material:** Equal.

**Development:**
- White: Knight on d4 is active, e4 pawn controls center. All other pieces undeveloped.
- Black: Knight on f6, d6 pawn, rest undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nc3** - Develops a piece, supports d4, eyes b5/e4.
2. **Bd3/Bc4/Bb5** - Develops bishop, prepares to castle.
3. **f3** - Not necessary, weakens e3.
4. **Nc3** is the most natural, but let's check for tactics:
   - **Nb5** - Attacks d6, but Black can easily defend.
   - **e5** - Attacks the knight, but after dxe5, Nf3, Black is fine.
   - **Nf5** - Not threatening much.
   - **Qd3/Qf3** - Not urgent, development first.
   - **Bc4** - Develops, eyes f7, but Black can play e6.

**Best move:**
- **Nc3** develops a piece, supports the center, prepares for Be2/Bd3/Bc4 and castling.

**Final move:**

2025-06-26 17:50:44,647 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.39s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 5...g6:**
- White: King e1, Queen d1, Rooks a1/h1, Bishops c1/f1, Knights c3/d4, Pawns a2/b2/c2/d4/e4/f2/g2/h2
- Black: King e8, Queen d8, Rooks a8/h8, Bishops c8/f8, Knights b8/f6, Pawns a7/b7/d6/e7/f7/g6/h7

**Key features:**
- White has a strong center with pawns on e4 and d4, and both knights are developed.
- Black has played ...g6, likely preparing to fianchetto the bishop.
- No pieces have been exchanged yet except for the c/d pawns.
- White to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4-e6** (Knight fork): This attacks the queen and rook, but after ...Bxe6, White loses the knight for a bishop, and Black develops. Not optimal.
2. **c3-d5**: Centralizes the knight, attacks e7, and threatens to exchange on f6, but Black can play ...Nxd5, exd5, Bg7, and White has a space advantage.
3. **Bf1-c4**: Develops the bishop, eyes f7, and prepares to castle.
4. **Bf1-e2**: Prepares to castle, but less active than Bc4.
5. **d1-f3**: Develops the queen, eyes f7, but blocks the f-pawn.
6. **e4-e5**: Gains space, attacks the knight on f6, but Black can play ...dxe5, Nf3, Qxd1+, Kxd1, and White loses castling rights.
7. **h2-h3**: Prevents ...Ng4, but not urgent.

**Critical lines:**
- **Bc4** is a natural developing move, putting pressure on f7 and preparing to castle. It also keeps options open for a kingside attack.
- **Nd5** is tempting, but after ...Nxd5, exd5, Bg7, White has a space advantage but Black can challenge the center with ...Qb6 or ...Nd7.
- **e5** is premature, as Black can exchange and trade queens.

**Best move:**
- **Bc4** is the most principled, developing a piece, targeting f7, and keeping all options open. It also allows for quick castling and potential kingside pressure.

Therefore, my move is:
```
f1c4

2025-06-26 17:51:46,814 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 10.80s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 6...Bg7:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1/h1, Bishops on c4/c1, Knights on c3/d4, pawns on a2/b2/c2/e4/f2/g2/h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8/h8, Bishops on g7/c8, Knights on b8/f6, pawns on a7/b7/d6/e7/f7/g6/h7.

**White to move.**

**Key features:**
- White has more space, especially in the center.
- Both sides are uncastled, but White can castle kingside immediately.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped (Nb8, Bc8, Ra8).
- White's pieces are active, especially the c4 bishop and knights.
- No immediate tactical shots, but White can increase pressure.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e4-e5**: Attacks the f6 knight, gains space, but Black can respond with ...dxe5 or ...Ng4.
2. **O-O (e1g1)**: Safe, develops, prepares to bring rook to e1 or f1.
3. **d1-h5**: Queen sortie, eyeing f7, but Black can play ...e6 or ...Nxh5.
4. **c1-g5**: Develops bishop, pins f6 knight, but Black can play ...h6.
5. **c4-f7+**: Sacrifice, but after Kxf7, White doesn't have enough for the piece.
6. **d4-b5**: Knight jump, attacks c7, but Black can play ...a6.
7. **c3-d5**: Knight jump, attacks e7 and c7, but Black can play ...Nxd5, exd5, and then ...O-O.

**Deep analysis:**

- **e4-e5**: If ...dxe5, then Nf3, but Black is fine. If ...Ng4, then h3, but Black can play ...Nxe5.
- **O-O**: Safe, no weaknesses, keeps all threats alive, and prepares Re1.
- **c1-g5**: If ...h6, then Bh4, g5, Bg3, but Black gets space.
- **d1-h5**: If ...Nxh5, then Qxh5, but Black is not in trouble.
- **c3-d5**: If ...Nxd5, exd5, O-O, White has a space advantage but not much more.

**Best plan:**
- Castle kingside, then play Re1, h3, and possibly f4/e5, or develop the c1 bishop.
- Keep the initiative, don't rush.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to castle kingside, keeping all options open and ensuring king safety.

2025-06-26 17:53:22,927 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 10.95s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 7...O-O:**
- White: King on g1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishops on c4 and c1, Knights on c3 and d4, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on g8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and f8, Bishops on g7 and c8, Knights on b8 and f6, pawns on a7, b7, d6, e7, f7, g6, h7.

**Key features:**
- White has a strong center and more space.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped (Nb8, Bc8).
- White's pieces are well-placed for kingside or central action.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e4-e5**: Attacks the knight on f6, gains space, and opens the center. If ...dxe5, then Nf3 or Ndb5 with pressure.
2. **Ndb5**: Attacks d6, but Black can play a6.
3. **Bg5**: Pins the knight, but Black can play h6.
4. **f4**: Aggressive, but weakens e4.
5. **Be3**: Develops, but not urgent.
6. **Qe2**: Prepares f4 or f3, but not urgent.
7. **Nf3**: Retreats, but not necessary.
8. **h3**: Prevents ...Bg4, but not urgent.

**Tactical shots:**
- **Bxf7+**: After Kxf7, Ne6+ forks, but Black can play ...Bxe6 or ...Ke8, and White is down a piece for two pawns, not enough.
- **Ndb5**: If ...a6, then Nc3 back, not much gained.

**Best move:**
- **e4-e5** is the most principled: it attacks the knight, gains space, and opens lines while Black is behind in development.

Let's check the consequences:
- 8. e5 dxe5 (if ...Ne8, then e6 is strong)
- 9. Nf3 (or Ndb5) with pressure on e5 and d6.

Alternatively, if 8...Ne8, then 9. e6 fxe6 10. Nxe6 Bxe6 11. Bxe6+ Kh8 12. Nd5, White is very active.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e4e5

2025-06-26 17:54:17,118 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 9.35s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 9...e5:**

- White: King on g1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishops on c4 and d4, Knights on c3 and d4, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on g8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and f8, Bishops on g7 and c8, Knight on f6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, g6, f7, h7.

**Key features:**
- White has a strong center and more space.
- Black's e5 pawn is advanced, but White's pieces are very active.
- The c4 bishop and d4 knight are well-placed.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bxf7+** (c4f7): Sacrificing the bishop for a direct attack. If Kxf7, then Ndb5 or Nf3-g5+ ideas. But after Rxf7, White may not have enough compensation.
2. **Ndb5** (c3b5): Threatening Nc7 fork, but Black can play Na6 or exd4.
3. **Nf3** (d4f3): Retreat, but passive.
4. **Nxc6** (d4c6): Captures a pawn, but after bxc6, Black's pawn structure is weakened, and White can play Qxd8 Rxd8, then Bg5.
5. **Bxe5** (c4e5): Captures the pawn, but Black can play Nxe4.
6. **Qd3** (d1d3): Prepares to swing the queen to the kingside, but not very forcing.
7. **Nb3** (c3b5): Not very threatening.

**Tactical shots:**
- **Bxf7+** is tempting, but after Rxf7, White doesn't have a clear follow-up.
- **Nxc6** (d4c6) is interesting: bxc6, Qxd8 Rxd8, Bg5. White has a slight lead in development and Black's pawn structure is damaged.

**Calculation of Nxc6:**
1. d4c6 bxc6
2. Qxd8 Rxd8
3. Bg5

Now, Black's knight on f6 is pinned, and White threatens to play Rad1, putting more pressure. Black's bishop on c8 is still undeveloped.

Alternatively, after d4c6, Black could play Qxd1, but after Rfxd1, White is still better.

**Evaluation:**
- Nxc6 is a safe move that damages Black's pawn structure and gives White a long-term advantage.
- No immediate tactics seem to work better.

**Final move:**
```
d4c6
```

2025-06-26 17:55:34,971 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.39s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 10...Nc6:**
- White: King on g1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c4, Knight on c3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on g8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and f8, Bishop on g7, Knight on c6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g6, h7.

**Key features:**
- White has a slight lead in development, with both bishops and knights out, and king castled.
- Black's e5 pawn is slightly weak, but not immediately attackable.
- The c4 bishop is well-placed, eyeing f7 and b7.
- The c3 knight can jump to d5, pressuring Black's pieces.
- The d1 queen has open lines to d5, h5, and g4.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nc3-d5**: Centralizes the knight, attacks e7 and c7, threatens Nxf6+ if Black is careless.
2. **Bc4-f7+**: Sacrifices the bishop for two pawns and exposes Black's king, but after Rxf7, White doesn't have enough compensation.
3. **Qd1-d6**: Attacks the e5 pawn, but Black can defend with Qe7 or Re8.
4. **Qd1-h5**: Threatens Qxh7#, but Black can play g6 or h6.
5. **Bc1-g5**: Develops the bishop, pins the knight on f6, but Black can play h6.
6. **Bc4-e6**: Forces Black to decide between fxe6 (weakening the pawn structure) or Bxe6 (trading bishops).

**Deep analysis:**
- **Nd5** is very strong. It attacks c7 and e7, and if Black plays Nxd5, Bxd5 keeps pressure on the e7 pawn and opens the c-file for the rook.
- **Bc4-f7+** is not sound; after Rxf7, White doesn't have enough for the piece.
- **Qd1-h5** is tempting, but Black can easily defend.
- **Bc4-e6** is interesting, but after fxe6, White doesn't have a clear follow-up.

**Best move:**
- **Nd5** is the most principled: it centralizes the knight, attacks key squares, and increases pressure.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-26 17:56:27,165 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 10.43s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 10...Be6:**

- White: King on g1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c4 and c1, Knights are gone, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on g8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and f8, Bishop on e6 and g7, Knight on f6, pawns on a7, b7, c6, e7, f7, g6, h7.

**White to move.**

**Key features:**
- White has a bishop on c4, which is active.
- Black has just played ...Be6, attacking the bishop on c4.
- White's knight on d5 is very strong, centralized, and cannot be attacked by a pawn.
- Black's kingside is somewhat weakened by the move g6.
- White has potential for pressure on the kingside and center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxe7+**: Knight takes on e7 with check. If ...Qxe7, then Bxe6, fxe6, and White has exchanged pieces, but Black's pawn structure is damaged.
2. **Nf4**: Knight attacks e6 bishop and g6 pawn.
3. **Bb3**: Retreats the bishop, keeping it on the a2-g8 diagonal.
4. **d4**: Not possible, as there is no pawn on d4.
5. **Qf3**: Developing the queen, eyeing f6 and b7.
6. **Re1**: Centralizing the rook.

**Let's calculate Nxe7+:**
- 11. Nxe7+ Qxe7 (if ...Nxe7, then Bxe6 fxe6, White has damaged Black's pawn structure)
- 12. Bxe6 Qxe6 (if ...fxe6, then d3-d4 is coming, and Black's pawn structure is ugly)
- White has exchanged a pair of minor pieces and forced Black to recapture with the queen or pawn.

**What about Nf4?**
- 11. Nf4 Bxc4 (Black can take on c4)
- 12. Qxd8 Raxd8
- White has lost the bishop pair, but has a knight on f4.

**What about Bb3?**
- 11. Bb3 Nxd5 (Black can take on d5)
- 12. exd5 Bxd5
- Black gets the bishop pair and a good center.

**What about Qf3?**
- 11. Qf3 Ne5 (attacks the queen and bishop)
- 12. Qe2 Nxc4
- White loses the bishop pair.

**What about Bxe6?**
- 11. Bxe6 fxe6
- 12. Nxf6+ Bxf6
- 13. d3
- White has given up the bishop pair, but Black's pawn structure is damaged.

**Summary:**
- Nxe7+ is the most forcing move, and damages Black's pawn structure if Black recaptures with the pawn.
- If Black recaptures with the queen, White can exchange bishops on e6, and Black's queen is somewhat misplaced.

**Let's check the line:**
11. Nxe7+ Qxe7
12. Bxe6 Qxe6 (if ...fxe6, then d3-d4 is coming, and Black's pawn structure is ugly)
13. d3 (solidifying center, preparing Be3, Qe2, etc.)

Alternatively, after 11. Nxe7+ Nxe7 12. Bxe6 fxe6, Black's kingside pawns are weak.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
d5e7
```

2025-06-26 17:57:02,338 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.62s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r4rk1/pp2qpbp/2n1bnp1/4p3/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12

**White to move.**

**Material:** Equal.  
**King safety:** Both kings are castled kingside.  
**Development:** Both sides are developed, but Black's pieces are a bit more active.  
**Center:** Black has a pawn on e5, but White has more space on the queenside.

**Key features:**
- Black's bishop on e6 and knight on f6 are well-placed.
- White's bishop on c4 is active, eyeing e6 and b7.
- Black's queen on e7 is centralized.
- White's queen and rook are on the first rank, ready to be activated.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bxe6** (c4e6): Captures the bishop, but after Qxe6, Black's queen is more active.
2. **Ba6** (c4a6): Attacks the rook on a8, but Black can play bxa6 or Rfd8.
3. **Qd6** (d1d6): Centralizes the queen, attacks the knight, and eyes the kingside.
4. **Qe2** (d1e2): Connects rooks, but not very active.
5. **Bg5** (c1g5): Pins the knight, but Black can play h6.
6. **Bb5** (c4b5): Attacks the knight on c6, but Black can play Rfd8 or Qc7.
7. **Qd5** (d1d5): Attacks the bishop on e6 and the knight on c6, but Black can play Nxd5.

**Deep analysis:**

- **Bxe6 Qxe6**: Black's queen is centralized, but White has exchanged a strong bishop for a strong bishop. Not clearly better for White.
- **Ba6**: If ...bxa6, White can play Qd6, attacking the knight and threatening Qxc6. If ...Rfd8, then Qe2, and White can double rooks on the d-file.
- **Qd6**: Attacks the knight and threatens Bxe6. If ...Qxd6, then Bxd6, and White has a bishop pair and a slight initiative.
- **Qd5**: If ...Nxd5, then Bxd5, and White has a bishop pair and pressure on b7.

**Best move:**

**Qd6** is very strong: it attacks the knight on c6, threatens Bxe6, and if Black exchanges queens, White gets the bishop pair and a slight initiative. If Black plays ...Qxd6, Bxd6, White's bishop is very strong on d6, and the rook can come to d1.

Therefore, after careful consideration, the best move is:

```
d1d6
```

2025-06-26 17:58:03,742 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 14.27s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 13...Qd6:**

- White: King on g1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c4, Bishop on c1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on g8, Rooks on a8 and f8, Bishop on g7, Bishop on e6, Knight on f6, Knight on c6, Queen on d6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, g6, h7.

**Material:** Equal.

**Positional factors:**
- Black's pieces are well-coordinated, but White has more space and the bishop pair.
- Black's queen is centralized but could be a target.
- White's light-squared bishop is active on c4, eyeing e6 and potentially a6.
- White's king is safe, but development is not yet complete (rook on a1, bishop on c1).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bxe6** (c4e6): Exchange bishop for bishop, but after Qxe6, Black's queen is more active.
2. **Ba6** (c4a6): Attacks the rook on a8, but Black can play Qc7 or Qe7, defending.
3. **Bb5** (c4b5): Pins the knight on c6 to the queen, but Black can play Qc7 or Qe7.
4. **Bd3** (c4d3): Retreat, not active.
5. **Bb3** (c4b3): Retreat, not active.
6. **Be2** (c4e2): Retreat, not active.
7. **h3**: Useful waiting move, but not urgent.
8. **Re1** (f1e1): Develops rook, connects rooks, and prepares for central play.
9. **Bg5** (c1g5): Develops bishop, attacks the knight on f6, but Black can play h6.
10. **Bf4** (c1f4): Develops bishop, attacks the queen, but Black can play Qe7 or Qc7.

**Deeper analysis:**

- **Ba6** (c4a6): If 14.Ba6 Qc7 (or Qe7), then White has forced the queen off the d-file, but not much more.
- **Bb5** (c4b5): If 14.Bb5 Qc7, then White can consider Qd6xd6, cxd6, and then Rd1, but Black's center is strong.
- **Re1** (f1e1): Prepares to bring the rook to the center and supports e4-e5 in the future.
- **Bg5** (c1g5): If 14.Bg5 h6 15.Bxf6 Bxf6, Black's bishop pair is strong, but White loses the bishop pair.

**Best move:**

- **Bb5** (c4b5) is interesting because it pins the knight and indirectly pressures the queen. If Black plays Qc7, White can consider Bxc6, Qxc6, and then Qxd6, cxd6, and Rd1, targeting the isolated d-pawn.
- **Ba6** (c4a6) is also tempting, but after Qc7, the bishop is a bit awkward.
- **Re1** is solid, but not pressing the initiative.

**Conclusion:**
The most active and pressing move is **Bb5** (c4b5), pinning the knight and preparing to double Black's pawns if possible.

My move:
```
c4b5
```

2025-06-26 17:59:38,456 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.94s):
Let's analyze the position step by step:

**Position after Black's last move (14...Nd4):**

- Black's pieces:
  - Queen on d6
  - Bishop on e6 and g7
  - Knight on d4 and f6
  - Rooks on a8 and f8
  - Pawns: a7, b7, e5, f7, g6, h7

- White's pieces:
  - Bishop on b5
  - Queen is gone
  - Knight is gone
  - Rooks on a1 and f1
  - Bishop on c1
  - Pawns: a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2

**Black's threats:**
- The knight on d4 is very strong, centralized, and supported by the queen.
- The queen and bishop battery on the dark squares is dangerous.
- Black is threatening ...Nxe4, forking the bishop and pawn.

**White's options:**
- The bishop on b5 is attacked by the knight, but not directly.
- The bishop on c1 is undeveloped.
- White's king is relatively safe, but Black has more activity.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5e8** (Bxe8): Captures the rook, but after ...Ne2+ and ...Nxe8, Black regains the exchange and keeps the initiative.
2. **b5d7** (Bxd7): Captures the bishop, but after ...Qxd7, Black keeps the center and activity.
3. **b5c4** (Bxc4): Retreats, but loses momentum.
4. **c1g5** (Bg5): Develops, attacks the knight on f6.
5. **c1e3** (Be3): Develops, attacks the knight on d4.
6. **f1d1** (Rd1): Puts pressure on the queen and knight.
7. **h2h3**: Gives luft, but is slow.

**Tactical considerations:**
- If Bxe8, Black plays ...Ne2+ (fork), and after Kh1, ...Nxe8, Black regains the exchange and is better.
- If Bxd7, Qxd7, Black keeps the bishop pair and central control.
- If Bg5, Black can play ...Nxe4, and after Bxd8, Raxd8, Black is still active.
- If Be3, attacks the knight, but Black can play ...Nxb5, winning a pawn.

**Best move:**
- **Bxd7** (b5d7) seems to be the best practical move. It exchanges one of Black's active bishops, reduces Black's attacking potential, and develops the c1 bishop next. After Qxd7, White can play c3, challenging the knight on d4.

Therefore, my move is:
```
b5d7
```

2025-06-26 18:00:49,257 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 15.38s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r4rk1/pp1q1pbp/4bnp1/4p3/3n4/8/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 15

**Material:**
- White: Rooks on a1, f1; Bishop on c1; pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2; King on g1.
- Black: Rooks on a8, f8; Bishop on e6; Bishop on g7; Queen is off the board; pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g6, h7; Knights on d4, f6; King on g8.

**Imbalances:**
- Black has a bishop pair and two knights centralized.
- White has a bishop and two rooks, but is cramped and behind in development.
- Black's pieces are very active and control the center.
- White's king is relatively safe, but Black has a lot of pressure.

**Candidate moves:**
- Develop the bishop: c1g5, c1h6, c1f4, c1e3, c1d2
- Rook moves: f1e1, f1d1, a1b1
- Pawn moves: h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4

**Tactical considerations:**
- Black's knight on d4 is very strong.
- White's bishop on c1 is undeveloped.
- Black threatens ...Nxc2, forking rook and bishop.
- If White plays c3, Black can play ...Ne2+ forking king and rook.
- If White plays Be3, Black can play ...Nxc2, forking rook and bishop.

**Best plan:**
- Defend c2 and develop the bishop.
- c3 is risky due to ...Ne2+.
- Bishop moves like Bg5 or Bh6 don't address the threat of ...Nxc2.
- Rook to d1 or e1 doesn't help with the c2 threat.
- b3 defends c2, but weakens the queenside and allows ...Nxc2, Rb1, Nxa1, Rxa1, which loses the exchange.

**Critical calculation:**
- If White plays c1e3, Black plays Nxc2, White plays Rac1, Black plays Nxe3, fxe3, and White has lost a pawn and the bishop pair.
- If White plays c1d2, Black plays Nxc2, White plays Rac1, Black plays Nxa1, Rxa1, again losing the exchange.
- If White plays f2f3, Black plays Nxc2, and White cannot recapture.

**Is there a way to avoid losing material?**
- White is in a tough spot. The best way to avoid immediate loss is to play a rook move to defend c2, but neither rook can get there in one move.

**What about h2h3?**
- It gives the king luft, but doesn't address the c2 threat.

**What about c2c3?**
- Black plays Ne2+, Kh1, Nxc1, Raxc1, and White loses the exchange.

**What about a2a4?**
- Doesn't help.

**What about c1g5?**
- Develops the bishop, but doesn't address the c2 threat.

**What about f2f3?**
- Doesn't help.

**What about c1e3?**
- After Nxc2, Rac1, Nxe3, fxe3, White is down a pawn and the bishop pair, but at least not the exchange.

**Conclusion:**
- The least bad is to play c1e3, allowing Nxc2, Rac1, Nxe3, fxe3. White is down a pawn and the bishop pair, but not the exchange. All other moves lose more material.

**Final move:**
```
c1e3
```

**FEN:** r4rk1/pp1q1pbp/4bnp1/4p3/8/4B3/PPn2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 16

- Black's last move was ...Nc2, attacking the rook on a1 and threatening to fork on e3 if the bishop moves.
- White's bishop on e3 is attacked by the knight on c2, but not directly.
- Black's pieces are active, but White's position is not lost.
- White's rook on a1 is attacked by the knight on c2.
- White's bishop on e3 is well placed, but the knight on c2 is very annoying.

   - Moving the bishop allows Nc2xa1, losing the exchange.
4. **Pawn moves:** h3, g3, f3, b3, a3, h4, g4, f4, b4, a4
   - Not urgent, as the rook is hanging.

If we move the bishop, we lose the rook on a1. So, we must defend or move the rook.

**Rook moves:**
- a1e1, a1d1, a1c1, a1b1
- f1e1, f1d1, f1c1, f1b1
- g1h1

**Best move:**
- **a1c1**: This move saves the rook, contests the c-file, and keeps the bishop on e3 defended. It also indirectly threatens to play Rxc2 if Black's knight is not defended.

**Tactical check:**
- If 16. a1c1, Black cannot take on e3 because the knight is not attacking e3.
- If 16...Nxe3, then fxe3, and White is fine.
- If 16...Nxa1, the rook is not on a1 anymore.
- If 16...Qxc7, White can play Rxc2, winning the knight.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to save the rook and play a1c1.

```
a1c1

2025-06-26 18:03:20,903 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.50s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (c1), Rook (f1), Bishop (e3), 6 pawns
- Black: Rook (a8), Rook (f8), Bishop (g7), Bishop (e6), Knight (e3), Queen (d7), 6 pawns

**King Safety:**
- White's king is on g1, relatively safe.
- Black's king is on g8, also safe.

**Piece Activity:**
- Black's knight on e3 is very strong, attacking f1 and g2.
- Black's queen, bishops, and rooks are well placed.
- White's rook on c1 is active, but the bishop on e3 is under attack by the knight.
- White's f1 rook is passive.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens Nxf1, forking the king and rook.
- White's bishop on e3 is attacked and cannot move without losing the rook on f1.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. f2xe3: Recaptures the knight, but after Qxd1, Rfxd1, Black is up the exchange.
2. f2f3: Defends the e3 bishop, but Black can play Nxf1, Rxf1, Qxd1, Rfxd1, Bxa2, and Black is up a pawn.
3. f2f4: Attacks the bishop on e5, but Nxf1 is still a problem.
4. Rfd1: Defends the bishop, but Nxd1, Rfxd1, Qxd1+, Rxd1, Nxd1, and Black is up a piece.
5. Rfe1: Defends the bishop, but Nxf1, Rxf1, Qxd1, Rfxd1, Bxa2, Black is up a pawn.

**Best Move:**
The only way to not lose material immediately is to recapture the knight with f2xe3. After fxe3, Black can play Qxd1, Rfxd1, and the position is roughly equal in material, but Black has the bishop pair and a slightly better pawn structure.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f2e3
```

2025-06-26 18:04:36,514 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.32s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rooks on c1 and f1, pawns on a2, b2, e3, g2, h2, King on g1.
- Black: Rooks on c8 and f8, Queen on d7, Bishop on e6, Bishop on g7, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f6, g6, h7, King on g8.

**Imbalances:**
- Black has the bishop pair and a strong center.
- White is down a pawn.
- Black's pieces are more active, but White's rooks are ready to contest open files.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens ...Rxc1, but White can recapture.
- Black's bishop on e6 is strong, but not immediately threatening.
- No immediate mate threats for either side.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c1xc8**: Exchange rooks. After ...Qxc8, Black's queen is more active, but White relieves some pressure.
2. **f1xf6**: Sacrifices the exchange for two pawns and opens the g-file, but after ...Bxf6, Black's bishop pair dominates.
3. **e3e4**: Challenges the center, but after ...exd4, White's structure is weakened.
4. **h2h3**: Luft for the king, but not urgent.
5. **g2g3**: Similar to h3, but weakens dark squares.
6. **f1f2**: Doubles rooks, but passive.

**Deeper look at c1xc8:**
- c1xc8 Rxc8
- f1xf6 Bxf6
- Now White has exchanged a pair of rooks and can try to play for e4 or h3.

Alternatively, if White plays **e3e4**:
- e3e4 exd4
- exd4 Qxd4+
- Qxd4 exd4
- White's pawn structure is weak, and Black's bishop pair is strong.

**Best move:**
- Exchanging a pair of rooks with **c1xc8** reduces Black's attacking potential and simplifies the position, which is good when down material and under pressure.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c1c8
```

2025-06-26 18:05:23,637 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.94s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (f1), King (g1), pawns on a2, b2, e3, g2, h2
- Black: Rook (c8), Bishop (e6, g7), Knight (f6), pawns on a7, b7, e5, g6, h7, Queen (d7), King (g8)

**Imbalances:**
- Black has a queen for a rook and pawn (material advantage).
- White's king is relatively safe for now, but Black's pieces are active.
- White's rook is on f1, not very active.
- Black threatens ...Qd2, attacking e3 and possibly g2.
- White's e3 pawn is under threat.
- White has no immediate tactical threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e3e4**: Pushes the pawn, attacks the bishop, but after ...Qxd1 Rxd1, Black is still up material and keeps the initiative.
2. **f1f2**: Defends e3, but is passive.
3. **f1f3**: Defends e3, but allows ...Bg4.
4. **h2h3**: Prevents ...Ng4 or ...Bg4, but does not address the threat to e3.
5. **g2g3**: Prepares to fianchetto bishop, but again, e3 is hanging.
6. **f1f5**: Active rook, attacks e5, but ...gxf5, exf5, Bxf5, and White is down more material.
7. **f1f4**: Attacks e4, but does not help.

**Critical threat:** Black is threatening ...Qd2, attacking e3 and g2.

**Best defense:** Defend the e3 pawn, ideally with a rook move.

- **f1f2**: Defends e3, keeps the rook on the second rank, and prepares to double on the f-file if needed. It's passive, but necessary to avoid losing more material immediately.

**Other moves** like e3e4 lose a pawn after ...Qxd1 Rxd1 Nxe4, and Black is up a queen for a rook and two pawns, which is not enough compensation.

**Final move:**
```
f1f2
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 6k1/pp1q1pbp/4bnp1/4p3/8/4P3/PP3RPP/2r3K1 w - - 2 20

**White to move. Legal move:** f2f1

**Material:**
- White: King (g1), Rook (f2), pawns (a2, b2, e3, g2, h2)
- Black: King (g8), Rook (c1), Bishop (e6), Bishop (g7), Queen (d7), pawns (a7, b7, e5, f6, g6, h7)

**Position:**
- White is down significant material (Queen and two Bishops for a Rook).
- White's only legal move is f2f1 (Rook to f1).

**Analysis:**
- White is in a dire situation, with only one legal move.
- After f2f1, Black will likely continue with Qd2 (threatening mate on g2), or Rc2, or Bh6, etc.
- White's king is exposed, and Black's pieces are dominating.
- There are no tactics or tricks available; survival is the only hope.

**Conclusion:**
- The only legal move is f2f1.

My move:
```
f2f1
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-26 18:05:36,367 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 3.77s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 6k1/pp3pbp/4bnp1/4p3/8/4P3/PP4PP/3q1K2 w - - 1 22

**White to move. Legal move:** f1f2

**Material count:**
- White: King on f1, pawns on a2, b2, e3, g2, h2
- Black: King on g8, queen on d1, bishop on e6, bishop on g7, knight on f6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, g6, h7

**Position assessment:**
- White is down a queen and a bishop for almost nothing (just pawns).
- Black's pieces are very active, and White's king is exposed.
- The only legal move is f1f2 (King moves to f2).

**Analysis:**
- After f1f2, Black will likely play ...Ng4+ or ...Ne4+ or ...Qd2+ or ...Qh1, all of which are devastating.
- There are no other legal moves for White.

**Conclusion:**
- The only move is f1f2.

Final move:
```
f1f2
```
