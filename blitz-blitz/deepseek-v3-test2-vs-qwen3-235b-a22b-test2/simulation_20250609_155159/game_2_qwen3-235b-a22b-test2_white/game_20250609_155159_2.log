2025-06-09 17:26:48,110 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 17.15s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. The FEN shows it's Black's move after White played e2-e4 (King's Pawn opening). Black has all pieces in their starting positions.

2. The most principled responses for Black in this position are:
   - e7-e5 (mirroring White's center control)
   - g8-f6 (developing knight while attacking e4 pawn)
   - d7-d5 (immediate counter in center)
   - c7-c5 (Sicilian-style response)

3. Evaluating the options:
   - e7e5: Classical symmetrical response, leads to open positions
   - g8f6: More hypermodern approach, puts pressure on e4
   - d7d5: Aggressive but leaves e4 pawn undefended after dxe4
   - c7c5: Transposes into Sicilian lines if White plays d4 next

4. The move g8f6 (Nf6) is particularly attractive because:
   - Develops a knight to its most natural square
   - Puts immediate pressure on White's e4 pawn
   - Doesn't commit to a pawn structure yet
   - Prepares for possible future d7-d5 push
   - Maintains flexibility for Black's position

5. Other moves like e7e5 are also good, but Nf6 is more flexible and leads to more complex positions where Black can fight for the initiative.

After considering these factors, the best move appears to be:

```
g8f6
```

2025-06-09 17:27:50,889 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 16.00s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. The FEN shows it's Black's move (b) after 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5. White has pushed their pawn to e5, attacking the f6 knight.

2. Black's knight on f6 is under attack and must be dealt with. We have several options:
   - Retreat the knight (f6g8, f6h5, f6d5, f6e4, f6g4)
   - Defend the knight (developing b8c6 or b8a6)
   - Push pawns to challenge the center (d7d5 or e7e6)

3. Key considerations:
   - f6g8 is passive and blocks the rook
   - f6d5 looks interesting but leaves the knight exposed
   - f6e4 seems risky as the knight could be trapped
   - Developing with b8c6 is principled but allows 3.exf6
   - d7d5 is the most challenging, fighting for the center

4. After 2...d5:
   - If 3.exd6 e.p., then 3...Qxd6 and Black has good development
   - If 3.Nc3, then 3...dxe4 with active play
   - It maintains the tension and challenges White's center

5. Other moves either concede space or lead to passive positions. d7d5 is the most dynamic and principled response.

After careful consideration, the best move is:

```
d7d5
```

2025-06-09 17:29:05,821 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 15.71s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current position features:
- White has just captured a pawn on d6 with their pawn (d5xd6), leaving a white pawn on d6
- Black's king is still in the starting position (e8)
- Black has development issues with the bishop on c8 and knight on b8
- White has a strong pawn on d6 that could become dangerous if not addressed

Key observations:
1. The pawn on d6 is threatening to advance and potentially promote
2. Black needs to deal with this pawn while also developing pieces
3. The knight on f6 is pinned to the king by the pawn on d6

Best candidate moves to consider:
1. f6d5 - Capturing the pawn immediately with the knight
   - But this loses the knight to d6xd5
2. c8d7 - Developing the bishop while defending d5 square
   - But doesn't directly address the pawn
3. e7d6 - Capturing with the pawn
   - This seems most logical as it eliminates the dangerous pawn
   - After exd6, White would likely recapture with cxd6, but this opens the e-file for Black's rook

After considering all options, e7d6 is the most forcing move that deals with the immediate threat while opening development possibilities. Other moves either ignore the threat or lose material.

```

2025-06-09 17:30:11,678 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 19.25s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. First, let's understand the position:
   - It's Black's turn (b in FEN)
   - White has played d4 (seen by the pawn on d4 and Black's pawn was on d6)
   - Black has developed Nf6 and has most pieces still on their starting squares
   - White has only moved the d-pawn, with other pieces still in initial positions

2. Key features to consider:
   - White's d4 pawn is unprotected and could be a target
   - Black's light-squared bishop is blocked by the d6 pawn
   - Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)
   - The f6 knight is well-placed and could pressure d5 or e4

3. Candidate moves worth considering:
   - f6d5: Knight takes the unprotected d4 pawn - but after dxd5 Qxd5, Nc3 would attack the queen
   - d6d5: Pawn push to challenge the center - but this seems premature
   - f6e4: Knight jump to e4 - but it could be kicked away by f3
   - c7c5: Pawn break to challenge the center - this seems thematic
   - Developing moves like b8c6 or c8g4

4. Best options seem to be:
   - c7c5: Immediate counter in the center, challenging White's pawn structure
   - f6d5: Tactical shot, though it gives up the knight for two pawns after dxd5 Qxd5 Nc3

After considering these, c7c5 seems most principled:
- It fights for central control
- Opens lines for Black's pieces
- Follows standard opening principles
- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses

The tactical f6d5 is tempting but seems too early and gives White active play after the exchanges.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c7c5
```

2025-06-09 17:31:29,601 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 15.81s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. The position shows Black has just played (indicated by "b" in the FEN) and White has pushed their d-pawn to d5, creating a passed pawn.

2. Black's main strategic considerations:
   - The d5 pawn is passed and potentially dangerous
   - Black needs to complete development
   - Black's king is still in the center
   - The c5 pawn is under pressure from White's potential b4 push

3. Candidate moves worth considering:
   - c5c4: Prevents White's b4 and supports the d5 pawn blockade
   - f6d5: Capturing the passed pawn immediately
   - b8c6: Developing the knight with tempo on d5
   - f8e7: Simple development

4. After deeper analysis:
   - f6d5 looks tempting but after exd5, Black's pawn structure is compromised
   - b8c6 is met by d5xc6 when Black's pawn structure becomes weak
   - c5c4 is solid but somewhat passive
   - f8e7 is safe but doesn't address the d5 pawn

5. The best move appears to be f6d5, accepting the structural weaknesses to eliminate the dangerous passed pawn. After:
   - f6d5 exd5
   - Black can follow up with f8e7 or c8e6 to develop pieces

The structural weaknesses are manageable and eliminating White's central passed pawn is worth it.
