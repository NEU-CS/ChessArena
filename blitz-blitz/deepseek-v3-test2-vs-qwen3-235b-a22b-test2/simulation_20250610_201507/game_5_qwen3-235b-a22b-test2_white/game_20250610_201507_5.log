2025-06-10 21:40:46,708 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 15.48s):
Let me analyze the position and consider the best move for Black.

Current position analysis:
1. This is the starting position after White has played 1.e4 (King's Pawn opening).
2. Black has several reasonable options to respond.
3. The most common and principled responses are:
   - e7e5 (mirroring White's center control)
   - g8f6 (developing a knight and attacking e4)
   - c7c5 (Sicilian Defense)
   - e7e6 (preparing for French Defense)

Candidate moves worth considering:
1. e7e5 - Classical approach, fights for center immediately. Leads to open games.
2. g8f6 - Alekhine's Defense, provoking White to push pawns.
3. c7c5 - Sicilian Defense, most popular and aggressive response.
4. d7d5 - Center Counter, immediately challenging e4.

Best choice:
- e7e5 is the most classical and symmetrical response, leading to balanced positions.
- It develops Black's pieces naturally while fighting for central control.
- This move maintains flexibility for Black's development (knight to f6 or c6, bishop to c5 or b4).

Other moves like g8f6 are playable but more provocative, while c7c5 leads to more complex Sicilian positions which might be too ambitious for beginners.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e7e5
```
