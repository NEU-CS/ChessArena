2025-06-10 21:41:59,767 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 14.27s):
Let me analyze the position and consider the best move for Black.

Current position analysis:
1. White has played 1. e4 (pawn to e4), a common opening move.
2. Black has several reasonable responses, with the main options being:
   - Developing the knight (Nf6 or Nc6)
   - Pushing a central pawn (e5 or d5)
   - Playing a hypermodern approach with g6 or b6

Candidate moves to consider:
1. e7e5 (e5) - Directly challenges White's center, leading to open classical games
2. g8f6 (Nf6) - Developing the knight to attack e4, common in Alekhine's Defense
3. d7d5 (d5) - Immediate counter in the center, transposing to Scandinavian-like positions
4. g7g6 (g6) - Preparing fianchetto, more hypermodern approach

Evaluation:
- e5 is the most classical response, leading to open games
- Nf6 is more provocative, allowing White to push e5
- d5 is playable but gives up the center after exd5
- g6 is solid but less direct

Best choice:
I believe e7e5 is the most principled move here, directly challenging White's center and leading to classical open game positions. It develops Black's game naturally and maintains symmetry in the center.
