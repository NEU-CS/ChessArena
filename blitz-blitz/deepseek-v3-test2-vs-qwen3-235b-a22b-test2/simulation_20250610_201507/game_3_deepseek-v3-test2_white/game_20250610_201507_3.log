2025-06-10 21:17:55,788 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 15.49s):
Let me analyze the position and candidate moves:

This is the starting position of a chess game (standard initial position). As White, I have several reasonable first move options to consider:

1. Pawn moves (e2e4, d2d4, c2c4, etc.):
   - e2e4 (King's Pawn) - Opens diagonals for bishop/queen, controls center
   - d2d4 (Queen's Pawn) - Solid center control, but slightly more committal
   - Other pawn moves are less ambitious in center control

2. Knight moves (g1f3, b1c3):
   - g1f3 - Develops knight toward center, doesn't block pawns
   - b1c3 - Also develops knight but blocks c-pawn

3. Other moves are either less common or less effective in the opening.

Between the top candidates:
- e2e4 is the most popular and aggressive, immediately fighting for center space
- d2d4 is solid but leads to different types of positions
- g1f3 is flexible but doesn't fight for center as directly

The move e2e4 offers the most active play and follows classical opening principles best. It opens lines for both the queen and bishop while controlling important central squares.

After considering these factors, the best move is:

```
e2e4
```

2025-06-10 21:18:53,288 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 17.40s):
Let me analyze the position and consider the candidate moves:

1. The position is after 1.e4 e5 (White played e4, Black responded with e5). It's White's turn now.

2. Key features of the position:
   - Open e-file with pawns facing each other
   - Both sides have all pieces developed
   - White has more space in the center
   - Black's e5 pawn is a potential target

3. Main strategic considerations:
   - Develop minor pieces (knights before bishops usually)
   - Control the center
   - Prepare for castling
   - Consider attacking the e5 pawn

4. Candidate moves worth considering:
   - Nf3 (g1f3): Develops knight, attacks e5 pawn, prepares castling
   - Nc3 (b1c3): Develops knight, supports d5 push
   - Bc4 (f1c4): Develops bishop to active diagonal
   - d3 (d2d3): Solidifies center but less active

5. Best moves seem to be between Nf3 and Nc3. Nf3 is more standard here as it immediately pressures e5 and develops towards castling. Nc3 is also good but doesn't create immediate threats.

6. Other moves like Bc4 are playable but less precise as Black could respond with Nf6 attacking the e4 pawn.

After considering these factors, the most principled move is Nf3 (g1f3), developing the knight with tempo against e5 and preparing kingside castling.

2025-06-10 21:19:39,575 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-10 21:19:59,634 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3-test2) (took 20.06s):
Let me analyze the position and candidate moves carefully.

Current position analysis:
- White has a slight space advantage with the e4 pawn.
- Black's knight on f6 is pinned to the queen (if it moves, Qxd8+ wins the queen).
- White's knight on f3 is well-placed, attacking e5 pawn and controlling key squares.
- Both sides have castling rights remaining.

Candidate move considerations:
1. Knight moves (f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, f3d4):
   - f3e5 looks tempting to win the pawn, but after ...Nxe5 dxe5 Qxd1+ Kxd1, Black gets some compensation
   - f3g5 threatens Nxe5 next move, but Black can defend with ...h6
   - f3d4 is solid but doesn't accomplish much

2. Bishop moves (f1a6, f1b5, f1c4, f1d3, f1e2):
   - f1b5+ is interesting, developing with check, but after ...c6 we have to retreat
   - f1c4 is a good developing move, eyeing f7 weakness

3. Pawn moves:
   - d2d4 is thematic, opening the center and gaining more space
   - h2h4/g2g4 are too committal this early
   - a2a4/b2b4/c2c4 are possible but not critical

4. Castling preparation:
   - e1e2 is possible but awkward
   - h1g1 is premature as we haven't castled yet

Best options seem to be between f1c4 (developing bishop to active square) and d2d4 (gaining central space). 

d2d4 is the most principled move:
- Gains central space
- Opens lines for both bishops
- Challenges Black's e5 pawn
- Maintains all options for development

Therefore, I'll play:

```
d2d4
```
