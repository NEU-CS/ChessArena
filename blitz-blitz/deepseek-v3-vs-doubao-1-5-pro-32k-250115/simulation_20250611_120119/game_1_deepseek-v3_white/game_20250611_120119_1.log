2025-06-11 12:01:34,433 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 12:01:49,067 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.63s):
Given the initial position, White has several reasonable moves to consider. The most common and principled moves are 1.e4 or 1.d4, which control the center and open lines for the bishops and queen. Other moves like 1.Nf3 or 1.c4 are also solid but less direct in occupying the center.

Let's analyze the top candidates:

1. **e2e4**: This is the classic King's Pawn opening. It opens lines for the queen and bishop, controls the d5 square, and allows for quick development. It leads to open games and is very flexible for various openings like the Italian, Ruy Lopez, or Sicilian if Black responds with e5 or c5.

2. **d2d4**: This is the Queen's Pawn opening. It controls the e5 square and opens lines for the queen and bishop. It leads to more closed positions and is the starting move for openings like the Queen's Gambit, Indian defenses, etc.

3. **g1f3**: This is the Reti Opening. It develops the knight to a good square, controls the center indirectly, and keeps options open for transpositions into other openings. It's more flexible but less direct than e4 or d4.

4. **c2c4**: This is the English Opening. It controls the d5 square and prepares for a flank-based strategy. It's flexible but less direct than e4 or d4.

Given the urgency and the need to play with utmost caution while pressing for an advantage, **1.e4** is the most aggressive and principled move. It immediately stakes a claim in the center and opens lines for rapid development. It also leads to positions where White can play for a win with clear plans.
