2025-07-10 18:29:11,117 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 35.87s):
Let's analyze the current position:

- It's the starting position of a standard chess game.
- Both sides have their pieces in their initial positions.
- The goal is to develop pieces quickly, control the center, and prepare for castling.

**Candidate Moves:**

1. **g1f3**: Develops the knight to a natural square, attacking the f7 pawn (which is weak) and preparing for kingside castling.
2. **b1c3**: Also develops the knight, but less commonly used in the opening compared to Nf3.
3. **e2e4**: Controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop, and prepares for development.
4. **d2d4**: Similar to e4, but attacks the center from another diagonal.
5. **Other pawn moves**: These are generally not recommended in the opening as they weaken the pawn structure without clear compensation.

**Analysis:**
- Developing knights first (Nf3 or Nc3) is a common opening principle.
- Controlling the center with pawns (e4 or d4) is also important.
- In this case, moving the knight to f3 is more flexible and allows for better piece coordination later.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to develop the knight to f3.

2025-07-10 18:30:24,259 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 15.59s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1. Nf3 b5**

- Black has played...b5, which is an unusual opening move. It challenges White's center and prepares to develop pieces quickly.
- White's knight on f3 is well-placed, controlling key squares.
- The pawn structure is still intact, but Black's king-side pawns are advanced slightly.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxe5**: Captures the pawn, but after...Bxe5, White loses the initiative.
2. **Nxd4**: Gains material, but after...exd4, White's knight is exposed.
3. **Nc3**: Develops the knight, supports d4, and keeps options open.
4. **d4**: Attacks the isolated b-pawn, but may overextend.
5. **e4**: Centralizes the pawn, but may be premature against...b4.

**Best move analysis:**
- **Nc3** is solid, develops a piece, supports d4, and keeps flexibility. It also prevents...b4.
- **d4** is tempting, but after...b4, White's center becomes weak.
- **Nxe5+** is too risky, leading to loss of tempo.
- **Nxd4** gives up a pawn without compensation.

**Conclusion:**  
The most principled and flexible move is **Nc3**, developing a piece, supporting central control, and preparing for further development.

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** rnbqkb1r/p1pppppp/5n2/1p6/8/2N2N2/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3  
**White to move**

### Position Analysis:
- **Material**: Equal so far.
- **Development**: Both sides have developed knights, but Black has played...b5, which is unusual early on and slightly weakens the queenside pawn structure.
- **King Safety**: Neither king is castled yet.
- **Tactical Opportunities**:
    - The knight on c3 is well-placed, eyeing d5 and e4.
    - The bishop on f1 is undeveloped; better to develop it before moving other pieces.
    - The knight on f3 could jump to e5, attacking the center and possibly supporting future kingside castling.
    - There is no immediate tactical threat from either side.

### Candidate Moves:
1. **Nxe5+**: This would capture the knight on e5, but after...dxe5, White loses control of the center and doesn't gain much.
2. **Ncxd5**: Capturing the pawn on d5 opens lines for the queen and rooks, but leaves the knight exposed.
3. **Nxe5+**: As mentioned earlier, not ideal.
4. **Nc3-e4**: Develops the knight further into the center, supports e5 push later, and keeps options open.
5. **Nc3-b5**: Attacks the queen on c8, but after Qxb5, White loses material.
6. **Nc3-d5**: Centralizes the knight, attacks e6, and prepares for potential kingside castling.
7. **Developing the bishop**: Bf1-g2 or Bf1-c4, but these don't immediately improve the position.

### Best Move:
The most principled and flexible move is **Nc3-d5**, centralizing the knight, attacking e6, and preparing for potential kingside development. It also puts pressure on Black’s position without exposing White’s own pieces unnecessarily.

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** rnbqkb1r/p1ppppp1/5n1p/1p1N4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4  
**White to move**

**Material:** Equal  
**Positional factors:**
- Black has played...b5, which is unusual and slightly weakening.
- The knight on d5 is very strong, attacking both f6 and e7.
- Black's king is still in the center, and their development is lagging.
- White has castled kingside already (though not yet completed).
- Black's bishop on c8 hasn't developed yet.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nd5-e7+**: This is a forced move, checking the black king. After...Kxe7, White can follow up with Qd2+, winning the exchange.
2. **Nd5-c7**: Attacks the queen, but after...Qxc7, White doesn't gain much.
3. **Nd5-f6**: Captures the knight, but Black can recapture with the pawn, and White loses time.
4. **Ng5**: Develops the knight, but doesn't address the immediate threat.
5. **Other moves**: Most other moves don't capitalize on the strong knight on d5.

**Calculation:**
- **Nd5-e7+ Kxe7 Qd2+ Kb8 (or Ka8) Qxb5+ wins the exchange.**
- Other lines either lose material or don't create threats.

**Conclusion:**  
The most forcing and advantageous move is **Nd5-e7+**, leading to a clear material advantage.

My move:
```
d5e7

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** rnbqkb1r/p1ppNpp1/7p/1p6/4n3/5N2/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5  
**White to move**

### Position Analysis:
- **Material**: Equal so far.
- **Piece Activity**:
    - Black has played...Be4, attacking our knight on e7.
    - Our knight on e7 is under attack and needs to find safety or reposition.
    - The black bishop on e4 is very active and controls key squares.
    - We have a strong central presence with pawns on d4 and e4 (though not yet fully developed).
    - Our king is still in its starting position; we should avoid unnecessary risks early.

### Candidate Moves:
From the list of legal moves, let’s focus on those that improve our position or deal with threats:

#### Knight on e7:
- `e7g8`: Retreats the knight to g8 — passive.
- `e7c8`: Retreats to c8 — also passive.
- `e7g6`: Attacks the pawn on f7, but doesn't resolve the immediate threat from Be4.
- `e7c6`: Retreats to c6 — safer than g8/c8, but still passive.
- `e7f5`: Retreats to f5 — blocks the diagonal of Be4, but weakens f5.
- `e7d5`: Retreats to d5 — defends against Be4, but loses control of e4 square.

#### Other Knights:
- `f3g5`: Develops the knight to g5 — attacks h7 and puts pressure on the kingside.
- `f3e5`: Develops to e5 — supports d4 and exerts pressure on f7.
- `f3h4`: Less useful here.
- `f3d4`: Develops to d4 — good development, but allows Bxd4.

#### Queen Side Development:
- `h1g1`: Castles queenside? No, castling queen side isn’t possible yet.
- `a1b1`: Not relevant now.

#### Pawn Moves:
Most pawn moves don't address the main issue immediately.

---

### Best Move Evaluation:

The most critical issue is dealing with the bishop on e4 attacking our knight on e7. We need to either:
1. Retake the bishop (if safe),
2. Reposition the knight,
3. Or develop another piece to relieve the pressure.

Among these options, developing the knight to **g5** (`f3g5`) seems strongest because:
- It develops a piece actively.
- It attacks h7, which could become important later.
- It doesn’t allow Black to gain tempo by capturing our knight.
- It keeps flexibility for future plans.

Other options like retreating the knight lead to passivity, while developing elsewhere doesn’t address the immediate tactical problem.

---

2025-07-10 18:35:07,699 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 45.79s):
Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** rnbqkb1r/p1p1Npp1/3p3p/1p4N1/4n3/8/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6

**White to move.**

### Positional Assessment:
- **Material:** Equal so far.
- **Development:** Both sides have developed pieces roughly equally.
- **King Safety:** Neither king is under immediate threat.
- **Center Control:** Black has pushed...b5 and...d6, slightly restricting white’s center control.
- **Piece Activity:** White’s knight on e7 is very active, attacking the black queen and bishop. The knight on g5 also exerts pressure along the diagonal.

### Candidate Moves:
From the list of legal moves, we focus on those that improve piece activity, attack weaknesses, or create threats.

#### Key Candidates:
1. **e7g8**: Knight takes queen — this would be a major material gain, but after Nxe7+ Qxe7, White loses the exchange and possibly more.
2. **g5h7**: Knight forks king and rook — strong tactical idea, but after hxg5, White recaptures without significant gain.
3. **g5f7**: Knight attacks the rook on f8 — interesting, but not immediately decisive.
4. **g5e6**: Knight retreats to a safer square — less aggressive.
5. **g5e4**: Knight attacks the pawn on e4 — weakens black’s structure slightly.
6. **g5h3**: Knight attacks the rook on h8 — could lead to complications.
7. **Other pawn moves**: Not particularly threatening unless they open lines or support central pawns.

### Tactical Consideration:
The most forcing and potentially winning move appears to be **e7g8**, capturing the queen. Let's verify:

- After `Nxg8`, Black must respond with something like `Qxg8` or `Kxg8`.
    - If `Qxg8`, then White can follow up with `Ng5`, attacking the rook on f8 and gaining a strong initiative.
    - If `Kxg8`, then White can continue developing aggressively.

This seems like the most promising line, offering concrete chances for a quick advantage.

### Conclusion:
The best move is to capture the queen with the knight.

2025-07-10 18:36:53,057 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 32.14s):
Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** rnbqk1Nr/p1p1bpp1/3p3p/1p4N1/4n3/8/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7

**White to move.**

### Key Observations:
- **Material**: Roughly equal. Black has a knight on e4, which is currently pinned to the king via the bishop on e7. However, this pin is not very strong because the knight doesn't threaten anything critical right now.
- **King Safety**: Both kings are relatively safe for now. Black’s king is still in the center, while White’s king is castled.
- **Piece Activity**: White’s pieces are somewhat undeveloped compared to Black’s. The knight on g8 is hanging around without a clear purpose, and the rook on a1 hasn’t been connected yet.
- **Pawn Structure**: Black has some doubled pawns on the queenside (a7-a6-b7-b6), but they aren’t immediately dangerous. White’s pawn structure is solid.
- **Threats**: No immediate threats from either side. Black might try to develop more aggressively next, especially since their knight is active on e4.

### Candidate Moves:
From the list of legal moves, we need to choose the most promising continuation. Let’s look at some key options:

#### 1. `g8e7` – Capturing the pinned knight
This would remove the pin and potentially weaken Black’s control over the center. After `...Ne4`, White could recapture with the queen or another piece later.

#### 2. `g8f6` – Developing the knight to a more central square
This develops the knight actively and supports potential attacks on the kingside.

#### 3. `g5h7` / `g5f7` – Moving the knight away from the back rank
These moves seem less useful unless there's a specific tactical idea behind them.

#### 4. `h1g1` – Connecting the rooks
Connecting the rooks improves coordination and prepares for future attacks along the open file.

#### 5. `a1b1` – Also connects the rooks, though slightly slower than `h1g1`.

Given that both kings are safe and no immediate tactics exist, developing pieces seems like the priority. Among these, moving the knight from g8 to e7 (`g8e7`) appears most logical because it removes the pin and gains space in the center. It also opens up lines for other pieces.

However, let’s double-check if there are any hidden dangers after `g8e7`. For instance, does it expose the king? Not really — the king remains well protected.

---

### Final Decision:
The best move is to capture the pinned knight and gain central influence.

2025-07-10 18:37:55,478 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 22.85s):
Let's analyze the current position:

**Material count:**
- White: Knight on e7, Bishop on c1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Rook on a8 and h8, Bishop on c8, Knights on e4 and f6, Pawns on a7, b7, c7, d6, e5, f7, g7, h6.

**White to move.**

**Key observations:**
- White has a knight on e7 that is currently pinned against the king on e8 by the black bishop on c8. This pin prevents the knight from moving unless the bishop is attacked or moved.
- The white knight on e7 is very active and could potentially deliver mate if properly supported.
- Black's king is still in the center, which is dangerous.
- There are several pawn weaknesses on both sides, especially around the kingside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7g8**: Captures the rook on h8, but after...Kxg8, White loses material and doesn't gain a decisive advantage.
2. **e7c8**: Captures the bishop on c8, breaking the pin. After this, the knight on e7 is no longer pinned and becomes extremely powerful. It can jump to various squares, including attacking the black king directly.
3. **e7g6**: Moves the knight away from the pin, but doesn't create immediate threats.
4. **e7c6**: Similar to e7g6, just another square for the knight.
5. **e7f5**: Also moves the knight away from the pin, but again, not creating immediate threats.
6. **g5h7**: Attacks the rook on h8, but after...Rh7, White doesn't gain anything significant.
7. **g5f7**: Attacks the pawn on f7, but Black can defend easily.
8. **g5e6**: Attacks the pawn on e6, but Black can defend.
9. **g5e4**: Attacks the knight on e4, but Black can capture the knight with the queen or bishop.
10. **g5h3**: Not useful.
11. **g5f3**: Not useful.
12. **Other pawn moves**: Don't seem to improve the position significantly.

**Best move analysis:**
- **e7c8** seems like the most forcing and advantageous move. By capturing the bishop, White breaks the pin and gains a strong initiative. The knight on c8 is now completely free and can attack the black king directly. For example, after Nxc8, if Black plays Ke7, White can follow up with Qd5+ or Bxd6, gaining more material and control over the board.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e7c8
```

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** r1Nqk2r/p1p2pp1/2np3p/6N1/1p2n3/8/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9  
**White to move**

### Material count:
- **White**: Rooks (a1, h1), Bishop (c1), Queen (d1), Knights (c8, g5), Pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2)
- **Black**: Rooks (a8, h8), Knight (c6), Bishop (f8), Queen (d6), King (e8), Pawns (a7, b4, c5, d5, e5, f7)

### Key observations:
- Black has just played...b4, threatening to push further and possibly open lines against White’s king-side.
- The knight on c8 is very active and could potentially jump into dangerous squares like e7 or b6.
- The knight on g5 is also well-placed, controlling key central squares.
- White’s king is still in the center, which is risky given Black’s active pieces.
- There are no immediate threats from Black, so we should focus on improving our position and preparing for potential attacks.

### Candidate moves:
1. **c8e7+**: This would put pressure on Black’s king and might lead to some tactical complications. However, after...Kxe7, White loses the knight.
2. **c8a7**: Retreats the knight to safety but doesn’t improve the position significantly.
3. **c8d6**: Attacks the queen on d6, forcing it to move. After Qxd6, White recaptures with Nxd6, gaining material.
4. **g5h7**: Threatens mate on h8, but Black can defend easily.
5. **g5f7**: Also threatens mate, but again, Black can block.
6. **King moves**: Moving the king to safer squares like g1 or f1 is necessary but not urgent yet.

### Best move analysis:
The most promising line seems to be **c8d6**, attacking the queen. Let’s see what happens:

- **1. Nd6 Qxd6**
    - Now, White can play **2. Bxd6**, winning back the queen and leaving Black down a piece.
    - Alternatively, if Black plays...Nxd6, White wins the exchange.

This gives White a clear material advantage and puts Black under significant pressure.

### Final decision:
```
c8d6
```

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** r2qk2r/p4pp1/2np3p/6N1/1p2n3/8/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10  
**White to move**

### Key Observations:
- **Material**: Equal material so far.
- **Piece Activity**: 
    - Black has developed knights and queen, but not fully coordinated yet.
    - White’s knight on g5 is very active, attacking the black king via h7 and threatening mate ideas.
    - The white bishop on c1 is undeveloped; however, castling rights remain intact.
- **King Safety**: Both kings are relatively safe for now.
- **Tactical Opportunities**: The knight on g5 is eyeing several squares around the black king — especially h7, which could lead to immediate threats like Qxh7# if supported properly.

Given that we're looking for the most forcing continuation here, let's look at some tactical possibilities involving our knight on g5:

#### Candidate Moves:
1. `g5h7` – Knight forks queen and rook? Let's see what happens after this move...
   - After `...Kd7`, then `Qxh7+` would be met by `Ke8`.
   - Not immediately decisive unless there's more follow-up.

2. `g5f7` – Attacks the queen directly. But after `...Qxf7`, nothing too strong follows.

3. `g5e6` – Centralizes the knight further, possibly preparing...Ng4 later.

4. `g5e4` – Also centralizing, but less direct than other options.

5. `g5h3` / `g5f3` – Less relevant right now.

From these, the most aggressive seems to be moving the knight towards h7 where it threatens both the queen and potentially sets up mating patterns depending on how Black responds.

But wait! There might be something even stronger hidden among those legal moves...

Looking again at the list provided earlier, I notice another interesting option wasn't mentioned initially: `g5h7`. This move puts pressure on both the queen and the rook behind her. If Black doesn’t respond correctly, we could get into trouble quickly.

However, considering all factors including piece coordination and potential future plans, the best choice appears to be keeping maximum flexibility while maintaining pressure against the enemy king area.

Thus, my recommendation is:

```
g5h7
```

2025-07-10 18:41:57,896 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 62.35s):
Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** r2qk2r/p4p1N/2np2pp/8/1p2n3/8/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 11  
**White to move.**

### Material count:
- **White**: Queen, Rooks, Bishop, Knight, pawns (all intact)
- **Black**: Queen, Rooks, Bishop, Knight, pawns (all intact)

Material is equal.

### Key features:
- Black has just played...Nh7+ (from the partial move history: "g5h7", which corresponds to N-h7+).
- White’s knight on h7 is pinned against the king along the h-file.
- The black queen is active on d6, eyeing the kingside.
- Black’s bishop on c6 is well-placed, controlling key squares.
- White’s king is still in the center, somewhat exposed.
- White has not yet castled, so the rooks are undeveloped.

### Candidate moves:
From the list of legal moves:
- `h7f8`: Retreats the knight from pin.
- `h7f6`: Retreats the knight to a more central square.
- `h7g5`: Retreating the knight back to its original square.
- `h1g1`, `a1b1`: Castling options.
- Pawn moves like `e2e3`, `d2d4`, etc.: Development or space-gaining.

### Tactical considerations:
The most pressing issue is the pin on the h-file. If we don’t address this immediately, Black could potentially exploit it later.

#### Option A: `h7f8` – Retreats the knight.
This removes the knight from the pin, but leaves it passive on f8. It also doesn't develop anything else.

#### Option B: `h7f6` – Retreats the knight to a more central square.
This keeps the knight active while removing the pin. It also helps in developing the knight further.

#### Option C: `h7g5` – Returns the knight to its starting square.
This is less ideal because it gives up the initiative and allows Black to continue pressuring the h-file.

#### Option D: Castling (`h1g1` or `a1b1`)
Castling would help protect the king and connect the rooks. However, before doing that, we should resolve the pin on the h-file.

### Best plan:
We need to deal with the pin first. Between `h7f8` and `h7f6`, `h7f6` seems better because it keeps the knight active and develops it towards the center.

After `h7f6`, we can consider castling next move.

Let's analyze each candidate move:

### Candidate Move: `f6g8`
- **Short-Term**: This move captures the black queen on g8. It removes a major defensive piece from Black's side and opens up potential attacking lines for our pieces.
- **Long-Term**: After capturing the queen, we gain significant material advantage which can lead us towards a decisive endgame where we can capitalize on our numerical superiority.

### Candidate Move: `f6e8`
- **Short-Term**: Similar to `f6g8`, this also targets the black queen but places our knight on e8 instead of g8. While still effective in removing the queen, placing the knight on e8 might slightly restrict its mobility compared to being on g8.
- **Long-Term**: The loss of flexibility could potentially limit future tactical opportunities around the king area.

### Other Moves (`f6h7`, `f6d7`, etc.)
- These moves either don't target high-value pieces like the queen or place our knight in less optimal positions without immediate strategic gains.

Given these considerations, the most advantageous move is clearly the one that allows us to capture the black queen immediately while maintaining maximum flexibility for our knight.

```

I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.

First, let's understand the current situation:

1. Material count:
- Black has queen + rook vs White's bishop + knight + pawns
- Black's pieces are somewhat coordinated, while White's pieces need better coordination

2. Key features:
- White's king is exposed on e1
- Black's queen is active on d7
- White's knight on g8 is very strong, controlling key squares around black's king
- Black's pawn structure is weak with doubled pawns on the queenside

Looking at the legal moves, I see several options that could improve our position:

Candidate moves analysis:

1. **g8e7**: This would capture the queen, but after Qxe7+ we'd lose material and our king would be further exposed.

2. **g8h6**: This seems risky as it exposes the knight to potential attacks from black's pieces.

3. **g8f6**: This keeps pressure on black's king area but doesn't immediately create threats.

4. **h1g1**: Developing the rook to support the kingside, but not directly addressing our immediate concerns.

The most promising option appears to be moving the knight to e7 where it can attack black's queen while also supporting our king. Although there's some risk, this move creates immediate threats and forces black into difficult decisions.

After careful consideration, I believe the best move is:

```
g8e7
```

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 2rq3r/p2kNp2/2np2pp/8/1p2n3/8/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 6 14  
**White to move**

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, Rooks, Bishop, Knight, Pawns
- Black: Queen, Rooks, Knights, Pawns

**Positional factors:**
- Black has a knight on d6 that is very active and threatening.
- The black king is exposed on d7.
- White's rook on e7 is pinned against the queen on d7.
- White's bishop on c1 is undeveloped.
- White's knight on f6 is attacking the black queen on d7.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7g8**: Captures the black queen, winning material.
2. **e7c8**: Captures the black queen, also winning material.
3. **e7g6**: Attacks the black queen but doesn't capture it immediately.
4. **e7c6**: Attacks the black queen but doesn't capture it immediately.
5. **e7f5**: Develops the rook but doesn't gain immediate material.
6. **e7d5**: Develops the rook but doesn't gain immediate material.
7. **Other pawn moves**: Not relevant here as they don't address the immediate threat.

**Analysis:**
- The most forcing and decisive move is to capture the black queen with either rook. Both e7g8 and e7c8 achieve this.
- After capturing the queen, White will have a significant material advantage and should be able to convert it into a win.

**Calculation:**
- After **e7g8**, Black loses the queen, and White can continue developing pieces and launching an attack on the black king.
- Similarly, after **e7c8**, Black loses the queen, and White can proceed similarly.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the black queen with the rook. Between the two options, both are equally good, but let's choose **e7g8** as it attacks from a more central square.

My move:
```
e7g8

2025-07-10 18:50:04,956 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 38.66s):
Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 2r3Nr/p1qk1p2/2np2pp/8/1p2n3/8/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 8 15

**Material count:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Queen (d1), King (e1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: Rook (c8), Knight (g8), Bishop (c7), Queen (d7), King (d8), pawns (a7, b7, c5, d5, e5, f7, g7)

**Positional factors:**
- White has a strong center with pawns on d2, e2, f2, and g2.
- Black's king is exposed on d8, and their queen is on d7, which is somewhat passive.
- The knight on g8 is awkwardly placed and could be attacked.
- White's rook on a1 is undeveloped, but the bishop on c1 is ready to develop.
- There are no immediate threats from Black, so White should look for ways to improve piece activity and create pressure.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8e7**: Captures the knight, opens up lines for the white pieces, and attacks the black queen indirectly.
2. **g8h6**: Attacks the black queen directly, but after...Qxh6, White loses material.
3. **g8f6**: Not useful; doesn't threaten anything significant.
4. **Developing moves**: These don't address the opportunity to capture the knight.

**Analysis:**
- After **g8e7**, Black cannot recapture with the queen because that would lose the queen to the bishop on c1. For example:
    - 1. g8e7 Qxe7+ 2. Be7 (threatening mate on h8) and White wins the exchange.
    - Alternatively, if Black tries to defend with...Nxd7, White can take with the bishop, winning the exchange.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the knight on g8 with the pawn, opening up lines and creating mating threats.

My move is:
```
g8e7
```

2025-07-10 18:51:08,313 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 12.91s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.

First, let's understand the current state of the game:

- Material count: Both sides have equal material (rooks, knights, pawns)
- Black has castled kingside
- White's king is still in its starting position
- Black has a passed pawn on the queenside that could become dangerous
- White has a knight on e7 that's very active
- The bishop pair is a significant advantage for White

Looking at the legal moves, we need to focus on improving our position while preventing black from making progress. Let's examine some key candidates:

1. **e7g8**: This would capture the rook on g8, but after...Kxg8, we lose the initiative and allow black to consolidate their position.

2. **e7c8**: Capturing the rook here also leads to similar problems as above.

3. **e7g6**: This seems interesting as it attacks both the queen and the rook on f8. After...fxg6, we gain control of the center and open lines for our pieces.

4. **e7c6**: This develops the knight further into the center but doesn't immediately threaten anything important.

5. **e7f5**: This threatens to invade the seventh rank and attack black's back rank, but might be premature without proper support.

The most promising option appears to be e7g6 because:
- It creates immediate threats against black's queen and rook
- After...fxg6, we can follow up with Qxf7+ winning material
- It opens lines for our other pieces
- It prevents black from consolidating their position

Let me double-check for any tactical traps:
- After e7g6 fxg6, Qxf7+ wins the exchange (black loses two minor pieces for a rook)
- There are no immediate counterattacks from black
- Our king remains safe

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e7g6
```

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 2r4r/p1q2p2/3pk1Np/n7/1p2n3/8/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 17  
**White to move**

### Material count:
- **White**: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Queen (d1), King (e1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2)
- **Black**: Rooks (a8, h8), Queen (c7), Knight (a5), Knight (e6), King (e7), pawns (a7, b7, c7, d7)

### Key observations:
- Black has a strong initiative due to their active pieces and central control.
- The black queen on c7 is very dangerous, threatening to invade along the c-file or support pawn breaks.
- White’s knight on g6 is well-placed, attacking both the black king and possibly supporting future attacks.
- White’s rook on a1 is undeveloped and not yet involved in the action.
- Black’s king is exposed on e7, which could be exploited if White can coordinate an attack.

### Candidate moves:
1. **g6h8+**: This checks the black king, forcing it to move. After Ke7-f7, White can follow up with Qd1-d7+, winning material.
2. **g6f8+**: Also checks the king, but less direct than g6h8+.
3. **g6e7**: Captures the black king, but this is illegal because kings cannot capture each other.
4. **g6e5**: Attacks the knight on a5, but doesn’t create immediate threats.
5. **Other moves**: Most involve developing minor pieces or advancing pawns, but none seem as decisive as checking the king.

### Tactical calculation:
- **g6h8+**: 
    - 17...Ke7-f7 (only legal move)
    - 18. Qd1-d7+ wins the black queen!
    - After 18...Kxd7, White gains a massive material advantage.

This sequence leads to a forced win for White.

### Final decision:
The best move is to deliver check with the knight, forcing the black king away and setting up a mating net.

2025-07-10 18:54:17,796 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 47.23s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.

First, let's understand the current state of the game:

- Material count: Black has a rook, knight, pawn, queen, king, and pawns; White has a bishop, knight, queen, king, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.
- King safety: Both kings seem relatively safe for now.
- Pawn structure: Black has some passed pawns that could become dangerous if not addressed.
- Piece activity: White's pieces appear somewhat passive compared to Black's more active ones.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to choose the most promising option. Let's examine them:

1. **h8f7**: This would capture Black's knight on f7, gaining material immediately. It also opens up lines for our other pieces.
2. **h8g6**: Capturing another piece but doesn't gain as much material as f7.
3. Other moves like castling or advancing pawns don't address immediate threats or improve our position significantly.

The move h8f7 stands out because:
- It captures a valuable knight
- It removes a defender from Black's queenside
- It opens up potential attacking lines against Black's position

After capturing the knight, we should look to capitalize on our increased material advantage. The resulting position after h8f7 would give us a significant edge that we can use to push for a decisive attack.

2025-07-10 18:56:04,030 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 53.29s):
Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 2r5/p1q2N2/2npk2p/8/1p6/8/PPPPPnPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 19

White has just played... and it's my turn as White. The partial move history shows that Black has been aggressive, pushing pawns and attacking the king side. My knight is on f7, which is quite active, and I need to find a way to capitalize on this.

### Key Observations:
- **Black's King is exposed**: It's on e6, and there are no immediate defenders nearby.
- **My Knight on f7 is very strong**: It controls several key squares around the black king.
- **Black's queen and rook are active**, but they're not immediately threatening me.
- **I should look for tactics involving my knight**.

### Candidate Moves:
1. **f7-h8+**: This would put pressure on the black king and potentially open up lines for my other pieces.
2. **f7-d8+**: Another fork possibility, but less direct than h8+.
3. **f7-g5**: Attacks the pawn on g6, but doesn't directly threaten the king.
4. **f7-e5**: Centralizes the knight, but doesn't create immediate threats.
5. **Other moves like castling or advancing pawns** seem passive compared to using the knight aggressively.

### Tactical Check:
If I play **f7-h8+**, what happens?
- Black must respond to the threat of mate or loss of material.
- Possible responses include moving the king (but where?), blocking with a piece, or sacrificing something.

Let’s assume Black plays **...Kf5** (moving away from the back rank).
Then I could follow up with **Qxf5**, winning the queen.

Alternatively, if Black tries to block with a pawn, say **...g5**, then I can take the pawn with **Nh6**, maintaining pressure.

Given the options, **f7-h8+** seems the most forcing and dangerous move, creating immediate threats against the black king.

### Final Move:
```

2025-07-10 18:57:01,356 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 10.22s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.

Current assessment:
- Material count: Black has a rook vs White's knight, but Black also has a queen that's currently trapped behind their own pawns
- King safety: Both kings are relatively safe, though Black's king is more exposed due to the open f-file
- Tactical opportunities: The trapped queen presents immediate tactical possibilities

Let me examine my options:

1. **h8f7**: This would capture Black's queen immediately. After Qxf7+, I'd need to respond appropriately. However, after...Kxf7, I'd lose material since my knight would be captured next.

2. **h8g6**: This seems risky as it exposes my knight without clear compensation.

3. **h1g1**: Moving the rook doesn't seem useful here.

4. **e1f2**: Developing the bishop isn't particularly urgent given the tactical situation.

Looking at these options, the most promising appears to be capturing the queen with **h8f7**, despite the follow-up complications. Let's see what happens:

After h8f7+ Kxf7, I should recapture with my knight: Nxc6. Now Black's queen is gone and I've gained material.

Other moves either don't address the immediate tactical opportunity or lead to worse positions.

```

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 4r3/p1q2N2/2npk2p/8/1p4n1/8/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 5 21  
White to move.

### Material count:
- **White**: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Queen (d1), King (e1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2)
- **Black**: Rook (e8), Knight (c6), Knight (f7), Queen (d6), King (g4), pawns (a7, b7, c7, f7)

### Key observations:
- Black has a strong knight on f7 that is currently attacking our king (e1).
- The black queen is on d6, eyeing potential threats.
- Our rook on a1 is undeveloped; we should connect it soon.
- We need to address the immediate threat from Nf7+.

### Immediate concerns:
- The knight on f7 is giving checks along the diagonal (from f7 to e8, g8, etc.) — so we must either capture it or block its attack path.
- The only way to stop Nf7+ is to capture it or move the king out of line.

### Candidate moves:
1. **f7h8**: Capture the knight with the bishop. This removes the immediate threat and gains material.
2. **f7d8**: Move the knight away from the attack, but this doesn't solve the problem immediately.
3. **Other king moves**: Moving the king would allow the knight to continue checking us unless we also defend against other threats.

### Evaluation:
- Capturing the knight with Bxf7 is clearly better than allowing it to stay and potentially create more problems later.
- After Bxf7+, we gain a piece and reduce Black’s pressure significantly.

### Conclusion:
The best move is to capture the knight with the bishop.

My move is:
```
f7h8

2025-07-10 18:59:16,119 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 24.03s):
Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 2q1r2N/p7/2npk2p/8/1p4n1/8/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 7 22

**White to move.**

### Material count:
- **White**: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Queen (d1), King (e1), Knight (h8), pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2.
- **Black**: Rook (f8), Queen (g4), Bishop (e8), Knight (c6), Knight (g4), King (d7), pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, g7.

**Material-wise**, Black has two knights and a queen vs. White’s rook, bishop, queen, king, knight, and pawns. So material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.

### Positional factors:
- **White’s knight on h8** is very strong, attacking both g6 and f7 squares.
- **Black’s queen on g4** is well-placed, eyeing the kingside and threatening checks along the g-file and diagonal.
- **Black’s king is exposed** on d7, vulnerable to checks from White’s knight or other pieces.
- **White’s king is safe** behind its pawn wall.
- **White has a passed pawn on f2**, which could become dangerous if advanced.

### Candidate moves:
1. **h8f7+**: Knight takes on f7, forcing the black king to move. This would open up lines for White’s pieces and potentially lead to a mating attack.
2. **h8g6**: Knight retreats to g6, defending against potential threats but not making progress.
3. **Other pawn moves**: These don’t seem urgent unless there's a specific plan.
4. **King castling**: Not necessary yet; White’s king is fine where it is.
5. **Queen or bishop development**: Not needed immediately.

### Tactical considerations:
- After **h8f7+**, Black must respond. Let's see what happens:
    - If **...Kxf7**, then White can follow up with **Qxg4**, winning the queen.
    - If **...Ke7**, then White can try **Ng6+**, forcing the king back, and continue with pressure.

But let's check if there are any immediate tactical shots after **h8f7+**.

After **h8f7+**, suppose Black plays **...Kxf7**:
- Then **Qxg4** wins the queen, leaving Black with only a rook and minor pieces vs. White’s full complement.

Alternatively, if Black tries to defend differently, like moving the king away, White can still maintain control.

Therefore, **h8f7+** seems like the most forcing and advantageous move, leading to a significant material gain.

### Final decision:
```
h8f7

2025-07-10 19:00:09,248 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 11.50s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.

First, let's understand the current situation:

- Material count: Black has a queen vs White's knight + bishop + rook + pawns. We're down significant material.
- King safety: Both kings are exposed, but Black's king is more vulnerable due to being in the center.
- Tactical opportunities: There might be chances to create threats against Black's king or disrupt their coordination.

Looking at the legal moves, I need to focus on positions that either threaten Black's king or improve my own piece activity while minimizing risks.

The most promising options seem to be those involving the knight on f7, which is currently very active. The move f7h6 looks interesting because:
1. It attacks Black's pawn on g7
2. It threatens to jump back to g8 where it could potentially support an attack on the black king
3. It keeps pressure on Black's position

Other moves like f7d8 don't seem as effective since they don't directly target Black's weaknesses. Moves involving other pieces (like castling) would be too slow given our material disadvantage.

After careful consideration, the move f7h6 seems to offer the best immediate prospects by creating direct threats against Black's position.

2025-07-10 19:01:38,417 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 27.65s):
Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 2q5/p7/2npr2N/3k4/1p4n1/8/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 24

**White to move.**

### Material:
- **White**: Rooks, Bishop, Queen, pawns; knight on h6.
- **Black**: Queen, rook, bishop, knights, pawns; king on d5.

### Positional Factors:
- Black has a strong center with pawns on d5 and e6, supported by the queen and rook.
- The black knight on f7 is very active, attacking the white pawn on g4.
- The white knight on h6 is also well-placed, eyeing the g4 square.
- The white king is safe in the corner, while the black king is exposed on d5.
- There are no immediate threats from Black, but White needs to avoid losing material and look for ways to improve their position.

### Candidate Moves:
1. **h6g8+**: Knight checks the black king, forcing it to move. This could open up lines for the white pieces.
2. **h6f7**: Captures the black knight, gaining a piece.
3. **h6f5**: Retreats the knight, possibly preparing to re-enter the attack.
4. **h6g4**: Captures the pawn, but after...hxg4, Black recaptures with the knight, and White loses a pawn.
5. **King-side castling**: Not immediately useful here.
6. **Pawn moves**: Generally passive unless creating space or supporting an attack.

### Tactical Considerations:
- **h6g8+** forces the black king to move (likely to c6 or e6). After that, White can bring the queen into play or double the rooks on the kingside.
- **h6f7** wins a knight, which is significant material gain.
- However, after h6f7, Black can respond with Qxf7, winning back the knight and leaving White down a piece.

### Best Move:
The most forcing and advantageous move is **h6g8**, checking the black king and opening up possibilities for White to launch an attack. It also prevents Black from consolidating their position.

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 2q3N1/p7/2npr3/8/1pk3n1/8/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 25

White has just moved, and the last few moves were:
-... Qxf7+ Kh8
-... Nxd5 exd5
-... Qxh6
-... Nxc4

Now, Black's queen is on h6, threatening mate on g8. The knight on g8 is pinned to the king by the queen on h6. However, there is no immediate threat from Black unless we allow them to deliver mate.

Our goal should be to either:
1. Escape the pin and avoid mate.
2. Create counterplay against Black's weakened kingside.

Looking at the legal moves:

### Candidate Moves:
- **g8e7**: Knight moves to e7, escaping the pin. This seems safe.
- **g8h6**: Knight captures the queen, but after Qxh6, we lose material.
- **g8f6**: Knight moves to f6, also escaping the pin.
- Other pawn moves don't seem relevant right now.

The most critical thing here is that we must not allow Black to deliver mate. Both `g8e7` and `g8f6` escape the pin safely.

Between these two, moving to e7 keeps more flexibility because:
- It doesn't block our own pieces as much.
- It maintains control over key squares around the black king.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8e7
```

2025-07-10 19:03:39,613 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 29.24s):
I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.

First, let's understand the current situation:

1. Material count:
- White has a knight on e7, pawns on a2,b2,c2,d2,e2,f2,g2,h2, rook on a1, bishop on c1, queen on d1, king on e1
- Black has a pawn on a7, pawns on b7,c7,d7,f7,g7,h7, knight on c4, knight on f6, rook on a6, bishop on a6, king on c8

2. Key observations:
- White's knight on e7 is very active and well-placed
- Black's pieces are somewhat scattered
- The queenside seems more open than the kingside
- There's potential for tactical opportunities due to the exposed black king

Looking at the legal moves, I need to choose between several options that involve moving the knight or advancing pawns.

The most promising options seem to be:
- Moving the knight to g8 (e7g8) which would put pressure on black's position
- Advancing pawns like e2e4 or d2d4 to gain space

Let me analyze these options:

Option 1: e7g8
- This attacks black's pawn on a7 indirectly
- It also threatens to jump back to f6, attacking the black knight on c4
- However, after...Nxc4, we'd lose material

Option 2: e2e4
- Gains space in the center
- Opens lines for our pieces
- But doesn't immediately threaten anything concrete

Option 3: d2d4
- Similar to e2e4, gains central control
- Also opens up possibilities for development

After careful consideration, I believe the best move is to advance the e-pawn to e4. This:
1. Gains central control
2. Opens lines for our pieces
3. Doesn't expose our own king unnecessarily
4. Maintains flexibility in our piece placement

```
e2e4

2025-07-10 19:05:13,095 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 28.34s):
Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 8/p3N3/q1npr3/8/1p1kP1n1/8/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 27

White has just played **e4-e5**, pushing the pawn forward. Black's king is exposed on e6, and there are several pieces on both sides that could potentially become active.

### Key Observations:
- **Black's King**: On e6, somewhat exposed but not immediately under threat.
- **White's Pieces**:
    - Knight on e7 — very strong, controlling key squares around the black king.
    - Bishop on f1 — ready to swing into action.
    - Queen on d1 — can join the attack or defend.
    - Rooks on a1 and h1 — still passive but can come into play.
- **Black's Pieces**:
    - Queen on a6 — attacking the knight on e7.
    - Knights on c4 and g8 — both threatening White’s position.
    - Pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7 — mostly solid, except possibly the d-pawn which is advanced.

### Candidate Moves:
1. **e7-g8+**: This would fork the queen and rook, but after...Kxg8, White loses material unless there's a follow-up.
2. **e7-c8+**: Similar idea, but less forcing.
3. **e7-g6+**: Forces the king to move away from the center, but doesn't create immediate threats.
4. **e7-c6+**: Also forces the king to move, but again, no clear follow-up.
5. **e7-f5+**: Attacks the queen indirectly, but not decisive.
6. **e7-d5**: Centralizes the knight further, but doesn’t threaten anything immediate.
7. **f1-a6**: Captures the queen, winning a piece!
8. **Other moves**: Most seem defensive or slow compared to capturing the queen.

### Evaluation:
The most forcing and advantageous move appears to be **f1-a6**, capturing the queen. After this, White gains a significant material advantage and can continue to pressure Black’s weakened kingside.

After **f1-a6**, Black will likely respond with something like **Qxa6**, but even so, White retains a large lead in development and initiative.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f1a6
```

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 8/p3n3/B2pr3/8/1p1kP1n1/8/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 28

White has just played... and it's their turn. The key features of the position are:

- Black's king is exposed on e7.
- White has a bishop on a6, which is very active and threatening.
- Black's knight on d4 is attacking the bishop on a6.
- White's rook on a1 is not yet developed.
- White's queen is still on d1.
- Black's pawn structure is somewhat weakened around the kingside.

### Candidate Moves Analysis:

#### 1. **a6c8**
- This would capture the black knight on c8, but after...Nxc8, White loses material and doesn't gain much positional compensation.

#### 2. **a6b7**
- Similar to a6c8, this also captures a piece but leads to similar issues.

#### 3. **a6b5**
- This keeps pressure on the black king and threatens further attacks. It also avoids immediate loss of material.

#### 4. **a6c4**
- This brings the bishop closer to the center but doesn't immediately threaten anything concrete.

#### 5. **a6d3**
- Also centralizing the bishop but less direct than other options.

#### 6. **a6e2**
- This is a strong move because it checks the black king and forces it to move. After...Ke8, White can continue with aggressive plans like Qd3+ or Bxg7.

#### 7. **a6f1**
- Less effective; doesn't create immediate threats.

#### 8. **Other rook moves (h1g1, etc.)**
- These don't seem to contribute to the immediate attack on the black king.

#### 9. **Queen moves (d1g4, d1f3, etc.)**
- These are too slow compared to the bishop's potential.

#### 10. **Pawn moves (e4e5, etc.)**
- Not relevant here due to the urgency of attacking the black king.

### Best Move:
The most forcing and advantageous move is **a6e2**, delivering a discovered check via the bishop and putting maximum pressure on Black's exposed king.

```

Let's analyze the current position:

**FEN:** 8/p3n3/3p4/4r3/1p1kP1n1/8/PPPPB1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 29

**White to move.**

### Material count:
- **White**: Rooks (a1, h1), Bishop (c1), Queen (d1), Pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, g2, h2)
- **Black**: King (e5), Rook (d4), Knight (e7, g8), Pawns (a7, b7)

Material is roughly equal, but Black has two knights vs. White’s bishop + rooks. However, Black’s king is exposed and their pieces are somewhat scattered.

### Key features:
- Black’s knight on e7 is attacking the white pawn on d2.
- The black rook on d4 is eyeing the open file.
- White’s queen is centralized on d1, ready to swing into action.
- White’s bishop on c1 controls important diagonals.
- White’s king is safe behind pawns.

### Candidate moves:
1. **e2-e5+**: This would fork the black king and rook, forcing the rook to move or lose material.
2. **e2-d3**: Defends against the knight and prepares to challenge the center.
3. **e2-f3**: Attacks the knight on g8 and threatens to double rooks on the f-file.
4. **e2-c4**: Centralizes the pawn and attacks the knight on e7.
5. **e2-g4**: Not very useful; doesn't threaten anything immediate.
6. **e2-b5**: Not threatening; just moving the pawn.
7. **e2-a6**: Not useful; just moving the pawn.
8. **e2-f1**: Not useful; just moving the pawn.
9. **King moves**: Not necessary; king is safe.
10. **Pawn moves**: Most don’t do much except defend or advance.

### Tactical idea:
The most forcing move is **e2-e5+**, which forks the black king and rook. Let's see what happens after this:

**1. e2-e5+**
- If **...Ke4**, then **Qxd4** wins the rook.
- If **...Re4**, then **Qxe4** wins the rook.
- If **...Nxe5**, then **Qxe5** wins the knight.

So regardless of how Black responds, White gains a significant material advantage.

### Conclusion:
The best move is clearly **e2-e5+**, which forces Black into a losing position.

```
e2e5
```

2025-07-10 19:12:36,833 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-2_blitz) (took 73.44s):
Okay, let's re-examine the situation. I made a mistake earlier when analyzing the legality of the move `e2e5`. It turns out that this move isn't actually available in the current position, likely because the square e5 is occupied or blocked by other pieces.

Given the list of legal moves provided, I need to choose from these options:

- e2a6
- e2b5
- e2g4
- e2c4
- e2f3
- e2d3
- e2f1
- h1g1
- h1f1
- e1f1
- a1b1
- e1g1
- h2h3
- g2g3
- d2d3
- c2c3
- b2b3
- a2a3
- h2h4
- c2c4
- a2a4

Since `e2e5` is illegal, I should look for the next best move that still maintains pressure on Black while avoiding any tactical blunders.

Looking at the legal moves again, `e2c4` stands out as a strong option. It centralizes the pawn, attacks the knight on e7, and opens lines for potential future attacks. It also helps control key squares around the black king.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e2c4
```
