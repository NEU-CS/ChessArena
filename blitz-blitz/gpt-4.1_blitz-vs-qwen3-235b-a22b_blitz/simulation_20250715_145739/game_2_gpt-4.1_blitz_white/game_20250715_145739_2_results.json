This is the Open Game (Double King's Pawn Opening).\n\nLegal moves for White include:\n- Developing knights: Nf3, Nc3\n- Developing bishops: Bc4, Bb5, Bd3, Be2\n- Advancing pawns: d3, d4, f4, c3, a3, h3\n- Queen moves: Qe2, Qf3, Qg4, etc. (but early queen moves are rarely good)\n- Castling is not yet possible.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the best candidate moves:\n\n1. **Nf3**: Attacks the e5 pawn, develops a piece, and prepares for kingside castling. This is the main line and the most principled move.\n2. **Nc3**: Develops a piece, but doesn't put immediate pressure on e5.\n3. **d4**: Immediately challenges the center. After exd4, White can recapture with the queen or knight, but this can lead to early queen exposure.\n4. **Bc4**: Develops a piece, eyes f7, but doesn't contest the center as directly as Nf3 or d4.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Nf3 is the most flexible and classical move, directly attacking e5 and preparing to castle.\n- d4 is also playable, but after exd4, Qxd4, Nc6, White's queen can be harassed.\n- Nc3 is solid but less ambitious.\n- Bc4 is fine, but Nf3 is more standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is 2.Nf3.\n\nUCI notation for this move is: g1f3\n\n```\ng1f3\n```",

You are playing as Black.\nWe will provide all legal moves and you should analyze the moves and choose one from them. This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.\nWhen you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"
