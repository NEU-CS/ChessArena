2025-07-15 14:58:01,310 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.10s):
Let's analyze the starting position:

- All pieces are on their original squares.
- It is White to move.
- All standard opening moves are available.

**Candidate moves:**
1. e2e4 — King's Pawn Opening: Controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.
2. d2d4 — Queen's Pawn Opening: Also controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.
3. c2c4 — English Opening: Controls the center, more flexible, less direct.
4. g1f3 — Knight to f3: Develops a piece, controls the center, flexible.
5. Other knight moves (b1c3), flank pawn moves (g2g3, b2b3), or bishop moves (f1c4, f1b5) are less common as first moves.

**Strategic considerations:**
- e4 and d4 are the most popular and best-scoring opening moves for White.
- e4 is slightly more aggressive, leading to open games and rapid development.
- d4 can lead to more closed or semi-open positions.

**Short-term tactics:**
- No immediate threats; focus on controlling the center and developing pieces.

**Long-term strategy:**
- Aim for rapid development, central control, and king safety.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is the most popular and aggressive opening: 1. e4.

```

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2

It's White to move. Black has just played 1...e5, mirroring White's 1.e4. This is the Open Game (Double King's Pawn Opening).

Legal moves for White include:
- Developing knights: Nf3, Nc3
- Developing bishops: Bc4, Bb5, Bd3, Be2
- Advancing pawns: d3, d4, f4, c3, a3, h3
- Queen moves: Qe2, Qf3, Qg4, etc. (but early queen moves are rarely good)
- Castling is not yet possible.

Let’s consider the best candidate moves:

1. **Nf3**: Attacks the e5 pawn, develops a piece, and prepares for kingside castling. This is the main line and the most principled move.
2. **Nc3**: Develops a piece, but doesn't put immediate pressure on e5.
3. **d4**: Immediately challenges the center. After exd4, White can recapture with the queen or knight, but this can lead to early queen exposure.
4. **Bc4**: Develops a piece, eyes f7, but doesn't contest the center as directly as Nf3 or d4.

**Analysis:**
- Nf3 is the most flexible and classical move, directly attacking e5 and preparing to castle.
- d4 is also playable, but after exd4, Qxd4, Nc6, White's queen can be harassed.
- Nc3 is solid but less ambitious.
- Bc4 is fine, but Nf3 is more standard.

**Conclusion:** The best move is 2.Nf3.

UCI notation for this move is: g1f3

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3

**It's White to move.**

**Material:** Equal  
**Development:**  
- White: Nf3 developed, rest on original squares.  
- Black: No pieces developed, but d6 and e5 pawns out.

**Center:**  
- White has e4 pawn, Black has e5 and d6 pawns.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. d2d4 — Challenge the center, opening lines and threatening to exchange on e5.
2. Nc3 — Develops a piece, supports e4, but less ambitious than d4.
3. Bc4 — Develops bishop, eyes f7, but allows ...Nf6 with tempo.
4. Bb5+ — Check, but Black can easily block with c6 or Nd7.
5. Be2 — Quiet development.
6. h3 — Prevents ...Bg4, but not urgent.

**Tactical considerations:**
- d4 is the most principled move, striking at the center and challenging Black's e5 pawn.
- If Black exchanges (exd4), White can recapture with Nxd4, gaining a lead in development.
- If Black plays ...Nc6 after d4, White can still develop naturally.

**Strategic considerations:**
- White should aim for rapid development and central control.
- d4 is the most aggressive and classical approach.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play d2d4, challenging the center and opening lines for development.
