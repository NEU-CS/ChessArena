Controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.\n2. d2d4 \u2014 Queen's Pawn Opening. Also controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.\n3. c2c4 \u2014 English Opening.

The opening is the Open Game (Double King's Pawn Opening), and Black has just played 1...e5. The position is standard after 1.e4 e5.\n\nLegal moves for White include:\n- Developing knights: Nf3, Nc3\n- Developing bishops: Bc4, Bb5, Bd3, Be2\n- d2-d4 (immediate central break)\n- Other pawn moves: a2-a3, h2-h3, etc.\n\nLet's consider the main options:\n\n1. **Nf3**: Attacks the e5 pawn, develops a piece, and is the main line. This is the most principled move.\n2. **Nc3**: Also develops a piece, but does not attack e5 directly.\n3. **d4**: The Center Game, immediately challenging the center. After exd4, Qxd4, Black gets tempo with Nc6.\n4. **Bc4**: The Bishop's Opening, develops a piece and eyes f7.\n5. **Bb5**: The Spanish Opening (Ruy Lopez), but usually played after Nf3 and Nc6.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Nf3 is the most flexible and classical move, attacking e5 and preparing for rapid development.\n- d4 is more aggressive but can lead to early queen development, which can be targeted.\n- Nc3 is less challenging.\n- Bc4 is playable but less flexible than Nf3.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is 2.Nf3, attacking e5 and developing a piece.\n\nMy move:\n```\ng1f3\n```",

Nc3 \u2013 Developing another piece, supporting the center.\n3. Bc4 \u2013 Developing the bishop to an active square, eyeing f7.\n4. Bb5+ \u2013 Checking, but Black can easily block with ...Bd7 or ...Nc6.\n5. Be2 \u2013 Preparing to castle, but less active than Bc4.\n6. h3 \u2013 Preventing ...Bg4, but not urgent.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **d2d4** is the most principled move. It directly challenges Black's center and opens lines for development. If Black exchanges (exd4), White can recapture with the knight, gaining a strong central presence. If Black ignores, White can take on e5.\n- **Nc3** is solid, but less ambitious than d4.\n- **Bc4** develops a piece, but doesn't contest the center as directly.\n- **Bb5+** is not very effective here, as Black can easily block.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to play d4, striking in the center and opening lines for development.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd2d4\n```",

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"
