2025-07-15 14:58:01,196 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.02s):
Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of a chess game. All pieces are on their original squares, and it is White to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. e2e4 — King's Pawn Opening. Controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.
2. d2d4 — Queen's Pawn Opening. Also controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.
3. c2c4 — English Opening. Controls the center, slightly less direct than e4 or d4.
4. g1f3 — Knight to f3, develops a piece and controls the center.
5. b1c3 — Knight to c3, develops a piece and controls the center.

**Analysis:**
- e4 and d4 are the most popular and best-scoring opening moves for White.
- e4 is slightly more aggressive and leads to open games, while d4 can lead to more closed positions.
- Both are excellent, but e4 is the most ambitious and classical, and gives White the best chance to press for an advantage.

**Final move:**
```
e2e4
```

2025-07-15 14:58:51,075 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.49s):
Let's analyze the position:

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2

It's White to move. The opening is the Open Game (Double King's Pawn Opening), and Black has just played 1...e5. The position is standard after 1.e4 e5.

Legal moves for White include:
- Developing knights: Nf3, Nc3
- Developing bishops: Bc4, Bb5, Bd3, Be2
- d2-d4 (immediate central break)
- Other pawn moves: a2-a3, h2-h3, etc.

Let's consider the main options:

1. **Nf3**: Attacks the e5 pawn, develops a piece, and is the main line. This is the most principled move.
2. **Nc3**: Also develops a piece, but does not attack e5 directly.
3. **d4**: The Center Game, immediately challenging the center. After exd4, Qxd4, Black gets tempo with Nc6.
4. **Bc4**: The Bishop's Opening, develops a piece and eyes f7.
5. **Bb5**: The Spanish Opening (Ruy Lopez), but usually played after Nf3 and Nc6.

**Analysis:**
- Nf3 is the most flexible and classical move, attacking e5 and preparing for rapid development.
- d4 is more aggressive but can lead to early queen development, which can be targeted.
- Nc3 is less challenging.
- Bc4 is playable but less flexible than Nf3.

**Conclusion:** The best move is 2.Nf3, attacking e5 and developing a piece.

2025-07-15 14:59:45,357 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 8.20s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3

**It's White to move.**

**Position breakdown:**
- Black has played ...d6 and ...e5. The center is contested.
- White has a knight on f3, and all other pieces are on their original squares.
- No immediate threats from Black, but Black has a solid pawn center.
- White can consider developing pieces, contesting the center, or preparing to castle.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d2d4 – Striking in the center, challenging Black's e5 pawn.
2. Nc3 – Developing another piece, supporting the center.
3. Bc4 – Developing the bishop to an active square, eyeing f7.
4. Bb5+ – Checking, but Black can easily block with ...Bd7 or ...Nc6.
5. Be2 – Preparing to castle, but less active than Bc4.
6. h3 – Preventing ...Bg4, but not urgent.

**Analysis:**

- **d2d4** is the most principled move. It directly challenges Black's center and opens lines for development. If Black exchanges (exd4), White can recapture with the knight, gaining a strong central presence. If Black ignores, White can take on e5.
- **Nc3** is solid, but less ambitious than d4.
- **Bc4** develops a piece, but doesn't contest the center as directly.
- **Bb5+** is not very effective here, as Black can easily block.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play d4, striking in the center and opening lines for development.
