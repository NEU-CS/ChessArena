You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
We will provide all legal moves and you should analyze the moves and choose one from them. This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-07-15 14:58:22,189 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 6.88s):
Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position after 1.e4. White has played the King's Pawn Opening, which is the most popular opening move in chess. As Black, I have several main responses to consider:

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...c5 (Sicilian Defense)
2. ...e5 (Open Game, symmetrical)
3. ...e6 (French Defense)
4. ...c6 (Caro-Kann Defense)
5. ...d6 (Pirc Defense)
6. ...g6 (Robatsch/Modern Defense)
7. ...d5 (Scandinavian Defense)
8. ...Nf6 (Alekhine's Defense)

**Analysis:**
- ...c5 (Sicilian Defense): This is the most combative response, aiming for an unbalanced position and fighting for the center from the flank. It leads to rich, complex positions and offers Black good winning chances.
- ...e5: Symmetrical, classical, and solid. Leads to open games, but White can steer into many well-analyzed lines.
- ...e6: French Defense, solid but can be passive if not handled well.
- ...c6: Caro-Kann, solid and less theoretical than the French.
- ...d5: Scandinavian, directly challenging the center but can lead to early queen development.
- ...Nf6: Alekhine's Defense, provocative, inviting White to advance.

Given the need to play for a win and press for advantage, the Sicilian Defense is statistically the most successful response for Black at all levels, offering dynamic counterplay and many opportunities for both sides to go wrong.

**Final decision:**  
I will play the Sicilian Defense.
