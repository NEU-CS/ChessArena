The opening is the Open Game (Double King's Pawn Opening), and Black has just played 1...e5.\n\nLegal moves for White include:\n- Developing knights: Nf3, Nc3\n- Developing bishops: Bc4, Bb5, Bd3, Be2\n- Pawn moves: d4, c3, f4, etc.\n\nLet's consider the main candidate moves:\n1. Nf3: Attacks the e5 pawn, develops a piece, and is the main line.\n2. Nc3: Develops a piece, but doesn't attack e5 directly.\n3. d4: Immediately challenges the center, but after exd4, White can recapture with the queen or knight later.\n4. Bc4: Develops a bishop, eyes f7, but doesn't contest the center as directly as Nf3 or d4.\n\nBest practice in the opening is to develop pieces, control the center, and prepare to castle.\n\n**Nf3** is the most principled move, attacking the e5 pawn and preparing to develop other pieces smoothly. It is the main line of the Open Game and keeps all options open.\n\n**d4** is also playable, but after exd4, Qxd4 or Nf3 is possible, but it gives Black a tempo with Nc6.\n\n**Bc4** is playable, but less effective than Nf3.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nNg1f3\n```",

Nc3 (developing a piece)\n3. Bc4 (developing a piece, eyeing f7)\n4. Bb5+ (check, pinning Nc6 if Black plays it)\n5. Be2 (quiet development)\n6. h3 (preventing ...Bg4)\n7. g3 (preparing Bg2)\n8. b3 (preparing Bb2)\n9. d3 (solid, but less ambitious)\n10. Nf3-g1 (retreat, not logical)\n11. Nf3-h4 (not useful)\n12. Nf3-e5 (captures pawn, but Black can reply dxe5)\n\n**Critical candidate moves:**\n- d4: The most principled, challenging the center immediately.\n- Nc3: Developing, but allows ...Nf6 and ...Be7 without contesting the center.\n- Bc4: Developing, but Black can play ...Nf6 and ...Be7, and White hasn't challenged the center yet.\n- Bb5+: Not very effective since Black can block with ...Bd7 or ...Nc6.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- If 3.d4, Black can reply exd4, Nxd4, and White has a strong center.\n- If 3.d4, Black can also play ...Nc6, but after dxe5 dxe5, White is fine.\n- If 3.Nc3, Black can play ...Nf6, and White hasn't challenged the center.\n\n**Let's calculate 3.d4:**\n1. e4 e5\n2. Nf3 d6\n3. d4\n\n- If 3...exd4 4.Nxd4, White has a lead in development and central control.\n- If 3...Nc6 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, White has traded queens and Black cannot castle, giving White a small but persistent advantage.\n- If 3...Bg4, 4.dxe5 Bxf3 5.Qxf3 dxe5 6.Bc4 Nf6, White is fine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n3.d4 is the most principled, challenging the center and opening lines for development.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nd2d4\n```",

You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.\nWhen you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"
