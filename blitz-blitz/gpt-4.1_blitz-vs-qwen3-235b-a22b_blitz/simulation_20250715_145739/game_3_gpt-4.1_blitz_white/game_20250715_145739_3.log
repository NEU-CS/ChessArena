Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of a chess game. All pieces are on their original squares, and it is White's move.

Candidate moves:
1. e2e4 – King's Pawn Opening, controls the center, opens lines for queen and bishop.
2. d2d4 – Queen's Pawn Opening, also controls the center, opens lines for queen and bishop.
3. c2c4 – English Opening, controls the center, more flexible.
4. g1f3 – Knight to f3, develops a piece, controls the center.
5. b1c3 – Knight to c3, develops a piece, controls the center.

Of these, e2e4 is the most popular and aggressive, immediately contesting the center and opening lines for both the queen and bishop. It leads to a wide variety of well-studied openings and is generally considered the best move for White in the opening.

Therefore, my move is:
```
e2e4
```

2025-07-15 14:58:49,514 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 7.13s):
Let's analyze the position:

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2

It's White to move. The opening is the Open Game (Double King's Pawn Opening), and Black has just played 1...e5.

Legal moves for White include:
- Developing knights: Nf3, Nc3
- Developing bishops: Bc4, Bb5, Bd3, Be2
- Pawn moves: d4, c3, f4, etc.

Let's consider the main candidate moves:
1. Nf3: Attacks the e5 pawn, develops a piece, and is the main line.
2. Nc3: Develops a piece, but doesn't attack e5 directly.
3. d4: Immediately challenges the center, but after exd4, White can recapture with the queen or knight later.
4. Bc4: Develops a bishop, eyes f7, but doesn't contest the center as directly as Nf3 or d4.

Best practice in the opening is to develop pieces, control the center, and prepare to castle.

**Nf3** is the most principled move, attacking the e5 pawn and preparing to develop other pieces smoothly. It is the main line of the Open Game and keeps all options open.

**d4** is also playable, but after exd4, Qxd4 or Nf3 is possible, but it gives Black a tempo with Nc6.

**Bc4** is playable, but less effective than Nf3.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
Ng1f3
```

2025-07-15 14:59:47,611 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 10.36s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3

It's White to move.

**Position breakdown:**
- Black has played ...d6 and ...e5, establishing a classical pawn center.
- White has played Nf3 and e4, also contesting the center.
- No pieces have been exchanged.
- All minor pieces except Nf3 are on their original squares.

**Legal moves for White:**
Let's enumerate the most relevant ones:
1. d2-d4 (challenging the center)
2. Nc3 (developing a piece)
3. Bc4 (developing a piece, eyeing f7)
4. Bb5+ (check, pinning Nc6 if Black plays it)
5. Be2 (quiet development)
6. h3 (preventing ...Bg4)
7. g3 (preparing Bg2)
8. b3 (preparing Bb2)
9. d3 (solid, but less ambitious)
10. Nf3-g1 (retreat, not logical)
11. Nf3-h4 (not useful)
12. Nf3-e5 (captures pawn, but Black can reply dxe5)

**Critical candidate moves:**
- d4: The most principled, challenging the center immediately.
- Nc3: Developing, but allows ...Nf6 and ...Be7 without contesting the center.
- Bc4: Developing, but Black can play ...Nf6 and ...Be7, and White hasn't challenged the center yet.
- Bb5+: Not very effective since Black can block with ...Bd7 or ...Nc6.

**Tactical considerations:**
- If 3.d4, Black can reply exd4, Nxd4, and White has a strong center.
- If 3.d4, Black can also play ...Nc6, but after dxe5 dxe5, White is fine.
- If 3.Nc3, Black can play ...Nf6, and White hasn't challenged the center.

**Let's calculate 3.d4:**
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 d6
3. d4

- If 3...exd4 4.Nxd4, White has a lead in development and central control.
- If 3...Nc6 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, White has traded queens and Black cannot castle, giving White a small but persistent advantage.
- If 3...Bg4, 4.dxe5 Bxf3 5.Qxf3 dxe5 6.Bc4 Nf6, White is fine.

**Conclusion:**
3.d4 is the most principled, challenging the center and opening lines for development.

**Final move:**
```
d2d4
```
