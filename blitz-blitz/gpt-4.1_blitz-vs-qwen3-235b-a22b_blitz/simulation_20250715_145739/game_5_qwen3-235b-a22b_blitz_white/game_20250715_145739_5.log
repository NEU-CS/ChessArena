You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
We will provide all legal moves and you should analyze the moves and choose one from them. This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-07-15 14:58:24,448 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 4.73s):
Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position after 1.e4. As Black, it's my first move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...e5 (symmetrical, classical, fights for the center)
2. ...c5 (Sicilian Defense, asymmetrical, dynamic)
3. ...e6 (French Defense, solid, prepares d5)
4. ...c6 (Caro-Kann Defense, solid, prepares d5)
5. ...d6 (Pirc/Modern, flexible)
6. ...g6 (Modern/Robatsch, hypermodern)
7. ...d5 (Scandinavian, immediate central challenge)
8. ...Nf6 (Alekhine's Defense, provocative)

**Strategic considerations:**
- 1...e5 is classical, but White can play Ruy Lopez, Italian, Scotch, etc.
- 1...c5 (Sicilian) is the most combative, unbalancing the game and aiming for a win.
- 1...e6 (French) and 1...c6 (Caro-Kann) are solid, but can be passive.
- 1...d5 (Scandinavian) is direct, but can lead to early queen activity for White.

**If I want to maximize winning chances and play for imbalance, the Sicilian Defense is the best choice.**

**Final move:**
```
c7c5
```
