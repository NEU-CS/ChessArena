2025-06-22 00:48:53,197 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.97s):
Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of a chess game. As White, I have the first move. The opening move is critical for establishing control of the center and developing pieces efficiently.

Candidate moves:
1. e2e4 – Opens lines for the queen and bishop, controls the center.
2. d2d4 – Also controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.
3. c2c4 – English Opening, controls the center from the flank.
4. g1f3 – Develops a knight, controls the center.
5. b1c3 – Develops a knight, but less common than Nf3 as a first move.

Among these, 1.e4 is the most popular and statistically successful opening move, controlling the center and allowing for rapid development.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e2e4
```

Let's analyze the position:

1. e4 c6

This is the Caro-Kann Defense, a solid opening for Black. As White, the main lines are to occupy the center and develop pieces naturally. The most principled move is 2. d4, grabbing the center and preparing to develop the knight to f3.

Candidate moves:
- d2d4: Main line, best for central control.
- Nc3: Also playable, but less direct than d4.
- Nf3: Develops a piece, but d4 is more critical.
- c4: Can transpose, but d4 is more flexible.

No tactics to exploit yet, so let's play the main line and seize the center.

Final move:
```
d2d4

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3

**Move history:** 1.e4 c6 2.d4 c5

**Position:**  
- Black has played an early c5, challenging the center.  
- White has a strong center with pawns on e4 and d4.  
- White to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4xc5**: Captures the pawn, gaining a pawn and opening the position. Black can try ...Qa5+ or ...e6 to recover the pawn, but White will have a lead in development.
2. **d4d5**: Advances the pawn, gaining space and closing the center. Black may play ...Nf6 or ...e6.
3. **Ng1f3**: Develops a knight, supports the center, and prepares for kingside castling.
4. **Nb1c3**: Develops a knight, supports d4 and e4.
5. **e4e5**: Advances the pawn, but doesn't seem as strong as the other options.
6. **c2c3**: Supports the d4 pawn, but is passive.

**Analysis:**

- **d4xc5**: If 3.dxc5, Black may play ...Qa5+ (check), but White can block with Nc3, developing a piece. If Black plays ...e6, White can play Be3, defending the pawn. White will have a slight lead in development and a pawn advantage.
- **d4d5**: If 3.d5, Black may play ...d6 or ...Nf6, but White keeps a strong center.
- **Nf3/Nc3**: Both are solid developing moves, but do not address the tension in the center.

**Best move:**  
Capturing on c5 is the most direct way to claim an advantage. White wins a pawn and can defend it, while developing pieces naturally.

**Final move:**
```
d4c5

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 1. e4 c6 2. d4 c5 3. dxc5 e5:**
- Black has sacrificed a pawn for rapid development and central control.
- White is a pawn up, but Black has some initiative.
- White to move.

**Key points:**
- Black threatens ...Bxc5, regaining the pawn with development.
- White's queen and bishop have open lines.
- White can defend the c5 pawn or develop pieces.
- Moves like Nc3, Nf3, and Bc4 are natural.
- c5-c6 is possible, but after ...Nxc6, Black develops quickly.
- d1d5 is a tactical try, but after ...Nc6, Black develops with tempo.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf3**: Develops a piece, prepares to castle, and controls e5/d4.
2. **Nc3**: Develops a piece, supports c5, and controls d5/e4.
3. **Bc4**: Develops a piece, eyes f7, and supports c5.
4. **c4**: Supports c5, but blocks the bishop.
5. **c6**: Pushes the pawn, but after ...Nxc6, Black develops.
6. **Qd5**: Attacks e5, but after ...Nc6, Black gains tempo.

**Deeper analysis:**
- **Nf3** is the most natural, developing and preparing to castle.
- **Nc3** is also good, but Nf3 is more flexible.
- **Bc4** is active, but Nf3 first is more solid.
- **c6** is tempting, but after ...Nxc6, Black has good development.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to develop the kingside knight, keeping options open and preparing to castle. This is the most solid and flexible approach.

2025-06-22 00:51:59,168 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.72s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 4...f6:**
- White: King e1, Queen d1, Rooks a1/h1, Bishops c1/f1, Knights b1/f3, Pawns a2/b2/c2/c5/e4/f2/g2/h2
- Black: King e8, Queen d8, Rooks a8/h8, Bishops c8/f8, Knights b8/g8, Pawns a7/b7/d7/e5/f6/g7/h7

**Material:** Equal.
**Positional features:**
- Black has played ...f6, weakening the e6 and g6 squares and the kingside in general.
- White has a pawn on c5, which cramps Black's queenside and can be supported.
- Black's king is still in the center, and White is ahead in development.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxe5** (f3e5): Immediate central action, attacking the queen and threatening Qh5+ ideas.
2. **Bc4** (f1c4): Develops with tempo, eyeing f7 and the king.
3. **Nc3** (b1c3): Develops, supports d5, and prepares for more central action.
4. **Be3** (c1e3): Develops, supports c5, and eyes the queenside.
5. **Qd5** (d1d5): Centralizes the queen, but may be premature.

**Tactical check:**
- After Nxe5 (f3e5), if fxe5, then Qh5+ g6 Qxe5+ Qe7 Qxh8, White wins a rook.
- If after Nxe5, Black plays Qe7, then Qh5+ Kd8, White can continue development with Nc3, and Black's king is stuck in the center.

**Calculation:**
1. f3e5 fxe5
2. Qh5+ g6
3. Qxe5+ Qe7
4. Qxh8

White wins a rook for a knight and pawn, and Black's king is exposed.

**Conclusion:** Nxe5 is a strong tactical shot, exploiting Black's weakened kingside and lack of development.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/p2p2pp/5p2/1pP1N3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq b6 0 6

**Move history:**  
1. e2e4 c7c6  
2. d2d4 c6c5  
3. d4c5 e7e5  
4. g1f3 f7f6  
5. f3e5 b7b5

**White to move.**

**Material count:**  
Both sides have all pieces, but White has a pawn on c5, Black has a pawn on b5, and White's knight is on e5.

**Position assessment:**
- Black's king is still in the center, and the f6 pawn weakens the kingside.
- White's knight on e5 is very strong, threatening f7 and d7.
- The c5 pawn is advanced and could become a target or a strength.
- Black's queenside is slightly overextended with b5.
- White can consider tactical shots due to Black's weak f6 and f7 squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e5f7** (Nxf7): Attacks the rook on h8 and threatens to fork with Nxh8 or Nd6+. However, after Kxf7, White doesn't have an immediate follow-up, but Black's king is exposed.
2. **d1h5+**: Immediate check, but g6 is available.
3. **d1d5**: Attacks the b5 pawn and pressures the kingside.
4. **c1e3**: Develops and attacks the c5 pawn.
5. **c1g5**: Develops and threatens to take on f6.
6. **f1b5**: Pins the knight on c6, but Black can play Bb7.
7. **c5c6**: Pushes the pawn, but Black can play dxc6.
8. **b1c3**: Develops, but not urgent.

**Tactical calculation for Nxf7:**
- 1. Nxf7 Kxf7 (forced)
- Now, White can play Qd5+ (forking king and rook), but Black can block with Ke8 or Kg6.
- 2. Qd5+ Ke8 (if Kg6, Qf5# is mate)
- If Ke8, Qxa8 wins the rook.

**Let's check this line:**
1. Nxf7 Kxf7
2. Qd5+ Kg6 (if Ke8, Qxa8)
3. Qf5+ Kh6 (if Kf7, Qxa8)
4. Be2 g5
5. h4 Kg7
6. hxg5 fxg5
7. Bxg5

But after 2...Kg6, 3. Qf5+ Kh6, White's attack continues, and Black's king is very exposed.

Alternatively, after 1. Nxf7 Kxf7 2. Qd5+ Ke8 3. Qxa8, White wins a rook.

**Conclusion:**  
Nxf7 is a powerful tactical shot, winning material and exposing Black's king.

**Final move:**
```
e5f7

2025-06-22 00:53:28,874 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.78s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Material: Even.
- Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (rook is gone), queenside is blocked.
- White's knight on f7 is deep in enemy territory, attacking the queen on d8 and rook on h8.
- Black's bishop on a6 is developed, but the rest of Black's pieces are not well coordinated.
- White has a big tactical opportunity: the knight can capture the rook on h8 with check, and then potentially escape or cause further disruption.

Candidate moves:
1. **f7h8**: Knight takes rook with check. Black must respond with ...Ke7 or ...Kf7. After that, the knight may be trapped, but White wins the exchange (rook for knight) and disrupts Black's kingside.
2. **f7d8**: Knight takes queen. Black recaptures with rook or bishop, but White wins the queen for a knight.
3. Other knight moves: f7h6, f7d6, f7g5, f7e5 – none of these are as strong as capturing major material.
4. Other developing moves: Not as urgent as the tactical opportunity.

Let's check the captures:
- **f7d8**: Knight takes queen. Black can recapture with rook or bishop, but White wins a queen for a knight, a decisive material advantage.
- **f7h8**: Knight takes rook with check. Black must move the king, White is up the exchange, but not as much as winning the queen.

Clearly, **f7d8** is the strongest move, winning Black's queen outright.

My move:
```
f7d8
```

2025-06-22 00:54:00,287 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.09s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, Knight, 7 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, Knight, 6 Pawns

**King safety:**
- Black's king is on e7, unable to castle, and is exposed.
- White's king is safe on e1, with castling rights.

**Piece activity:**
- White's knight on d8 is deep in enemy territory, attacking b7 and e6.
- Black's pieces are undeveloped and cramped.
- White's queen and bishop can quickly join the attack.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d8f7** (Knight returns, but loses pressure)
2. **d8b7** (Knight attacks a8 rook and c6, but can be trapped after Bxb7)
3. **d8e6** (Knight attacks c7 and g7, but can be captured by Kxe6)
4. **d8c6** (Knight attacks a7 and b8, but can be captured by Nxc6)
5. **d1d6+** (Queen check, king is forced to f7 or d8, but d6 is not protected)
6. **d1d5** (Queen check, king can go to e8 or d8)
7. **d1h5** (Queen threatens mate on f7, but f7 is covered)
8. **f1b5** (Bishop pins the knight, but not forcing)
9. **e4e5** (Pawn push, attacks f6, opens lines)
10. **c5c6** (Pawn push, attacks b7, opens c-file)

**Critical lines:**
- The Black king is exposed. Let's look for forcing moves: checks, captures, threats.

**Check options:**
- d1d6+ (Queen check)
- d1d5+ (Queen check)

**Let's calculate d1d6+:**
- 1. Qd6+ Kxd8 (forced, since only legal move)
- Now, White can play Nc6+ (forking king and rook), but the king is on d8, so after Nc6+, Ke8, and White can capture a8 rook.

But let's check the line:
1. Qd6+ Kxd8
2. Nc6+ Kc8 (only move)
3. Nxa8 (wins rook)

But after 1...Kxd8, White is up a rook.

**Is there anything better?**
- d1d6+ seems to win material immediately.

**Alternative: d1d5+**
- 1. Qd5+ Ke8 (only move)
- 2. Qxa8 (wins rook, but Black can play Bb7 and trap the queen)

**Conclusion:**
- 1. Qd6+ is the most forcing and wins material.

**Final move:**
```
d1d6
```

- White's king is safe on e1, with castling rights.

**Tactics:**
- White's queen is on d6, deep in enemy territory.
- Black's only developed minor piece is the bishop on a6.
- Black's f8 bishop and g8 knight are undeveloped.
- White has a massive material advantage (up a queen for nothing).

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **d6f8**: Qxf8+ is a forcing move, attacking the king and the rook. If ...Bxf8, White can continue development with tempo.
2. **d6b8**: Qxb8+ wins a rook, but after ...Rxb8, White is still up a queen.
3. **d6e7**: Qe7+ checks, but Black can block with Bxe7.
4. **d6d7**: Qd7+ checks, but Black can block with Nxd7.
5. **Developing moves**: Not urgent, as White can win more material immediately.

**Calculation:**
- After **d6f8** (Qxf8+), Black must play ...Bxf8 (forced), giving up the bishop for the queen. White wins a full rook (f8) for free and remains up a queen for a bishop, with continued attack.

**Conclusion:**
- **d6f8** is the most forcing and decisive move, winning more material and keeping Black's king exposed.

My move:
```
d6f8

2025-06-22 00:54:30,670 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.45s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn3Qnr/p1kp2pp/b4p2/1pP5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 10

- White to move.
- Black's king is on c7, queenside castling is not possible for Black.
- Black's knight is on g8, rook on a8, bishop on a6, pawns on a7, b5, f6, g7, h7.
- White's queen is on f8, king on e1, all pieces are on their original squares except the queen and pawns.
- White has a strong queen on f8, Black's king is exposed on c7.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The queen on f8 is very powerful, and Black's king is exposed.
- The move Qxg8 is possible, but that just wins a knight.
- The move Qd6+ checks the king, but the queen is not on d6.
- The move Qd8+ is not possible.
- The move Qxg7 is not possible.
- The move Qf7+ is not possible.
- The move Qe8+ is not possible.
- The move Qd6+ is not possible.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qxg8: wins a knight, but is it the best?
2. Qd6+: not possible.
3. Qf7+: not possible.
4. Develop pieces: Nc3, Be3, Bf4, etc.
5. c6: pawn push, but not check.
6. Bxb5: not possible.
7. c4: pawn push, but not check.

**Let's check Qxg8:**
- Qxg8 wins a knight, and threatens Qxg7 next, but after Qxg8, Black can play Nc6, developing and defending.
- White will be up a piece, but is there a more forcing move?

**Is there a check?**
- No immediate check with the queen.
- No immediate check with any other piece.

**Is there a mate threat?**
- Not immediately, but after Qxg8, Qxg7 is a threat.

**Is there a better move?**
- Qxg8 seems the most forcing, winning a piece and keeping the initiative.

**Double-check:**
- Qxg8, Black cannot block or capture the queen.
- Next, Qxg7 is a threat, and White can develop calmly.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the knight with the queen, maintaining pressure and material advantage.

2025-06-22 00:55:03,664 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.87s):
Let's analyze the position:

FEN: rnb3Qr/p1kp2pp/5p2/1pP5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 11

White to move.

Material:
- White: Queen (g8), Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Bishop (f1), Knight (b1), King (e1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, c5, e4, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (b8), Knight (b8), King (c7), pawns (a7, b5, f6, g7, h7)

King safety:
- Black's king is on c7, exposed.
- White's queen is on g8, deep in enemy territory.
- White's king is safe on e1.

Threats:
- White's queen is very active, but not immediately threatening mate.
- Black's king is vulnerable.

Candidate moves:
1. Qxg7: Queen captures pawn, threatens mate on g8, but Black can defend with ...Nd7 or ...Bd7.
2. Qf7+: Queen check, but Black can block with ...Nd7 or ...Bd7.
3. Qd5: Queen centralizes, attacks b5 and threatens Qxa8.
4. c6: Pawn push, attacks b7, opens c-file, but Black can play ...Nxc6.
5. Bf4+: Develops bishop with check, but Black can block with ...Kd8 or ...Bd6.
6. Nc3: Develops knight, but not urgent.
7. a4: Attacks b5 pawn, but not urgent.

Let's check the most forcing moves:

- Qxg7: If ...Nd7, then Qxa8, winning the rook.
- Qf7+: If ...Nd7, then Qxa8.
- Qd5: Attacks b5, but not as forcing as Qxg7.

Let's calculate Qxg7:
1. Qxg7 Nd7 (defending a8)
2. Qxa8 Nxc5 (attacking c5 pawn)
3. Qd5 (defending c5, attacking b5)

White wins the rook for a pawn and remains with a huge material advantage.

Alternatively, Qf7+:
1. Qf7+ Nd7 (only move)
2. Qxa8

Same result.

Is there a better move? Let's check for mate threats:
- Qxg7 does not threaten mate, but wins material.
- Qf7+ does not threaten mate, but wins material.

Any other checks? No.

Is there a way to trap the queen? No, Black has no pieces to threaten the queen.

Therefore, the best move is to take the free pawn and threaten the rook:

```
g8xg7
```

2025-06-22 00:55:33,053 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.60s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position (after 11...a6):**
- White: Queen on g7, King on e1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on c1, Knights on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, c5, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on c7, Rook on a8, Bishop on b8, pawns on a6, b5, d7, f6, h7.

**Material:**
- White is up a queen for a bishop and a pawn.
- Black's king is exposed on c7.
- White's queen is very active on g7, eyeing the weak dark squares and the king.

**Immediate threats:**
- White can check on g3, g4, g5, or h6, but none are checks.
- White can try to bring more pieces into the attack.
- Black's king is on c7, and the only defender nearby is the bishop on b8.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxh8**: Captures the rook, but after ...Ba7, the queen could be trapped. Let's check: 12.Qxh8 Ba7 13.Qxf6 Bxc5 14.Qe5+ d6 15.Qe7+ Bd7. White is up a rook and queen for two bishops, but the queen is active.
2. **Qf7**: Retreats the queen, but loses momentum.
3. **Qe7**: Centralizes the queen, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
4. **Qf8**: Retreats, but again, no immediate threat.
5. **Qxh7**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't threaten anything.
6. **Nc3**: Develops, but slow.
7. **Bf4+**: Not possible.
8. **c6**: Pawn push, opening lines, but Black can respond with dxc6.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The Black king is on c7, and the only escape is b7 or d8.
- If White can open the c-file or bring more pieces, it could be decisive.

**Best move:**
- Qxh8 wins a rook, but let's check for traps: after Qxh8, Black has Ba7, but the queen can escape via f6 or e5.
- After Qxh8 Ba7, Qxf6 Bxc5, Qe5+ d6, Qe7+ Bd7, White is up a rook and queen for two bishops, and the attack continues.

Therefore, the best move is to capture the rook:

```
g7h8

2025-06-22 00:55:51,582 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.69s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (White to move):**
- White: King on e1, Queen on h8, Rooks on a1, h1, Bishops on f1, c1, Knights on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, c5, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on c7, Rook on a7, Bishop on b8, Knight on b8, pawns on a6, b5, f6, h7

**Material:**
- White: Up a queen for a rook and a pawn (huge material advantage)
- Black: King is exposed, White's queen is very active

**Threats:**
- White's queen on h8 is very powerful, eyeing squares like f6, g7, h7.
- Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed.
- White can consider bringing more pieces into the attack or centralizing.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qxh7+ — Immediate check, but Black can block with Kd8 or Kc8.
2. Qxf6 — Captures a pawn, threatens Qd6+.
3. Qg7 — Retreats, but not necessary.
4. Bf4+ — Develops with tempo, but Black can block with Kd8.
5. Nc3 — Develops, but not urgent.
6. c6 — Pawn push, but doesn't threaten much.
7. e4-e5 — Opens the center, but not urgent.

**Tactical checks:**
- Qxh7+ Kd8 (if Kb7, Qxb8+ wins a piece)
- Qxf6 — wins a pawn, threatens Qd6+ and Qd8+ ideas.

**Calculation:**
- Qxh7+ Kd8 (if Kb7, Qxb8+ wins a piece)
- Qxf6 — wins a pawn, no immediate mate, but keeps pressure.

**Best move:**
- Qxb8+ is possible if Black's king moves to b7 after Qxh7+.
- Qxh7+ is forcing and wins material after Kb7 Qxb8+.

**Let's check Qxh7+:**
1. Qxh7+ Kd8 (if Kb7, Qxb8+)
2. Qg8+ (not possible, queen on h7)
So after Qxh7+ Kd8, White can continue developing.

But Qxf6 is clean, wins a pawn, threatens Qd6+.

**Final evaluation:**
- Qxf6 is safe, wins a pawn, keeps threats.
- Qxh7+ is forcing, but after Kd8, no immediate follow-up.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
h8f6
```

2025-06-22 00:56:06,624 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.56s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (f6), Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (b1), all pawns except d-pawn.
- Black: Rook (a7), Bishop (b8), Knight (b8), pawns a6, b5, c7, h5.

**King Safety:**
- White's king is safe on e1.
- Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed.

**Threats:**
- White's queen is very active on f6, eyeing c6, e5, and threatening f7.
- Black's pieces are mostly passive, but the rook on a7 and bishop/knight on b8 are defending.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qe7+ (forces the king to b7 or c8, but after ...Kb7, White can play Be3 or Nc3, but no immediate win)
2. Qd6+ (forces Kb7, then Qd5+ and Qxa7, but Black can defend)
3. Qc3 (threatening Qc6+ and mate ideas)
4. Nc3 (developing, threatens Nxb5+)
5. Be3 (developing, threatens Bxa7)
6. c6 (pawn push, but Black can take with bishop or rook)
7. Qe5+ (forces Kd8, then Qh8+ and Qxb8, but Black can play Kd8 and defend)

**Tactical checks:**
- Qe7+ Kb7 Qd8 (threatening mate, but Black has Nc6)
- Qd6+ Kb7 Qd5+ Nc6 Qxa7+ Nxa7

**Best move:**
- Qd6+ looks strong, as it forces the king to b7, then Qd5+ picks up the rook on a7 or continues the attack.

Let's check Qd6+:
1. Qd6+ Kb7
2. Qd5+ Nc6 (forced)
3. Qxa7+ Nxa7

White wins the exchange and remains with a strong attack.

Alternatively, Qe7+ Kb7 Qd8 (threatening mate), but Black can defend with Nc6.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Qd6+ Kb7 Qd5+ Nc6 Qxa7+ Nxa7, White is up material and has a winning position.

Therefore, the best move is:
```

2025-06-22 00:56:15,087 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.94s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (White to move):**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d6, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c1, Knights on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, c5, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on d8, Rook on a7, Bishop on b8, pawns on a6, b5, d7, h5

**Material:**
- White is up a queen for a rook and a pawn (significant material advantage).
- Black's king is on d8, somewhat exposed, with the queen on d6 very close.

**Tactical Motifs:**
- The Black king is on d8, with the queen on d6. The bishop on b8 and rook on a7 are somewhat defensive, but the king is vulnerable.
- White's queen on d6 is very active, and White has a huge initiative.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qxb8** (d6b8): Captures the bishop, threatening to win more material and possibly invade the 8th rank.
2. **Qf8+** (d6f8): Forces the king to move (only legal is c7), then White can continue the attack.
3. **Qd7+** (d6d7): Forces the king to move (only legal is c7), but then the queen can take the rook on a7.
4. **Qe7** (d6e7): Not as forcing.
5. **Qd5** (d6d5): Not as forcing.
6. **Qh6** (d6h6): Not as forcing.

Let's analyze the most forcing moves:

### 1. Qf8+ (d6f8)
- Black's only legal move is Kc7.
- After Kc7, White can play Bf4+ (developing with tempo), or Qd6+ (repeat), or Qxb8 (win bishop).
- Let's see: 1. Qf8+ Kc7 2. Qxb8+ Kxb8 3. Bf4+ (check), but Black can block with d6. Still, White is up a rook and a pawn for a queen, a decisive advantage.

### 2. Qxb8 (d6b8)
- Captures the bishop, threatens Qxa7 next.
- Black can respond with Rb7, but White can play Qxa6, winning another pawn.
- This is a clean win of material.

### 3. Qd7+ (d6d7)
- Forces Kc7, then Qxa7+ (winning the rook).
- 1. Qd7+ Kc7 2. Qxa7+ Bxa7 (if Black takes), but then White is up a full piece.

### 4. Qd6d7+ Kc7 Qxa7+ Bxa7
- White is up a piece and a pawn, with a winning endgame.

### 5. Qd6b8
- Just wins a piece outright.

### Evaluation:
- **Qxb8** (d6b8) wins a piece outright, with no counterplay for Black.
- **Qd7+** (d6d7) wins a rook, but after Qxa7+ Bxa7, White is up a piece.
- **Qf8+** (d6f8) is forcing, but after Kc7, White can just take on b8 anyway.

**Conclusion:** The most direct and cleanest is to take the bishop with Qxb8 (d6b8), winning a piece and keeping the initiative.

**Final move:**
```
d6b8
```

2025-06-22 00:56:26,574 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.98s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (b8), Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (b1), Bishop (f1), King (e1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, c5, e4, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: Rook (c7), Bishop (d8), King (d7), pawns (a6, b5, h5)

**Key points:**
- White is up a queen for a rook and bishop (decisive material advantage).
- Black's king is on d7, somewhat exposed.
- White's queen on b8 is very active.
- White has a passed pawn on c5.
- Black's rook and bishop are somewhat passive.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxc7** (b8c7): Queen captures rook, winning more material.
2. **Qb7+** (b8b7): Check, but Black can block with Bc7.
3. **Qd6+** (b8d6): Check, but Black can block with Kc8 or Ke8.
4. **c6+** (c5c6): Pawn push, but Black can play Kxc6.
5. **Developing moves** (b1c3, f1e2, etc.): Not urgent, as we have a direct capture.

**Tactical check:**
- After **b8c7** (Qxc7+), Black must recapture with the king (Kxc7), as the bishop is pinned to the king.
- After Kxc7, White can continue with cxd6+, winning the bishop next.

**Calculation:**
1. b8c7 Qxc7+ Kxc7
2. cxd6+ Kxd6 (if Kxd6)
   - White is up a full queen for a bishop and pawn, with a winning endgame.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to capture the rook with check, winning more material and simplifying the position.

My move:
```
b8c7

- White is up a queen for a bishop and a pawn (decisive material advantage).

**Threats:**
- White's queen is very active on c7.
- Black's king is on e8, with only a bishop on c8 and pawns for defense.
- White can consider direct threats: Qxc8+, Qe5+, Qd6, etc.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qxc8+ (captures bishop, forces K moves)
2. Qe5+ (centralizes queen, checks king)
3. Qd6 (threatens mate ideas)
4. Qc6 (threatens mate on c8)
5. Qd8+ (forces Kf7, then Qxc8)
6. Develop pieces (but direct attack is better)

**Analysis:**
- Qxc8+ wins a piece and keeps up the attack. After Qxc8+ Kf7 (forced), White can continue with Qxc8, then develop pieces and push for mate.
- Qe5+ is interesting but after Kf7, White doesn't have a direct follow-up.
- Qd8+ Kf7, Qxc8 wins a piece, similar to Qxc8+.
- Qc6 (no check), but threatens mate on c8, but Black can defend with d6.

**Best move:**
- Qxc8+ is the most forcing and wins material, keeping Black's king exposed.

**Final move:**
```
c7c8
```

2025-06-22 00:56:50,619 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.44s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2Q5/3pk3/p7/1pP4p/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 18

**White to move.**

**Material:**  
White: Queen, Rooks (a1, h1), Bishop (c1), Knight (b1), pawns  
Black: King (e7), Bishop (f8), pawns

**King safety:**  
Black's king is on e7, somewhat exposed.  
White's king is safe on e1 with both castling rights.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White's queen is on c8, very active.
- Black's king is on e7, and the bishop is on f8, possibly blocking escape squares.
- White can consider moves like Qc5+ or Qd8+ to harass the king.
- White can also consider castling to bring the rook into play.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qc7+ (forces the king to move, as d7 is covered by the queen)
2. Qc5+ (forces the king to move)
3. Qxa6 (wins a pawn, but less forcing)
4. Castling (to bring the rook into play)
5. Nc3 (develops a piece)
6. c6 (pawn push, but not urgent)

Let's check Qc7+:

- 18. Qc7+ Ke8 (if Kf6, Qf4# is mate)
- 18... Ke6 (if Kf6, Qf4# is mate)
- 18... Ke8, then Qxb8 (wins bishop)
- 18... Kf6, Qf4# is mate

But wait, let's check Qc5+:

- 18. Qc5+ Ke8 (if Kf6, Qf4# is mate)
- 18... Ke6, Qf5# is mate

But Qc5+ Ke8, then Qxb8, winning the bishop.

Alternatively, Qxd7+ is not possible, as d7 is not occupied.

Let's check Qc7+:

- 18. Qc7+ Ke8 (if Kf6, Qf4# is mate)
- 18... Ke6, Qf5# is mate

So, Qc7+ is a forcing move, and if Kf6, Qf4# is mate. If Ke8, Qxb8 wins the bishop.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c8c7
```

2025-06-22 00:56:57,114 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.87s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on c7, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on c1, Knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, c5, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on f7, pawn on d7, a6, b5, h5.

**Material:**
- White is up a queen for a rook and has a strong initiative.

**Threats:**
- White's queen is very active on c7.
- Black's king is exposed on f7.
- Black's only real threat is the passed d7 pawn, but it is blockaded.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qxd7** (c7d7): Captures the dangerous passed pawn, removing Black's only real counterplay.
2. **Qe5** (c7e5): Centralizes the queen, threatens mate on g7, and attacks the h5 pawn.
3. **Qf4+** (c7f4): Immediate check, but Black can block with Ke8 or Kg8.
4. **c6** (c5c6): Pushes the passed pawn, but not urgent.
5. **e5** (e4e5): Opens lines, but not urgent.

**Analysis:**
- **Qxd7**: After this, Black has no more passed pawns, and White can proceed to attack the king with no risk.
- **Qe5**: Threatens mate, but Black can defend with ...Rg8 or ...Kg8.
- **Qf4+**: Not as forcing; Black can escape.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to eliminate Black's only counterplay by capturing the d7 pawn.

2025-06-22 00:57:04,018 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.16s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5k2/3Q4/p7/1pP4p/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 20

**Material:**  
White: Queen, both rooks, both bishops, both knights, 7 pawns  
Black: King, 6 pawns

**White to move.**

**Immediate tactical checks:**
- The Black king is on f8, with no immediate threats to White.
- White's queen is on d7, dominating the 7th rank.
- White has a huge material advantage (a full queen up).
- Black has no pieces except pawns.
- White has a passed c-pawn and a dominating position.

**Candidate moves:**
- Look for forced mates or ways to win more material.
- d7e8+ (queen check): King only has e8 as a square, but after ...Kxe8, White can recapture with rook or bishop, but that trades the queen for nothing, so not optimal.
- d7d8: Queen to d8, but doesn't threaten anything new.
- d7h7: Queen to h7, threatening mate on h8, but Black can play ...Kg8.
- d7g7: Queen to g7, threatening Qf7#, but f7 is covered by the king.
- d7f7: Queen to f7, but that's not a legal move (f7 is occupied by Black king).
- d7e7: Queen to e7, not threatening anything immediate.
- d7c7: Queen to c7, not threatening anything.
- d7e6: Queen to e6, threatening Qf7#.
- d7f5: Queen to f5, threatening Qf7#.
- d7g4: Queen to g4, threatening Qf4+.
- d7h3: Queen to h3, threatening Qh8+.
- c5c6: Push the passed pawn.

**Check for forced mate:**
- d7e6: Queen to e6, threatens Qf7# (mate).
- Black cannot stop Qf7# (no pieces to block, no way to escape).
- Therefore, d7e6 is a direct threat of mate in one.

**Does Black have any way to stop Qf7# after d7e6?**
- No, Black cannot block f7, and the king cannot escape.

**Conclusion:**  
The move d7e6 is a direct threat of mate in one (Qf7#), and Black cannot prevent it.

**Final move:**
```
d7e6
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Queen, both rooks, both bishops, both knights, 7 pawns  
Black: King, 5 pawns

**King safety:**  
Black's king is on f8, boxed in by its own pawns and White's queen.  
White's king is safe.

**Threats:**  
White is massively ahead in material and has a queen on e6, with the Black king on f8.  
White can deliver checkmate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**  
- e6g8 (Qe6-g8#): This is checkmate, as the Black king cannot escape to any square, and there are no pieces to block or capture the queen.

**Double-check:**  
- e6g8: Black king on f8, squares e7, f7, g7, e8, g8, g7, h8, h7 are all covered or occupied. No Black piece can interpose or capture the queen.

**Conclusion:**  
Qe6-g8 is checkmate.

2025-06-22 00:57:18,665 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.61s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, Rook on a1, Bishop on f1, Knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, c5, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on g8, pawns on a5, b5, h5

**Position:**
- White has a healthy material advantage (extra minor piece and rook).
- Black's pawns on the queenside are advanced, but White's c5 pawn is blockading them.
- White's king is safe, and all pieces are on the board.
- White has a huge advantage and should press for a win.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **c5c6**: Pushes the passed pawn, threatens to create a passed pawn on the queenside.
2. **b1c3**: Develops the knight, supports the c5 pawn, and prepares to bring more pieces into play.
3. **f1xb5**: Captures the pawn, but the bishop is not yet developed.
4. **c1g5/h6**: Develops the bishop, possibly eyeing the kingside.
5. **e4e5**: Gains space in the center, but not urgent.
6. **h1g1**: Connects the rooks, but not urgent.

**Deeper Analysis:**
- **c5c6**: If Black plays b4, White can play c7, threatening to promote. If Black plays a4, White can play c7, and after b3, c8=Q. Black cannot stop the pawn.
- **b1c3**: Develops, but not as forcing as c5c6.
- **f1xb5**: Bishop can be captured by a4, so not optimal.

**Conclusion:**
- **c5c6** is the most forcing move, immediately threatening to create a passed pawn and promote. Black cannot stop the pawn without heavy losses.

My move:
```
c5c6

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rooks a1, h1; Bishop c1; Knight b1; King e1; Pawns a2, b2, c2, c6, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King f8; Pawns a5, b5, h5

**Position:**
- White is up a full piece and has a dangerous passed pawn on c6.
- Black's king is boxed in and has no active counterplay.
- White can push c7, threatening to promote, and Black cannot stop the pawn without losing material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c6-c7: Immediate threat to promote, Black cannot stop c8=Q.
2. Develop pieces (but c7 is more urgent).
3. e4-e5: Not as urgent as c7.
4. Other pawn moves: Not relevant.

**Calculation:**
- After c7, Black cannot stop c8=Q. If ...Ke7, then c8=Q.
- Black has no checks, no threats.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the passed pawn.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, rook on a1, bishop on f1, knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, c7, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on f8, pawns on a4, b5, h5

**White to move.**

**Key points:**
- White has a pawn on c7, one step from promotion.
- Black's king is on f8, too far to stop the c-pawn.
- White can promote immediately with c7-c8=Q (or another piece).
- Black has no immediate threats.
- After promotion, White will have a decisive material advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c7c8q (promote to queen)
2. c7c8r (promote to rook)
3. c7c8b (promote to bishop)
4. c7c8n (promote to knight)

Promoting to a queen is the most straightforward and strongest option. There are no stalemate tricks or perpetual checks available to Black.

**Final move:**
```
c7c8q

2025-06-22 00:57:42,999 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.96s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: Queen on c8, King on e1, Rook on a1 and h1, Bishop on c1 and f1, Knights on b1, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on f7, Pawn on a4, b5, h5.

**Material:** White is up a queen for a rook and has a huge material advantage.

**Threats:**
- White can deliver checks with the queen.
- Black's king is exposed on f7.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qf5+ (not available, but Qc7+ is not legal, but Qc8-f5 is possible via Qc8f5)
2. Qc8c7+ (not legal, as c7 is occupied by Black's pawn)
3. Qc8e6+ (possible, attacking king and pawn)
4. Qc8f5+ (possible, attacking king and pawn)
5. Qc8h8 (possible, but not a check)
6. Qc8g8 (possible, not a check)
7. Qc8c7 (possible, but not a check)
8. Qc8d7 (possible, not a check)

**Best checks:**
- Qc8e6+ (forces the king to move, as the only legal move is Kf8)
- Qc8f5+ (forces the king to move, as the only legal move is Ke7)

Let's check Qc8e6+:
- ...Kf8 (only move)
- Then Qe6f6+ (forces Kg8)
- Qf6g6+ (forces Kf8)
- Qg6h6 (threatening mate on h8, but Black can play h4)

Alternatively, Qc8f5+:
- ...Ke7 (only move)
- Qf5e5+ (forces Kd8 or Kf7)
- If Kd8, Qe5d6+ wins the a4 pawn, but not immediate mate.

Alternatively, Qc8e6+:
- ...Kf8
- Qe6f6+ Kg8
- Qf6g6+ Kf8
- Qg6h6 (threatening mate on h8)
- Black can try h4, but then Qh8# is mate.

Let's check this line:
1. Qc8e6+ Kf8
2. Qe6f6+ Kg8
3. Qf6g6+ Kf8
4. Qg6h6 h4
5. Qh6h8# (checkmate)

This is forced mate in 5.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c8e6
```

2025-06-22 00:57:51,394 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.47s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (e6), Rook (a1), Bishop (c1, f1), Knight (b1), King (e1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: King (g7), pawns (a4, b5, h5)

**White to move.**

**King safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on g7.
- White's queen is very active on e6.

**Threats:**
- White can deliver checks with the queen.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qe6-g8+ (forces Kg8xg8, but then White can develop or attack)
2. Qe6-e7+ (forces Kg7-h6, then Qe7-f6# is mate)
3. Qe6-d7 (attacks b5, but not forcing)
4. Qe6-f5 (threatens Qf5xh5, but not forcing)
5. Qe6-h6+ (forces Kg7xh6, then White can continue attack)
6. Qe6-g4+ (forces Kg7-h6, then Qg4-f4+ is possible)

Let's check the most forcing moves:

**1. Qe6-g8+**
- Black is forced to take: Kg7xg8.
- White can then play Bxb5 (winning a pawn), but this is not decisive.

**2. Qe6-e7+**
- Black's only move is Kg7-h6.
- Then Qe7-f6# is checkmate.

**3. Qe6-h6+**
- Black is forced to take: Kg7xh6.
- White can then play Bxb5, but again, not decisive.

**4. Qe6-g4+**
- Black's only move is Kg7-h6.
- Then Qg4-f4+ is check, but Black can block with Kg6.

**So, Qe6-e7+ is a forced mate in one.**

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e6e7
```

2025-06-22 00:58:01,754 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.88s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Queen (e7), all minor pieces, all pawns except c2  
Black: King (g6), pawns on b5, h5, a4

**King safety:**  
Black's king is exposed on g6, with no defenders nearby.  
White's queen is very active and can deliver checks.

**Immediate tactics:**  
- e7g5+ is a check, but the king can go to h7 or f7.  
- e7e8 is a queen retreat, but not forcing.  
- e7f8 is a check, but the king can go to h7.  
- e7h4 is a check, king goes to h6.  
- e7e6 is a check, but king goes to g7.

But let's look for the most forcing moves.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. Qe7g5+  
   - Kg7, Qg5xh5, but then Black can try b4 and push pawns.
2. Qe7e6+  
   - Kg7, Qe6xe5+, Kh6, Qe5xb5, but Black's king escapes.
3. Qe7f8+  
   - Kg5-h7, Qf8-f7+ (forces king to h6), Qf7-f6+ (forces king to h7), Qf6-g5 (mate threat), but Black can interpose with h4.
4. Qe7h4  
   - Kg6-h6, Qh4-f6+ (forces king to h7), Qf6-g5 (mate threat), but again Black can interpose with h4.

But let's check if there is a forced mate:

**Line: Qe7g5+**
- 1. Qg5+ Kf7 (if Kh7, Qxh5+ Kg7 Qg5+ Kf7 Qxh5+)
- 1... Kh7 2. Qxh5+ Kg7 3. Qg5+ Kf7 4. Qxh5+ (repeats)
- 1... Kf7 2. Qxh5+ Ke6 3. Qf5+ Kd6 4. Qd5+ Kc7 5. Qxb5

Not a forced mate, but wins more pawns.

**Line: Qe7e6+**
- 1. Qe6+ Kg7 2. Qe5+ Kh6 3. Qxb5

Again, not a forced mate.

**Line: Qe7f8+**
- 1. Qf8+ Kh7 2. Qf7+ Kh6 3. Qf6+ Kh7 4. Qg5

Again, not a forced mate.

**Line: Qe7h4**
- 1. Qh4 Kh6 2. Qf6+ Kh7 3. Qg5

No forced mate.

**Line: Qe7g7**
- 1. Qg7+ Kxg7

No.

**Is there a way to trap the king?**

If we play Qe7g5+, the king is forced to f7 or h7.

- 1. Qg5+ Kf7 2. Qxh5+ Ke6 3. Qf5+ Kd6 4. Qd5+ Kc7 5. Qxb5

White is up a queen and can mop up the pawns. Black has no counterplay.

**Is there a better move?**

What about Qe7d6+?
- 1. Qd6+ Kg5 2. Qe5+ Kh6 3. Qxb5

No forced mate.

**What about Qe7e5+?**
- 1. Qe5+ Kh6 2. Qxb5

No forced mate.

**What about Qe7e8?**
- Not forcing.

**What about Qe7h7?**
- 1. Qh7+ Kxh7

No.

**What about Qe7b4?**
- 1. Qb4, not forcing.

**What about Qe7c5?**
- 1. Qc5, not forcing.

**What about Qe7g5+?**
- 1. Qg5+ Kf7 2. Qxh5+ Ke6 3. Qf5+ Kd6 4. Qd5+ Kc7 5. Qxb5

This is the most forcing line, winning more pawns and keeping the king exposed.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play the forcing check:

```
e7g5
```

2025-06-22 00:58:10,542 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.24s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/8/1p4Qp/p3P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 7 28

- Material: White has a queen, both rooks, both bishops, both knights, and all pawns except the a-pawn. Black has only a king and pawns (no queen, no rooks, no bishops, no knights).
- Black's king is on f7, White's queen is on g5.
- Black's pawns: b5, h5, a4, e4.
- White's pawns: a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, e4, (missing a3, d2, g3, h3, etc.)

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- Black's king is exposed on f7.
- White's queen is very active on g5.
- White has a huge material advantage.
- White can check on g8, g7, h5, f6, f5, e5, etc.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5g8+** (Queen to g8, check)
   - King must go to f6 or e7 (only legal moves).
2. **g5g7+** (Queen to g7, check)
   - King must go to e6 or e8.
3. **g5f6+** (Queen to f6, check)
   - King must go to e8 or g8.
4. **g5h5+** (Queen to h5, check)
   - King must go to f8 or g8.
5. **g5e5** (Queen to e5, check)
   - King must go to g8 or f8.

**Let's check the most forcing move:**
- **g5g8+**: King can only go to f6 or e7.
   - If ...Kf6, then Qg8+ Kf6 Qg6# is mate.
   - If ...Ke7, then Qg7+ Ke6 Qg6# is mate.

Let's check the mate sequence:
1. Qg8+ Kf6
2. Qg6#

**This is checkmate.**

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g5g8

2025-06-22 00:58:20,580 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.72s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- White: Queen on g8, King on f6, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, f1, Knight on b1, King on e1, rook h1.
- Black: King on f6, pawns on a4, b5, h5.

**Material:** White is up a queen for nothing, and Black's king is exposed on f6. White's queen is on g8, cutting off the king's escape squares.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- The Black king is on f6, and the queen is on g8. Let's check for forced mates.
- The king's escape squares: e5, e6, f7, g7, g6, g5, e7, f5, g4, h5, h6, h7, h8, etc.
- But the queen on g8 covers the 8th rank and the g-file.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. Qg8h8+ (forces the king to move, but where?)
2. Qg8f8+ (forces the king to e5 or g5)
3. Qg8e8+ (forces the king to g5 or e5)
4. Qg8d8+ (forces the king to e5)
5. Qg8g7+ (forces the king to f7)
6. Qg8g6+ (forces the king to e5)
7. Qg8g5+ (forces the king to e5)
8. Qg8g4+ (forces the king to e5)
9. Qg8g3+ (forces the king to e5)
10. Qg8g1+ (forces the king to e5)

But let's check if any of these are mate or lead to mate.

**Check for Forced Mate:**

- Qg8h8+:
  - King can only go to e6 (since f7, g7, g6, g5 are covered by the queen, and h7 is not accessible).
  - But h8 is not a check, since the king is on f6.

- Qg8f8+:
  - King can go to g5 or e5.
  - If K moves to g5, then Qf4# is mate.
  - If K moves to e5, then Qf4+ is check, but not mate.

- Qg8e8+:
  - King can go to g5 or e5.
  - If K moves to g5, then Qf4# is mate.
  - If K moves to e5, then Qg5# is mate.

- Qg8g7+:
  - King can only go to f7.
  - Then Qg7f7# is mate.

- Qg8g6+:
  - King can only go to e5.
  - Then Qg6g5# is mate.

- Qg8g5+:
  - King can only go to e5.
  - Then Qg5g4# is mate.

- Qg8d8+:
  - King can only go to e5.
  - Then Qd8d5# is mate.

- Qg8g4+:
  - King can only go to e5.
  - Then Qg4g5# is mate.

- Qg8g3+:
  - King can only go to e5.
  - Then Qg3g5# is mate.

- Qg8g1+:
  - King can only go to e5.
  - Then Qg1g5# is mate.

But let's verify: After Qg8g7+, Black's only move is Kf7, then Qg7f7# is mate.

**Conclusion:** Qg8g7+ is a forced mate in 1.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g8g7
```

2025-06-22 00:58:29,674 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.70s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on g7, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishops on c1 and f1, Knights on b1, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e6, Pawns on a4, b5, h5

**Black's king is exposed on e6. White's queen is on g7, controlling the 7th rank and threatening the king. White has a huge material advantage and total control.**

**Immediate tactical opportunities:**
- Is there a forced mate?
- Can we win more material or force the king into a mating net?

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qg7g8+**: Forces the king to f7 or e7. But f7 is covered by the queen, so only e7.
2. **Qg7h6+**: King can go to f7 or e5.
3. **Qg7g6+**: King can go to e7 or e5.
4. **Qg7h7**: Not a check, but threatens Qh6+.
5. **Qg7f8**: Not a check, but threatens Qf5+.

**Let's check Qg7g8+:**
- 1. Qg8+ Ke7 (only move)
- Then 2. Qg5+ (check), king must go to e6 or f7.
- If 2...Ke6, then Qf5# is mate.
- If 2...Kf7, then Qf5+ Ke8 Qf8# is mate.

But after 1. Qg8+ Ke7, 2. Qg5+ Ke6, 3. Qf5# is checkmate.

**Therefore, Qg7g8+ is a forced mate in two.**

**Final move:**
```
g7g8

2025-06-22 00:58:38,008 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.59s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on g8, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on c1, Knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on f6, pawns on a4, b5, h5.

**White to move.**

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The Black king is exposed on f6.
- The White queen on g8 is extremely active, cutting off the 8th rank and threatening to invade.
- Black's only defenders are pawns, and the king is vulnerable to checks and mating nets.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8g5+**: Queen check on g5. King must move.
   - If ...Kf7, then Qg7+ and the king is forced back.
   - If ...Ke6, then Qf5+ and the king is driven further.
   - If ...Ke6, Qf5+ Kd6, Qd5+ etc. The king is chased.
2. **g8h8**: Queen to h8, threatening Qh6+ and mate ideas, but not immediate.
3. **g8f8**: Queen to f8, threatening Qf6#, but the king is on f6.
4. **g8d8**: Queen to d8, threatening Qd6+.
5. **e4e5+**: Pawn check, but Black can play Kxe5.

**Let's check the most forcing move:**
- **g8g5+**: King must move.
   - ...Kf7: Qg7+ Ke6 (forced), Qf5+ Kd6, Qd5+ Kc7, Qc5+ Kb7, Qxb5+ and White wins material and keeps attacking.
   - ...Ke6: Qf5+ Kd6, Qd5+ Kc7, Qc5+ Kb7, Qxb5+ and again White wins.

**Is there a mate in 2 or 3?**
- After g8g5+ Kf7 Qg7+ Ke6 Qf5+ Kd6 Qd5+ Kc7 Qc5+ Kb7 Qxb5+ Ka7 Qxa4+ Kb6 Qb4+ Kc6 Qxa4+ Kd6 Qd4+ Ke6 Qd5+ Kf6, and the king is chased forever.

**Is there a more direct mate?**
- **g8g6+**: King must go to e7 or e5.
   - ...Ke7: Qg7+ Ke6 Qg6+ Ke7 Qg5+ Ke6 Qf5+ Kd6 Qd5+ Kc7 Qc5+ Kb7 Qxb5+ and so on.
   - ...Ke5: Qg5+ Kd4 Qd5#

**Let's check g8g6+ Ke5 Qg5+ Kd4 Qd5#**

So, **g8g6+** is a forced mate in 2!

**Final move:**
```
g8g6
```

2025-06-22 00:58:47,073 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.43s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on g6, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on c1, Knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e5, pawns on a4, b5, h5.

**Material:** White is up a queen for nothing. Black's king is exposed on e5, with no pieces to defend. White has a massive material and positional advantage.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate?
- The Black king is on e5, with no escape squares except possibly d4, f4, d6, f6, d5, f5, but most are covered by the queen or blocked by pawns.
- Let's check the checks:

1. **g6g8**: Queen to g8, no check.
2. **g6e8**: Queen to e8, no check.
3. **g6h7**: Queen to h7, no check.
4. **g6g7**: Queen to g7, no check.
5. **g6f7**: Queen to f7, no check.
6. **g6h6**: Queen to h6, no check.
7. **g6f6**: Queen to f6, no check.
8. **g6e6**: Queen to e6, check. Black king can move to f4 or d4.
9. **g6d6**: Queen to d6, check. Black king can move to e4 or f5.
10. **g6c6**: Queen to c6, check. Black king can move to f4 or d4.
11. **g6b6**: Queen to b6, check. Black king can move to f4 or d4.
12. **g6a6**: Queen to a6, check. Black king can move to f4 or d4.
13. **g6h5**: Queen to h5, check. Black king can move to d4 or f4.
14. **g6g5**: Queen to g5, check. Black king can move to d4 or f4.
15. **g6f5**: Queen to f5, check. Black king can move to d4 or f4.
16. **g6g4**: Queen to g4, check. Black king can move to d4 or f4.
17. **g6g3**: Queen to g3, check. Black king can move to d4 or f4.

Let's analyze the most forcing checks:

**1. g6e6+**
- King can go to f4 or d4.
- If Kf4, then Qf5# is mate.
- If Kd4, then Qd5# is mate.

**So, g6e6+ is a forced mate in one!**

Let's double-check:
- After g6e6+, if Kf4, Qf5#.
- If Kd4, Qd5#.
- If Kd6, not possible (queen covers).
- If Kf6, not possible (queen covers).
- If Ke4, not possible (queen covers).
- If Kd5, not possible (queen covers).
- If Kf5, not possible (queen covers).

**Conclusion:** g6e6+ is a forced mate in one.

**Final move:**
```
g6e6
```

2025-06-22 00:58:57,632 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.06s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (Ke6):**
- White pawns: a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black pawns: a4, b5, h5
- White pieces: Ra1, Bc1, Bf1, Ke1, Nb1
- Black king: e6

**Material:**
- White is up a bishop and a knight for two pawns.
- Black's king is centralized, but White has a massive material advantage.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- White should avoid any tricks, keep the king safe, and activate pieces.
- The only way Black could hope for counterplay is by pushing the a- or b-pawns, or by trying to create a passed pawn on the kingside.
- White should develop pieces and prepare to centralize the king, while keeping an eye on Black's queenside pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b1c3** (develop knight, controls center, eyes b5 and d5)
2. **f1xb5** (bishop takes b5, wins a pawn, but bishop could be exposed)
3. **c1h6** (develop bishop, eyes g7, but not urgent)
4. **e4e5** (gain space, but Black's king is already on e6)
5. **h1g1** (connect rooks, but not urgent)
6. **c2c4** (attack b5, but not as direct as piece development)
7. **a2a3** (attack a4, but not urgent)

**Deeper analysis:**
- **f1xb5**: If 1.Bxb5, Black cannot trap the bishop (no a3 pawn). White wins a pawn and threatens to take a4 next. 
- **b1c3**: Develops a piece, but does not immediately win material.
- **c2c4**: Attacks b5, but Black can play ...b4, and White's knight is still undeveloped.

**Best move:**
- **Bxb5** is safe and wins a pawn. After 1.Bxb5, White threatens to take a4 next. Black cannot trap the bishop, and White can continue developing with Nc3, Be3, and O-O if needed.

**Final move:**
```
f1b5

2025-06-22 00:59:09,240 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.47s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on e1, rook on a1, bishop on b5, knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e7, pawn on a4, h5

**Material:** White is up a piece and has a dominating position. Black has two pawns for the piece, but White's pieces are active and Black's king is exposed.

**Threats:**
- White threatens to invade with the bishop, rook, or knight.
- Black's only real hope is to push pawns or try for counterplay, but White's king is safe and pieces are coordinated.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5e8** (Bishop to e8): Pins the king to the back rank, but doesn't threaten immediate tactics.
2. **b5d7** (Bishop to d7): Attacks the king, but the king can move.
3. **b5c6** (Bishop to c6): Attacks the a4 pawn and controls key squares.
4. **e1e2** (King to e2): Centralizes the king, but not urgent.
5. **e1g1** (Castle kingside): Possible, but not necessary.
6. **e4e5** (Pawn push): Gains space, restricts the king.
7. **a2a3** (Pawn): Prepares to win the a4 pawn.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The a4 pawn is weak and can be attacked.
- The h5 pawn is far from queening and not dangerous.
- White can play for a quick invasion with the bishop and rook.

**Best move:**
- **b5c6** attacks the a4 pawn, threatens to win it, and keeps all options open. Black cannot defend the pawn, and White will soon be up a full piece with no compensation for Black.

Therefore, after careful consideration, the best move is:
```
b5c6
```

2025-06-22 00:59:19,775 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.79s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on e1, rook on a1, bishop on c6, bishop on c1, knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on d8, pawn on a4, h5

**Material:**
- White is up a full bishop and has a dominating position.

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is on d8, with no immediate threats to White's king.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- The bishop on c6 can deliver a check on e8 or a8.
- Let's check if any of these checks are decisive.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. c6e8+ (Bishop check)
   - Black must play ...Kc7 or ...Kc8 (since d8 is the only square for the king, but it's already there).
   - Let's see: after c6e8+, Black's only legal move is ...Kc7.
2. c6a8+ (Bishop check)
   - Black must play ...Kc7.
3. c6d5 (centralizing bishop, but not as forcing as a check)
4. Develop other pieces or push pawns, but checks are more forcing.

**Let's calculate c6e8+:**
- 1. Bc6-e8+ Kd8-c7 (forced)
- Now, White can play Bf4+ (with the other bishop), but Black can block with Bd6.
- Alternatively, White can play Nc3, preparing Nb5+.

But let's check if there is a more direct win.

**After c6e8+ Kc7:**
- White can play Nc3, threatening Nb5+.
- Black has no real threats.

**Alternatively, c6a8+ Kc7:**
- Similar situation.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Not immediately, but White is completely winning.

**Is there a way to win material?**
- Not immediately, but White can keep pressing.

**Should we exchange bishops?**
- No need; White's bishops are dominating.

**Best move:**
- Deliver a check with the bishop to force the king to c7, then continue development and prepare to bring in more pieces.

**Final decision:**
- Let's play the most forcing move: check with the bishop.

```

2025-06-22 00:59:29,875 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.35s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, Knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e8, pawn on a4, h5

**Position:**
- Black has two advanced pawns (a4, h5), but White has a full set of pieces and a safe king.
- White is fully developed and can castle kingside.
- Black's king is on e8, and Black has no pieces except pawns.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Castling kingside is safe and connects the rooks.
- White should activate pieces and prevent Black's pawns from becoming dangerous.
- White can also start pushing central pawns to restrict Black's king and create threats.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. e1g1 (castle kingside): Safe, connects rooks, king is safe.
2. c1g5 (develop bishop, pin h5 pawn): Not urgent, as Black has no pieces.
3. b1c3 (develop knight): Good, but castling is more urgent.
4. e4e5 (advance pawn): Not urgent, as king safety is more important.
5. h2h4 (stop h5-h4): Not urgent, as Black's pawn is not threatening yet.

**Best Move:**
- Castling kingside is the most logical, safe, and effective move. It brings the king to safety and prepares to activate the rook.

My move:

2025-06-22 00:59:38,349 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.27s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (b1), 6 pawns (a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)
- Black: King (e8), pawn (a3, h5)

**Position:**
- White is up a full rook and bishop for two pawns.
- Black's king is on e8, with no immediate threats.
- White's pieces are undeveloped, but Black has no counterplay.
- White's plan: Develop pieces, activate rook, push pawns, and convert material advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Develop knight:** b1c3, b1a3, b1d2
2. **Develop bishop:** c1h6, c1g5, c1f4, c1e3, c1d2
3. **Central pawn push:** e4e5
4. **Rook moves:** f1e1, f1d1
5. **Pawn moves:** h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4, b2b4

**Best plan:** 
- Develop pieces harmoniously.
- Control the center.
- Prevent any counterplay from Black's passed pawns.

**Immediate threats?**
- Black's only hope is to push a3-a2 and try to promote, but White can easily stop this.
- h5-h4 is not dangerous.

**Best move:**
- Develop the knight to c3, controlling the center and preparing to bring the rook to d1 or e1.
- b1c3 is the most natural, flexible, and strong move.

**Final move:**
```
b1c3
```

2025-06-22 00:59:48,788 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.48s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**White:** King on g1, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, Knight on c3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on f7, pawn on a3, h5

Material: White is up a piece (Bishop vs 2 pawns). Black's a3 pawn is advanced, but White's pieces are active and coordinated. White's king is safe, and Black's king is exposed.

**Candidate moves:**
- **c3b5**: Attacks the a3 pawn, threatening to win it.
- **c3d5**: Centralizes the knight, attacks the king, and covers e7/f6.
- **c1h6**: Threatens to exchange bishop for h5 pawn, but not urgent.
- **e4e5**: Gains space, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
- **b2a3**: Captures the a3 pawn, but allows ...h4 and Black's h-pawn runs.
- **g1h1**: King move, not urgent.
- **f1e1**: Rook move, not urgent.

**Critical lines:**
- **c3b5**: If ...a2, then White can play b2b3 and the pawn is stopped. If Black does nothing, White can play b2xa3 next.
- **c3d5**: Centralizes the knight, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.
- **b2a3**: If ...h4, White can play g2g3, but Black's h-pawn is not as dangerous as the a-pawn.

**Best plan:**  
- Stop Black's a-pawn, then collect it.
- Keep an eye on Black's h-pawn, but it's not as fast as the a-pawn.
- Centralize pieces and prepare to invade.

**Move calculation:**
- **c3b5** a2 (if Black pushes) b2b3 (stops pawn)  
  Now, White can play Rxa2 next move, and Black's a-pawn is gone.

- **b2a3** h4 (Black pushes h-pawn) g2g3 hxg3 hxg3 (now White has a passed h-pawn, but Black's king is far away and White is up a piece).

- **c3d5** doesn't threaten anything immediate.

**Conclusion:**  
**c3b5** is the most precise, attacking the a3 pawn and preparing to win it without allowing Black any counterplay.

My move:
```
c3b5

2025-06-22 00:59:59,154 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.65s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (b5), pawns (a2, b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)
- Black: King (f7), pawn (a3, h4)

**Positional factors:**
- White is up a piece (B+N vs 2 pawns).
- Black's king is exposed, White's king is safe.
- White's knight on b5 is very strong, controlling key squares.
- Black's a3 pawn is advanced, but White can block or capture it.
- White has a huge advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5c7**: Knight to c7, threatening discovered checks and attacking a8.
2. **b5a7**: Knight to a7, not very active.
3. **b5d6**: Knight to d6, attacking f7 and supporting e4-e5.
4. **b5d4**: Knight to d4, centralizing.
5. **b5c3**: Retreat, not needed.
6. **b5a3**: Captures the a3 pawn.
7. **c1h6**: Bishop to h6, threatening mate ideas.
8. **e4e5**: Pawn push, opening lines.
9. **h2h3**: Kicks the h4 pawn.
10. **g2g3**: Kicks the h4 pawn.

**Critical lines:**
- **b5a3**: Captures the dangerous a3 pawn, eliminates Black's only real counterplay. After this, White can focus on converting the material advantage.
- **b5d6+**: Check, but Black king can escape to g6 or e6.
- **c1h6**: Threatens mate, but Black can respond with ...Kg6.

**Best move:**
- **b5a3** is the most prudent. It removes Black's only dangerous pawn, keeps all threats, and maintains total control. No counterplay for Black.

Therefore, my move is:
```
b5a3

2025-06-22 01:00:05,875 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.69s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- White: King on g1, rook on a1, bishop on c1, knight on a3, pawns on b2, c2, e4, f2, g2, h2, f3, g3, h3.
- Black: King on f8, pawn on h4.

**Material:** White is up a full knight and has a huge material advantage.

**Threats:**
- Black's only threat is the h4 pawn, which is not dangerous yet.
- White can improve piece activity, centralize, and push for a win.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **e4e5**: Advance the pawn, restrict Black's king, and prepare e5-e6.
2. **a3b5**: Improve knight, but not urgent.
3. **c1h6**: Bishop to h6, threatens mate ideas, but Black can defend.
4. **h2h3**: Stop h3, but not urgent.
5. **c2c4**: Gain space, but not urgent.

**Best Plan:**
- Push e4-e5 to restrict Black's king and prepare to bring the rook or bishop to attack. The e5 pawn will also support a future e6, opening lines against the Black king.

**Tactics:**
- No immediate tactics for Black.
- White can slowly improve and win.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the e-pawn and restrict the Black king.

2025-06-22 01:00:12,797 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.24s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (a3), pawns (b2, c2, e5, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)
- Black: King (g8), pawn (h4)

**Position:**
- White is up a piece and has a passed pawn on e5.
- Black's king is on g8, with a pawn on h4. No other Black pieces.
- White's knight is on a3, not very active but can be repositioned.
- White's bishop is on c1, can be activated.
- White's rook is on a1, can be activated.
- White's king is safe on g1.
- White has a majority of pawns and can push for a win.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's only threat is the h4 pawn, but it is not dangerous yet.
- White can consider pushing the e-pawn, activating the bishop, or repositioning the knight.

**Candidate moves:**
1. e5e6: Push the passed pawn, threatening to promote.
2. c1g5: Activate the bishop, possibly targeting h4.
3. h2h3: Prevent h3-h2 ideas, but not urgent.
4. a3b5: Reposition the knight to a more active square.
5. f2f4: Prepare to support the e-pawn.
6. c2c4: Gain space and prepare to bring the knight to c2-d4.

**Analysis:**
- e5e6 is very strong, pushing the passed pawn and threatening to promote. Black cannot stop the pawn without material loss.
- c1g5 or c1h6 attacks the h4 pawn, but it's not urgent.
- a3b5 brings the knight closer to the center, but the pawn push is more urgent.
- h2h3 is slow.
- f2f4 supports e5, but e5 is not under attack.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the passed pawn and force Black to respond.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (a3), 6 pawns (a2, b2, c2, e6, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)
- Black: King (g7), 2 pawns (h4, g7)

**Position:**
- White has a passed pawn on e6, one square from queening.
- Black's king is on g7, unable to stop the e-pawn.
- White's knight is on a3, not very active but can be repositioned.
- White's rook and bishop are well placed.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6-e7**: Push the passed pawn. If Black does nothing, e8=Q next.
2. **c1-h6+**: Check, but Black just moves the king.
3. **a3-b5**: Reposition knight, but not urgent.
4. **Other pawn moves**: Not urgent.

**Critical analysis:**
- e7 is the most forcing move. Black cannot stop e8=Q except by giving up material.
- After e7, if Black plays ...Kf7, then e8=Q wins.
- If Black tries ...h3, White still queens.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the pawn:

2025-06-22 01:00:24,210 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.03s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen's pawn on e7 about to promote, knight on a3, rook on f1, bishop on c1, pawns on b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, king on f6.
- Black: King on f6, pawn on h4.

**Key points:**
- White's pawn on e7 is ready to promote.
- Black's king is on f6, unable to stop the promotion.
- No Black piece can stop e7-e8=Q.
- Black has only a pawn on h4, which is not dangerous.
- Promoting to a queen is the most logical and decisive move.

**Tactical check:**
- e7-e8=Q is safe: Black cannot capture the new queen, and White will have overwhelming material advantage.

**Alternative promotions:**
- Underpromotion (rook, bishop, knight) is unnecessary; queen is best.

**Conclusion:**
- Promote pawn to queen for immediate and decisive advantage.

Final move:
```
e7e8q
```

2025-06-22 01:00:28,225 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.33s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Material: White is up a queen and a knight for a rook (huge advantage).
- Black's king is on g7, with a pawn on h4. White's queen is on e8, knight on a3, rook on a1 and f1, bishop on c1, pawns on c2, b2, f2, g2, h2, and e8.
- White to move.

Immediate tactical opportunities:
- The Black king is on g7, with no immediate threats to White.
- White's queen on e8 can deliver a check on e5, h5, or g6.
- The move Qe5+ forces the king to f8 or h7, but both squares are covered by White's queen and rook.
- Qe5+ Kf8 is forced, then Qh8# is mate.

Let's check this line:
1. Qe5+ Kf8 (forced)
2. Qh8# (checkmate)

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e8e5
```

2025-06-22 01:00:34,968 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.17s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (e5), Knight (a3), Rooks (a1, f1), pawns (b2, c2, c3, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)
- Black: King (f7), pawn (h4)

**King safety:** Black's king is exposed on f7, White's king is safe.

**Threats:** 
- White can deliver checkmate or win material.
- The queen on e5 has access to many checks.
- Black's king has limited escape squares (e8, f8, g8, g7, g6, f6, e6, e7 are all unavailable).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e5h8+** (Queen to h8, check): Black's only legal move is ...f7g6, then Qh8g8# is mate.
2. **e5f6+** (Queen to f6, check): Black's only legal move is ...f7g8, then Qf6g7# is mate.
3. **e5g7+** (Queen to g7, check): Black's only legal move is ...f7g7, then Qe5g5+ picks up the king.
4. Other queen moves are not checks or do not threaten mate.

Let's check the lines:

- **e5h8+ f7g6 e5g8#** is checkmate.
- **e5f6+ f7g8 e5g7#** is checkmate.

Both moves lead to forced mate in two. Let's double-check for any faster mate or more forcing move.

- **e5h8+** is the most direct, as after ...Kg6, Qg8# is mate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e5h8
```

2025-06-22 01:00:41,090 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.24s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: Queen on h8, Knight on a3, pawns on b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, King on g1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c1, pawns on c2, b2, f2, g2, h2, and h3.
- Black: King on f7, pawn on h3.

**Material:**
- White is up a queen, two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and several pawns vs. just a king and a pawn for Black.

**Threats:**
- White can checkmate in one move.

**Candidate moves:**
- Qg8# (h8g8): Queen moves to g8, checkmate. The Black king on f7 cannot escape.
- Qf8# (h8f8): Queen moves to f8, checkmate. The Black king on f7 cannot escape.

Let's check both:

1. **h8g8**: Queen to g8. Black king on f7 is boxed in by its own pawn on h3, White's pawns and pieces, and cannot escape to any square. This is checkmate.
2. **h8f8**: Queen to f8. Same result, checkmate.

Both are mate in one, but h8g8 is the most direct.

**Final move:**
```
h8g8
```

2025-06-22 01:00:47,924 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.92s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on f1, Queen on g8, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, Knight on a3, pawns on b2, c2, c3, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on f6, pawn on h3

**Material:** White is up a queen, rook, bishop, and knight for a king and pawn. Black has only the king and a pawn on h3.

**Threats:**
- Black's only threat is to push the h-pawn, but it's not dangerous yet.
- White can try to checkmate or win the h3 pawn.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- White's queen on g8 can check on g5, g6, g7, or move to threaten mate.
- The king is on f6, so checks on g5, g7, g6, e6, etc., are possible.
- The queen can also capture h3, but it's not currently possible.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. Qg8g5+ (check)
2. Qg8h8 (threatening Qh6#)
3. Qg8f8+ (check)
4. Qg8g7 (check)
5. Qg8g6 (check)
6. Qg8e6 (check)
7. Qg8g4 (check)
8. Qg8g3 (check)
9. Develop pieces or push pawns (not urgent)

**Checkmate Threats:**
- If the king moves to f7, Qg7# is mate.
- If the king moves to e6, Qg6# is mate.
- If the king moves to g5, Qg5# is mate.

**Let's check Qg8g7+:**
- ...Kf5: Qg5#
- ...Ke6: Qg6#
- ...Ke7: Qg7#
- ...Kf7: Qg7#
- ...Ke5: Qg5#
- ...Kf6: repeats

But the king is already on f6, so Qg7+ is not a check.

**Let's check Qg8g5+:**
- ...Ke6: Qg6#
- ...Kf7: Qg7#
- ...Kf5: Qg5#
- ...Ke5: Qg5#

**So Qg5+ seems to force mate in one after any king move.**

**Final move:**
```
g8g5
```

2025-06-22 01:00:58,644 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.63s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/4k3/6Q1/8/N6p/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 4 48

**White:** King on g1, Queen on g5, Rook on a1 and f1, Bishop on c1, Knight on a3, pawns on b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, h3  
**Black:** King on e6, pawn on h3

**Black's king is exposed in the center. White's queen is very active, and White has a huge material advantage.**

Let's look for a forced mate or the most forcing continuation.

**Candidate moves:**
- g5g8+ (Queen check on the back rank)
- g5g7+ (Queen check)
- g5e7+ (Queen check)
- g5h6+ (Queen check)
- g5g6+ (Queen check)
- g5f6+ (Queen check)
- g5h5+ (Queen check)
- g5f5+ (Queen check)
- g5e5+ (Queen check)
- g5d5+ (Queen check)

Let's check the most forcing checks first.

### 1. g5g8+
- King can only go to d7 or f7 (but f7 is covered by the queen).
- If Ke7, then Qg7+ wins the queen.
- If Kd7, then Qg7+ is mate.

But let's check the lines:

#### 1. g5g8+
- Ke7 (only move)
- Qg7+ (forces Kd6)
- Nc4+ (discovered check, king must move)
- ...and so on.

But let's check for mate in one:

### 2. g5g7+
- King can only go to d6 or f5 (but f5 is covered by the queen).
- If Kd6, then Nc4+ is a discovered check.

### 3. g5e7+
- King can only go to f5 or d5.
- If Kf5, then Qf7# is mate.
- If Kd5, then Qd7# is mate.

Wait, let's check this carefully:

#### 3. g5e7+
- Ke6-d5 (only move)
- Qd7# (checkmate)

So, **g5e7+** forces the king to d5, and then Qd7# is mate.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
g5e7
```

2025-06-22 01:01:04,743 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.62s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (a3), 6 pawns (b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, f3), King (g1)
- Black: King (e7), pawn (h3)

**Position:**
- Black's king is centralized but has no immediate threats.
- Black's pawn on h3 is advanced, but White can easily stop it.
- White has a large material advantage (Rook, Bishop, Knight vs. lone King and pawn).
- White's pieces are not yet fully coordinated, but there is no danger.

**Plan:**
- Stop Black's h-pawn from advancing.
- Activate pieces to coordinate for checkmate.
- Consider capturing the h3 pawn with g2xh3, but first check if there is a more forcing move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g2xh3: Immediately captures the h3 pawn, removing Black's only hope for counterplay.
2. c1g5+: Check, but Black's king can escape to f7 or e6.
3. a3b5: Activates the knight, but not urgent.
4. f1e1: Centralizes the rook, but not urgent.
5. g2g3: Prepares to capture h3, but less direct than g2xh3.

**Tactical check:**
- After g2xh3, Black has no threats, and White can proceed to coordinate for mate.
- No immediate checkmate available, but removing the h3 pawn is the most urgent.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the h3 pawn, eliminating Black's only counterplay and simplifying the win.

```

2025-06-22 01:01:11,035 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.03s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (a3), pawns (b2, c2, f2, h3, h2, f2, p1), King (g1)  
Black: King (f8)

White is up a full rook, bishop, and knight, with many pawns. Black has only the king. This is a trivially won position for White, but we must avoid stalemate and play efficiently.

**Immediate plan:**  
- Activate pieces, especially the rook and bishop, to cut off the Black king and prepare to shepherd it to a corner for checkmate.
- Avoid stalemating the Black king by leaving it at least one legal move at all times until the final mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g1g2**: King centralization, but not urgent.
2. **f1e1**: Rook to e1, preparing to swing to the e-file.
3. **c1h6**: Bishop to h6, not very useful.
4. **a3b5**: Knight to b5, heading to d6 or c7 to help control escape squares.
5. **a1b1**: Rook to b1, preparing to swing to the 7th or 8th rank.
6. **f2f3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
7. **h3h4**: Pawn move, not urgent.

**Best plan:**  
- The most effective way to win is to bring the rook to the 7th or 8th rank, cut off the king, and use the bishop and knight to control escape squares.
- The knight can go to c4 or b5, but the rook is more powerful here.

**Best move:**  
**a1b1** (Rook to b1)  
This prepares to bring the rook to b8 or b7, cutting off the Black king and making progress toward mate. It also keeps all options open and avoids stalemate.

Final move:
```
a1b1

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Rook (b1), Rook (f1), Bishop (c1), Knight (a3), pawns (b2, c2, f2, h3, h2, f3, h4)  
Black: King (g7)

**Position:**  
- Black has only the king left, which is on g7.
- White has overwhelming material and a completely winning position.
- The only thing to be careful about is not stalemating the Black king.

**Short-term tactics:**  
- No immediate checkmate, but White can improve the position.
- The Black king is on the edge, so we can try to restrict its movement further.

**Long-term strategy:**  
- Bring the king closer, coordinate the rooks and bishop to box in the Black king, and deliver mate.
- Avoid stalemate by ensuring the Black king always has at least one square.

**Candidate moves:**  
- Rook moves: g1-g2, g1-h1 (activate rook along the rank)
- Bishop moves: c1-h6, c1-g5, c1-f4, c1-e3, c1-d2 (activate bishop to control more squares)
- Knight moves: a3-b5, a3-c4 (bring knight closer to the action)
- Pawn moves: h3-h4, f2-f3, c2-c3, b2-b3, f2-f4, c2-c4, b2-b4 (advance pawns to restrict king or prepare to bring king in)

**Best plan:**  
- Let's activate the bishop to control more squares and help box in the king.
- c1-h6 is a strong move, as it cuts off the king from the h-file and controls key squares.

**Double-check for stalemate:**  
- After c1-h6, Black's king still has f7, h7, h6, and f6 squares available, so no stalemate.

**Final move:**
```
c1h6
```

2025-06-22 01:01:26,097 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.83s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Rook (b1), Rook (f1), Bishop (h6), Knight (a3), pawns (b2, c2, f2, h3, h2, f3, c3, b3)  
Black: King (g6)

**King Safety:**  
Black's king is on g6, with no pawns or pieces nearby for defense. White's pieces are active and can coordinate for a checkmate.

**Immediate Threats:**  
- The bishop on h6 controls key diagonals.
- The rook on f1 can swing to the g-file.
- The knight can jump to b5 or c4.
- The rook on b1 can swing to the g-file or h-file.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **h6f8** (Bishop to f8, threatening mate ideas with Rook to g1)
2. **h6g7** (Bishop to g7, controlling h8 and f6)
3. **h6g5+** (Bishop to g5+, check, but Black's king can move to f5 or h5)
4. **g1g2** (Preparing to double rooks on the g-file)
5. **b1b3** (Preparing to bring the rook to g3 for mate)
6. **h3h4** (Preparing h4-h5 for mate, but slow)

**Let's check the forcing lines:**

- **h6g5+**: Black's king can go to f5 or h5, but after Kf5, White can play f2-f4, but it's not immediate mate.
- **h6f8**: Prepares Rg1, but not a direct threat.
- **g1g2**: Prepares doubling on the g-file, but not immediate.
- **b1b3**: Prepares Rg3#, but Black can play ...Kf5.

**What about h6g7?**
- Controls h8 and f6, but doesn't threaten mate.

**What about Rook lift?**
- b1b3, then Rg3 is mate if Black's king stays on g6.

**Check for immediate mate:**
- h6g5+ Kf5 (only move), then f2-f4, but Black can play exf4 (if pawn on e5), but there is no pawn.
- h6g5+ Kh5, then h3h4, but Black can play Kg4.

**Best plan:**
- Prepare Rg3# with b1b3.

Let's check if Black can escape after b1b3:
- If Black plays ...Kf5, then Rf3+ Kg5, h4+ Kxh4, Rf4+ Kg5, h4+ (no, not immediate mate).
- If Black does nothing, Rg3# is mate.

But after b1b3, Black's king can go to f5.

Alternatively, h6g5+ Kf5, Rb5+ Ke4, f3+ Kd4, Be3+ Kc4, Rc5+ Kb4, Rb1+ Ka4, Rc4+ Ka5, Bd2#

But that's a long line.

**Let's try h6g5+ Kf5, Rb5+ Ke4, f3+ Kd4, Be3+ Kc4, Rc5+ Kb4, Rb1+ Ka4, Rc4+ Ka5, Bd2#**

This is a forced mate in several moves.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h6g5
```

2025-06-22 01:01:32,927 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.82s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Rook (f1), Bishop (g5), Knight (a3), pawns (b2, c2, f2, h3, h2, f2, p on h4), King (g1)
- Black: King (g7)

**Black has only the king, White has overwhelming material.**

**Immediate threats:**
- No immediate threats from Black.
- White can try to force mate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5f6+**: King is forced to move to h7 or h6.
2. **g5h6+**: King is forced to h6.
3. **g5e7**: Not a check, but attacks nothing.
4. **g5d8**: Not a check, but attacks nothing.
5. **a3b5**: Develops knight, but not urgent.
6. **g1g2**: King move, not urgent.

**Checkmate patterns:**
- The Black king is on g7, with no pawns to shield it.
- If White can bring the rook to the 7th rank (f7 or b7), with support, mate is possible.
- The bishop can cut off escape squares.

**Let's calculate g5f6+:**
- 1. Bg5-f6+ Kg7-h7 (forced)
- Then, Rb1-b8 (threatening Rh8#)
- Black has no moves, so after Rb8, next move is Rh8# (with support from bishop on f6).

Alternatively, after 1. Bg5-f6+ Kg7-h6, then Rb8 is still strong.

**Let's check g5h6+:**
- 1. Bg5-h6+ Kg7-h6 (forced)
- Then, Rb1-b8, threatening Rh8#.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- After 1. Bg5-f6+ Kg7-h7 2. Rb1-b8, Black has no moves to prevent Rh8#.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- 1. Bg5-f6+ Kg7-h7 2. Rb1-b8 Rh8# is unstoppable.

**Conclusion:** 
The move 1. Bg5-f6+ is the most forcing, driving the king to the edge and setting up a swift mate.

My move:
```
g5f6

2025-06-22 01:01:39,864 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.84s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Rook (b1), Knight (a3), 6 pawns (b2, c2, f2, f3, h2, h4), King (g1)  
Black: King (f6)

**Position:**  
- White is up a rook and a knight, with a healthy pawn structure.
- Black has only the king.
- White's king is safe, and there are no immediate threats.
- The only thing to avoid is stalemate.

**Objective:**  
- Avoid stalemate (i.e., don't remove all Black's moves).
- Convert the advantage to a win, ideally by activating the king and pushing pawns, but not rushing.

**Candidate moves:**  
- Improve king: g1-g2 (centralizing, but not urgent)
- Improve rook: b1-d1, b1-e1, b1-c1 (cutting off Black's king)
- Improve knight: a3-b5, a3-c4 (closer to the action)
- Push pawns: h3-h4, f2-f3, c2-c3, b2-b3, etc.

**Best plan:**  
- Cut off Black's king with the rook, then bring the king up and push pawns.
- Rook to d1 or e1 is strong, as it restricts Black's king.

**Check for stalemate:**  
- Black's king is on f6, with e6, e5, f5, g5, g6, g7, f7, e7 all empty.
- So, no risk of stalemate.

**Best move:**  
- Rook to d1: cuts off the king from the d-file, and prepares to bring the king up.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b1d1
```

2025-06-22 01:01:45,727 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (d1), Knight (a3), pawns (b2, c2, f2, h3, h2, f3, g1, g2), King (g1)
- Black: King (g7)

**Position:**
- White is up a rook and a knight, with many pawns. Black has only the king.
- No immediate threats from Black.
- White's plan: activate pieces, push pawns, and restrict the Black king, aiming for checkmate or promotion.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d1d7**: Rook to 7th rank, cutting off the Black king from the 7th and 8th ranks. This is a classic technique in king and rook vs king endings.
2. **d1d8**: Rook to 8th rank, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
3. **a3b5**: Knight closer to the center, but not as urgent as activating the rook.
4. **h3h4**: Pawn push, but not urgent.
5. **f2f4**: Pawn push, but not urgent.
6. **g1g2**: King move, but not urgent.

**Best move:**
- **d1d7** is the most effective. It restricts the Black king to the 7th and 8th ranks, making it easier to coordinate a checkmate or force a pawn promotion.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d1d7

- White has two rooks (d7, f1), knight (a3), pawns (b2, c2, f2, h3, h2, g2), king (g1).

**Immediate threats and goals:**
- Black has only a king, so White's goal is to checkmate as quickly as possible.
- The Black king is on f8, so we want to cut off escape squares and coordinate our pieces.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d7d8: Rook to d8, check. Black must play Kf7 or Kg7, but both are covered by the rook on f1 and the knight on a3 (which can come in later).
2. d7f7: Rook to f7, threatening mate on f8.
3. d7h7: Rook to h7, not immediately threatening.
4. f1d1: Doubling rooks on the d-file.
5. a3c4: Knight closer to the action.

But the most forcing move is d7d8+, which forces the Black king to e7 or g7, but both are covered. Let's check:

- 1. Rd8+ Ke7 (illegal, f8 is the only square)
- 1. Rd8+ Kf7 (illegal, f8 is occupied)
- 1. Rd8+ Kg7 (illegal, g7 is covered by the rook on d7)
- 1. Rd8+ Ke8 (illegal, d8 is occupied)
- 1. Rd8+ Kg8 (illegal, g8 is covered by the rook on f1)

Wait, the Black king is on f8, so 1. Rd8+ forces Kg7, but g7 is covered by the rook on d7. So, the only legal move is Kg8, but that's not possible.

Actually, after 1. Rd8+, the only move is Kg7, but g7 is covered. So, 1. Rd8# is checkmate.

**Conclusion:** The move is checkmate.

2025-06-22 01:02:24,933 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.56s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3R4/4k3/8/8/8/N6P/PPP2P1P/5RK1 w - - 6 57  
White to move.

**Material:**  
- White: 2 rooks, knight, 6 pawns  
- Black: king only

**Goal:** Checkmate as quickly as possible, no stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**  
- The Black king is on e7, and White's rook is on d8.  
- Rook moves along the 8th rank (d8-h8, d8-g8, etc.) do not check.  
- Rook moves along the d-file (d8-d7, d8-d6, etc.) do not check.  
- No immediate mate with knight or pawns.

**Check for forced mate:**  
- Rook to e8 (d8e8) checks the king.  
- After d8e8+, Black's only move is king to f6 or d6 (since f8, d8, e6 are not available).  
- Let's check:  
  - d8e8+ Ke6 (only move, as f7, d7, e6 are not available)  
  - Then White can bring the other rook or knight, but let's see if there is a faster mate.

But let's check if there is a mate in one:  
- No rook move gives mate in one.  
- No knight move gives mate in one.  
- No pawn move gives mate in one.

So, the best move is to check with the rook and drive the king to the edge.

**Best move:**  
```
d8e8
```

2025-06-22 01:02:31,228 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.30s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, Rooks on e8 and f1, Knight on a3, pawns on b2, c2, f2, h2, h3, f2, g2, and h2.
- Black: King on f7.

**Material:** White is up a full rook and knight, with many pawns. Black has only a king.

**Objective:** Convert this overwhelming advantage to a win as efficiently and safely as possible. Avoid stalemate traps.

**Immediate checks:**
- e8h8, e8g8, e8f8: All rook moves along the 8th rank, but Black king is on f7, so none are checks.
- e8e7: Rook to e7, attacks the king, but not a check.
- e8e6, e8e5, etc.: No checks.

**Stalemate check:** Black king is on f7, has squares e7, g7, f6, e6, g6, but all are covered by White's pieces or pawns, except f7 itself. However, after any rook move that doesn't check, Black still has moves.

**Best plan:** Bring the king closer, coordinate rooks, and avoid stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. e8e7: Rook to e7, restricts Black king further.
2. a3b5: Bring knight closer to center.
3. f1e1: Double rooks on the e-file.
4. h3h4: Start pushing pawns.
5. f2f3: Give king luft, but not urgent.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Not immediately, but with two rooks and a knight, mate is inevitable.

**Best move:** Let's play e8e7, bringing the rook to the 7th rank, cutting off the Black king and preparing to double rooks or bring the king up.

```
e8e7

2025-06-22 01:02:49,815 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.71s):
Let's analyze the position step by step:

**Material:**  
- White: 2 rooks, knight, 6 pawns  
- Black: king only

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black's king is on g6, cut off from the 7th rank by the rook on e7.
- White's rook on e7 can deliver a check on g7 or h7.
- White's other rook is on f1, ready to join the attack.
- White's knight on a3 is far from the action, but not needed for mate.

**Candidate moves:**  
- e7g7+ (Rook check)
- e7h7+ (Rook check)
- e7e8 (retreat rook)
- e7f7 (retreat rook)
- e7e6 (retreat rook)
- f1e1 (move rook)
- pawn moves, knight moves, king moves (not relevant for immediate mate)

**Checkmate patterns:**  
- If Rg7+, Black's king can only go to h6.
- If Rh7, Black's king can only go to g5.
- Let's check both:

1. **e7g7+**  
   - Black's only move: Kh6  
   - Then, White can play Rg1 (threatening mate on h8), but it's not immediate.

2. **e7h7+**  
   - Black's only move: Kg5  
   - Then, White can play f4+ (but pawn is on f2, so not possible yet), or Rhf7, but not immediate mate.

3. **e7e8**  
   - Not a check, no threat.

4. **e7f7**  
   - Not a check, no threat.

**Is there a forced mate?**

Let's try **e7g7+**:

- 1. Rg7+ Kh6  
- 2. Rg1 (preparing Rh8#)  
- Black has no way to stop Rh8# (since the king is on h6, and the only escape square is g5, but that's covered by the rook on g7).

So, **e7g7+** is the strongest move, leading to a forced mate.

**Final move:**
```
e7g7
```

2025-06-22 01:03:08,194 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.03s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6R1/8/7k/8/N6P/PPP2P1P/5RK1 w - - 12 60  
White to move.

**Material:**  
White: 2 rooks, knight, 6 pawns  
Black: King only

**Black's king is on h5. White's rook is on g7, supported by the f1 rook. White's knight is on a3.**

**Goal:** Checkmate as quickly as possible.

**Candidate moves:**
- g7g8: Rook to g8, not a check.
- g7h7: Rook to h7, check.
- h3h4: Pawn to h4, check.

Let's look at **g7h7+**:
- Black king is forced to g5 (the only legal move).

After g7h7+ Kg5, White can play Rg2 (preparing h4#), but let's see if there's anything faster.

What about **h3h4+**?
- Black king can go to h6 or h4.
- If Kh4, White has Rh7#.
- If Kg4, White can play f3+ and then mate with Rg2.

But **g7h7+** is more forcing.

Let's check the mate sequence:

1. Rg7-h7+ Kg5
2. h3-h4+ Kf4 (if Kg4, then f3#)
3. h4-h5 (threatening h5-h6#)
But Black can only move the king.

Alternatively, after 1. Rg7-h7+ Kg5, 2. h3-h4+ Kf4, 3. h4-h5, the king is running away.

But let's check **h3h4+** first:

1. h3-h4+ Kh4 (forced)
2. Rg7-h7# (checkmate)

This is mate in two.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h3h4
```

2025-06-22 01:03:14,172 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.48s):
Let's analyze the position:

White:
- King on g1
- Rook on f1 and g7
- Knight on a3
- Pawns on b2, c2, f2, h2, and possibly more advanced pawns (but none on the 7th/8th rank)
- Black king on h4

Black:
- King on h4
- No other pieces

White to move.

Immediate tactical considerations:
- Black's king is on h4, very exposed.
- White has a rook on g7, which can deliver check on g8.
- White has another rook on f1, which can swing to the h-file or support other checks.
- White's knight on a3 is far from the action, but not needed for immediate mate.
- White's pawns are not relevant for immediate tactics.

Candidate moves:
1. g7g8: Rook to g8, check. Black king can only go to h5.
2. g7h7: Rook to h7, check. Black king can go to g4 or g5.
3. g7g6: Rook to g6, check. Black king can only go to h5.
4. f1e1: Rook to e1, preparing Re4# if king is on h4.
5. g1g2: King move, not urgent.

Let's check g7g8+:
- 1. Rg8 Kh5 (only move)
- Then, Rg5# is checkmate.

But after 1. Rg8 Kh5, is Rg5 legal? Yes, because the rook on g7 moves to g8, then to g5, and the king is on h5.

But let's check if Rg8 is the fastest mate.

Alternatively, g7h7+:
- 1. Rh7+ Kg4 (only move)
- 2. f3+ Kf4 (only move)
- 3. Rh4+ Kf3 (only move)
- 4. Re1 (threatening Re3#), but this is slower.

So, the fastest mate is:
1. Rg8 Kh5
2. Rg5#

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g7g8
```

2025-06-22 01:03:20,128 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.47s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, Rooks on f1 and g8, Knight on a3, pawns on b2, c2, f2, h2, h3.
- Black: King on h5.

**Material:** White is up a rook and a knight; Black has only the king.

**Threats:** White can checkmate Black with the right rook maneuver. The Black king is on h5, so a back-rank mate is possible.

**Candidate Moves:**
- g8h8: Rook to h8, threatening mate on h7 if the king moves.
- g8g7: Rook to g7, controlling the 7th rank.
- g8g6: Rook to g6, checking the king.
- a3b5: Knight to b5, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
- h2h3: Pawn move, not urgent.

**Check for Immediate Mate:**
- g8g6+ forces the king to h4 (since h6 is covered by the rook, and h5 is occupied).
- After g8g6+, if Kh4, then Rg4# is mate (but the rook is on f1, so that's not possible in one move).
- g8h8 doesn't check, but prepares Rh8# if the king moves to h4.

**Best Move:**
- g8g6+ is a check, and after Kh4, White can bring the other rook to g4 for mate, but it takes a tempo.
- Alternatively, g8g5+ is also a check, but the king can go to h6 or h4.
- Let's check g8g4+: If the king goes to h4, then Rg4# is mate, but the rook is not on g4 yet.

**Conclusion:**
The fastest way to mate is to check with the rook and drive the king to the edge, then bring the other rook to g4 for mate.

So, the best move is:
```
g8g6
```

2025-06-22 01:03:25,259 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.30s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, Rook on f1, Knight on a3, pawns on b2, c2, f2, h2, and h4.
- Black: King on g6.

**Material:** White is up a rook and a knight for nothing (Black has only the king). This is a trivially won position for White, but let's focus on the most efficient way to win and avoid stalemates.

**Immediate goals:**
- Avoid stalemating the Black king.
- Activate the rook and knight to restrict the Black king.
- Advance pawns only if it helps the plan.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g1g2**: King centralization, but not urgent.
2. **f1d1**: Rook to open file, but not necessary.
3. **a3c4**: Knight closer to the center, controls more squares.
4. **h2h4**: Pawn move, but not urgent.
5. **f2f3**: King escape square, but not urgent.

**Best plan:** 
- Bring the knight closer to the action (center), so it can help box in the Black king.
- The rook is already well placed to cut off the Black king from the f-file.
- Advancing pawns is not urgent and could risk stalemate if not careful.

**Best move:** 
- **a3c4**: Knight to c4, heading towards e5 or d6, which will help box in the Black king and assist in checkmating.

So, my move is:
```
a3c4
```

2025-06-22 01:03:34,906 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.72s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King (g1), Rook (f1), Knight (c4), 6 pawns (a2, b2, c2, f2, h2, h3)  
Black: King (f7)  

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black has only the king left.  
- White has a rook and knight, and a healthy pawn structure.  
- The Black king is on f7, not in immediate danger of a back rank mate, but White can try to cut off the king and coordinate rook and knight for a checkmate.

**Candidate moves:**  
- Rook moves: f1-fd1, f1-e1, f1-c1, etc. (activate rook, cut king)
- Knight moves: c4-d6, c4-b6, c4-e5, etc. (bring knight closer to king)
- King moves: g1-g2, g1-h1 (not urgent)
- Pawn moves: not urgent, but could be played to gain space or prepare for king activation

**Best plan:**  
- Cut off the Black king with the rook, ideally on the d-file or e-file.
- Bring the knight closer to the king to help with the mating net.
- Advance the king if needed.

**Analyzing rook moves:**  
- f1-d1: Cuts off the king from the d-file, but Black king is already on f7.
- f1-e1: Cuts off the king from the e-file, but not as effective as d1.
- f1-fd1 is more active than f1-e1.

**Analyzing knight moves:**  
- c4-d6: Attacks e8, f7, f5, b7, b5, e4, but doesn't check the king.
- c4-e5: Attacks f7, d7, d3, b6, b4, g4, but doesn't check the king.
- c4-b6: Attacks d7, d5, a8, a4, but not very active.
- c4-e3: Retreats, not active.

**Knight to d6 seems the most active, as it brings the knight closer to the king and controls key squares.**

**But let's check if there's a forced mate or a way to restrict the king further.**

If 1. Nc4-d6+ (check), Black must move the king:
- 1... Kf8 (only move)
- Then Rook can swing to e1 or d1 to cut off the king further.

Alternatively, play Rd1 first to cut off the king from the d-file, but the king is not threatening to escape.

**Let's check the move Nc4-d6+:**
- 1. Nc4-d6+ Kf8 (only move)
- Now, Rook can come to e1, and the king is cut off.

Alternatively, after Nc4-d6+, the king is forced to the back rank, making it easier to coordinate rook and knight for mate.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
c4d6
```

- d6e4: Knight to e4, no check, covers f6, g3, c3, c5.
- g1g2: King move, not urgent.
- f1d1, f1e1, etc.: Rook moves, could help cut off the king.

The Black king is on f6, and can move to e6, e7, f7, g7, g6, g5, f5, e5 (but many are covered by the knight).

Let's check for stalemate: Black king has squares to move, so no risk right now.

Best plan: Cut off the Black king and bring our king closer, but first, let's see if we can restrict the Black king further.

The move f1e1 (rook to e1) doesn't do much.  
The move f1d1 (rook to d1) could help cut off the king from the queenside, but the king is already on the kingside.

The move d6e4 (knight to e4) attacks f6 and covers more squares, but doesn't restrict the king much.

The move d6f5 (knight to f5) attacks e7, g7, h6, d4. If Black king moves to g5, then rook can come to f4 with check.

Alternatively, let's consider advancing pawns to bring the king in.

But the most direct way is to use the knight to restrict the king and bring the rook to cut off files.

Let's try d6e4: Knight to e4. This covers f6, g3, c3, c5. The king is still not stalemated and can move.

Alternatively, d6f5: Knight to f5. If Kxf5, illegal. If Kg5, then Rook f4+.

But let's check if d6e8 is better: Knight to e8. The king can move to g5, e6, e7.

Alternatively, let's try to bring the rook to the 6th rank: f1d1, then Rd6+.

But first, let's play a knight move that restricts the king.

After careful consideration, the move d6f5 is best. It restricts the king and prepares to bring the rook to f4 for a check if the king moves to g5.

So, my move is:
```
d6f5
```

2025-06-22 01:04:00,516 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 15.47s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King on g1, Rook on f1, Knight on f5, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, h2  
- Black: King on g6

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black's king is cut off from the f-file and is on the edge of the board.
- White's knight is very active and close to the Black king.
- White's rook is well placed for cutting off the king.
- White has a clear material advantage and can play for a win.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f5e7**: Knight moves closer to the king, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
2. **f5g7**: Knight check, but the king can move to h7 or f7.
3. **f5h4**: Knight moves away, not useful.
4. **f5d6**: Retreat, not useful.
5. **f5g3**: Retreat, not useful.
6. **f5e3**: Retreat, not useful.
7. **g1g2**: King move, not urgent.
8. **h2h3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
9. **f2f3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
10. **c2c3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
11. **Rook moves**: Not urgent.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The Black king is on g6. If we play **Ne7+**, the king is forced to h7 or f7.
- If **Kg7**, then Nf5+ repeats.
- If **Kf7**, then Nf5+ repeats.
- If **Kh7**, then the king is pushed to the edge.

But let's check **f5e7+**:
- 1. Ne7+ Kh7 (forced)
- 2. Rf7+ Kh6 (forced)
- 3. h4 (threatening Nf5#)

But let's see if there's a more direct way.

**Try f5g7+:**
- 1. Ng7 Kg7 (only move)
- 2. Rf7+ Kg8 (forced)
- 3. Rf6 (threatening Ne6#)

But the king can escape.

**Try f5h4:**
- Not useful.

**Try f5d4:**

**Try improving king position:**
- Not urgent.

**Try pushing pawns:**

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on g1, Rook on f1, Knight on e7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, h2
- Black: King on g5

**White to move.**

**Black's king is exposed on g5. White has a rook and knight, and Black has no pieces except the king.**

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7-g8** (Knight to g8): This threatens f4+ and covers h6, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.
2. **e7-c8** (Knight to c8): Not relevant.
3. **e7-g6** (Knight to g6): This is a check.
4. **e7-c6** (Knight to c6): Not relevant.
5. **e7-f5** (Knight to f5): This is a check.
6. **e7-d5** (Knight to d5): Not relevant.
7. **f1-f4** (Rook to f4): This is a check.
8. **Other rook moves:** Not checks.
9. **Pawn moves:** Not urgent.

**Let's check the checks:**

- **e7-g6 (Ng6+):** Black king can only go to h5 or f5.
    - 1. Ng6+ Kf5 (or Kh5)
    - After Kf5, White can play Ne7-d5, forking king and rook square, but no rook to fork. Not decisive.
    - After Kh5, White can play Nf4+ (after moving the rook), but not immediate mate.

- **e7-f5 (Nf5+):** Black king can only go to f4 or h5.
    - 1. Nf5+ Kf4
    - 2. Nf5+ Kh5

- **f1-f4 (Rf4+):** Black king can only go to h5.
    - 1. Rf4+ Kh5
    - Then Nf5 (threatening mate on h4), but not immediate mate.

**Let's check for forced mate:**

- 1. Rf4+ Kh5
- 2. Ng7+ Kg5 (only move)
- 3. Ne6+ Kg6
- 4. h4 (threatening h5#)
- But Black can escape via h6.

Alternatively, let's try:

- 1. Nf5+ Kf4 (only move)
- 2. Ne3 (threatening Rf5#)
- But Black can play Kf3.

Alternatively, let's try:

- 1. Ng6 Kf5 (or Kh5)
- If Kf5, then Ne7-d5+ (fork), but not decisive.

**Best move:**

Among all, **Rf4+** looks the most promising, as it forces the king to the edge and keeps up the pressure.

**Final move:**
```
f1f4
```

2025-06-22 01:04:15,981 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.37s):
Thank you for pointing out the error and providing the list of legal moves.

Let's re-examine the position and the legal moves:

**White:**
- King on g1
- Rook on f1
- Knight on e7
- Pawns: a2, b2, c2, f2, h2

**Black:**
- King on g5

**Legal moves:**
e7g8, e7c8, e7g6, e7c6, e7f5, e7d5, g1g2, g1h1, f1e1, f1d1, f1c1, f1b1, f1a1, h2h3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, f2f4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4

**Let's analyze the checks:**
- e7g6 (Ng6+): Knight to g6 gives check.
- e7f5 (Nf5+): Knight to f5 gives check.

Let's see what happens after each:

**1. e7g6 (Ng6+):**
- Black's king can go to h5 or f5.

If 1...Kh5:
- White can play Nf4+ (but not immediately, as the knight is on g6).
- White can play h4, threatening Nf4#.

If 1...Kf5:
- White can play Ne7-d5+ (fork), but not decisive.

**2. e7f5 (Nf5+):**
- Black's king can go to f4 or h5.

If 1...Kf4:
- White can play Ne3 (threatening Rf5#), but Black can escape.

If 1...Kh5:
- White can play Ng7+ (fork), but not decisive.

**Are there any other forcing moves?**
- No rook checks are available.

**Should we improve our position?**
- Advancing pawns doesn't seem urgent.

**Is there a way to restrict the Black king?**
- h2-h4 is interesting, but not forcing.

**Between Ng6+ and Nf5+, which is better?**
- Ng6+ keeps the king on the edge and may allow for a mating net with h4-h5.

**Let's try:**
1. Ng6+ Kh5
2. h4 (threatening Nf4#)
If Black plays Kg4, then Ne5# is mate.

If Black plays Kg6, then h5+ wins.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e7g6
```

2025-06-22 01:04:21,364 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.11s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, Rook on f1, Knight on g6, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, h2
- Black: King on g4

**Material:** White is up a rook and a knight, with plenty of pawns. Black has only the king.

**Objective:** With such a material advantage, the goal is to checkmate Black efficiently, while avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate Candidate Moves:**
- The Black king is on g4, so we must avoid pushing pawns that would stalemate or allow Black to escape.
- The knight on g6 controls important squares (e5, f4, h4, e7, f8, h8).
- The rook on f1 can cut off the king.
- The king on g1 is far, but not needed for immediate mate.

**Check for Immediate Mate:**
- g6e5+ is a check. If Kg5, then Nf3# is mate.
- g6h4+ is a check. If Kf3, then Rh1# is mate.
- g6f4+ is a check. If Kf3, then Nh4# is mate.

Let's analyze g6e5+:
- 1. Ng6-e5+ Kg5 (only move)
- 2. Nf3# (knight mate)

So, this is a forced mate in two.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g6e5
```

2025-06-22 01:04:27,832 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.08s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, Rook on f1, Knight on e5, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, h2
- Black: King on h4

**Material:** White is up a rook and knight, and has a completely winning position. Black has only the king left.

**Immediate threats:** There are no immediate threats from Black. White can play for checkmate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Knight checks: e5f7, e5d7, e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3
- Rook moves: f1f2 (not legal), f1e1, etc.
- King moves: g1g2, g1h1
- Pawn moves: h2h3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, f2f4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4

**Checkmate threats:** Let's see if we can force mate quickly.

- If Nf3+, Black's only move is Kh3.
- If Nf7, Kh3.
- If Nf7, Kh3, then f3 (preparing Rf2#), but Black can play ...g4 (but there is no pawn).
- If Nf3+, Kh3, then Ng5+ Kg4, h3+ Kf4, Kg2, etc.

But let's check for the fastest mate:

**Line 1: Nf3+**
- 1. Nf3+ Kh3 (only move)
- 2. Ng5+ Kg4 (only move)
- 3. h3+ Kf4 (only move)
- 4. Kg2 (threatening mate with Rf1-h1#)
- Black has no moves to prevent Rh1#

Alternatively, after 1. Nf3+ Kh3, 2. Ng5+ Kg4, 3. h3+ Kf4, 4. Kg2, Black is mated next move.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e5f3

2025-06-22 01:04:35,733 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.88s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, Rook on f1, Knight on f3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, h2
- Black: King on h5

**Material:** White is up a rook and a knight, with plenty of pawns. Black has only the king.

**Objective:** With such a material advantage, the goal is to checkmate Black as efficiently as possible, while avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- The Black king is on h5, with escape squares g4, g5, h4, h6, and g6.
- The knight on f3 can move to g5, e5, h4, d4, d2, or e1.
- The rook and king are far from the action, but can be brought closer.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **f3g5+**: Knight check. Black king must move to h4 or h6 (since g4 is covered by the knight, g5 is occupied, h5 is current square, h4 is available, h6 is available).
2. **f3h4+**: Knight check. Black king must move to h4 (illegal, occupied), so not possible.
3. **f3e5**: Centralizes the knight, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
4. **g1g2**: Bring the king closer.
5. **f1e1**: Bring the rook closer.

**Check for Stalemate:**
- If we check with the knight, Black will have at least one move.
- No stalemate risk with f3g5+.

**Best Plan:**
- Use the knight to check and restrict the Black king.
- Bring the rook and king closer to help with the mate.

**Best Move:**
- f3g5+ is the most forcing move, driving the king to the edge and keeping up the pressure.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f3g5
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King on g1, Rook on f1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, h2  
Black: King on g5

**White to move.**

**Assessment:**  
- White is up a rook and several pawns; Black has only a king.
- The only concern is to avoid stalemate and to convert efficiently.
- The Black king is on g5, so it has some mobility for now.
- White should activate the king and rook, and start pushing pawns, but must avoid stalemating the Black king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g1g2 – King centralization, but not urgent.
2. f1d1 – Rook cut-off, but not necessary yet.
3. h2h3 – Gives Black king less space, but not stalemate yet.
4. f2f4+ – Check, but after Kxf4, White loses a pawn.
5. f2f3 – Prepares to bring the king up, keeps pawns safe.
6. a2a4, b2b4, c2c4 – Pushing queenside pawns, but not urgent.

**Best plan:**  
- Bring the king up to support pawn advances and avoid stalemate.
- Rook can cut off the king later if needed.
- h2h3 is safe, but f2f3 is more flexible, keeping all options open.

**Check for stalemate after h2h3:**  
- Black king on g5 has f4, h4, h5, f5, g6, so not stalemate.

**Check for stalemate after f2f3:**  
- Black king still has plenty of moves.

**Between h2h3 and f2f3:**  
- h2h3 slightly restricts the Black king, but f2f3 is more flexible and supports king activation.

**Final move:**  
I will play the flexible and safe move, supporting king activation and keeping all options open.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King (g1), Rook (f1), Pawns (a2, b2, c2, f3, h2)  
Black: King (h5)

**White to move.**

**Strategic considerations:**
- White is up a rook and several pawns; this is a trivially won endgame with correct technique.
- The Black king is on the edge and cannot attack any pawns.
- White's plan: Activate the king, push pawns, and use the rook to cut off the Black king or assist in queening a pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g1g2**: King centralizes, prepares to support pawn advance.
2. **f1f2**: Rook supports pawn advances, but less active than king move.
3. **f3f4**: Immediate pawn push, but doesn't threaten anything yet.
4. **h2h3**: Gives luft, but not urgent.
5. **c2c3, b2b3, a2a3**: Pawn moves, but not urgent.
6. **g1f2**: King centralizes, best for endgame.

**Best move:**  
Centralizing the king is the most important step in winning this endgame. The king should head towards the center to support pawn advances and restrict the Black king.

Between **g1g2** and **g1f2**, both are good, but **g1f2** is slightly better as it heads directly towards the center and supports the pawns.

**Final move:**
```
g1f2

2025-06-22 01:04:54,375 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.16s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on f2, rook on f1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f3, h2
- Black: King on g5

**Material:** White is up a rook and several pawns. Black has only a king.

**Objective:** Convert the overwhelming material advantage to a win, avoiding stalemate and any unnecessary complications.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **King moves:** f2g3, f2e3, f2g2, f2e2, f2g1, f2e1 — All are safe, but not particularly pressing.
2. **Rook moves:** f1h1, f1g1, f1e1, f1d1, f1c1, f1b1, f1a1 — Lateral rook moves can help cut off the Black king.
3. **Pawn moves:** f3f4, h2h3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4 — Advancing pawns is the main plan, but must avoid stalemating the Black king.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- Black's king is on g5, not in a stalemate zone.
- Advancing the f-pawn with f3-f4 is safe and restricts the Black king further.
- Advancing the h-pawn with h2-h4 is also safe and helps in pushing Black's king to the edge.
- Rook moves like f1-g1 or f1-h1 can help cut off the Black king from the center.

**Best plan:** 
- Use the rook to cut off the Black king from the center (e.g., f1-g1), then advance the king and pawns.
- Alternatively, start pushing pawns (f4, h4) to restrict the Black king further.

**Checking for stalemate:** 
- After f3-f4, Black's king has h4, f4, f6, h6, so not stalemate.
- After h2-h4, Black's king has f4, h4, f6, h6, so not stalemate.
- After f1-g1, Black's king has f4, h4, f6, h6, so not stalemate.

**Long-term strategy:** 
- Cut off the Black king with the rook, then advance pawns with the support of the king.

**Short-term tactic:** 
- f3-f4 is a direct pawn advance, but f1-g1 is more precise, as it restricts the Black king and makes the win easier.

**Final decision:** 
- f1-g1 is the most precise move, cutting off the Black king and making the win trivial.

Let's analyze the position:

White: King on f2, rook on g1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f3, h2  
Black: King on h5

Material: White is up a rook and several pawns. Black has only a king.  
Objective: Convert the overwhelming material advantage to a win. Avoid stalemate.

Immediate tactical and strategic considerations:
- Black's king is on the edge (h5), so pushing pawns too quickly on the kingside could risk stalemate if not careful.
- White should activate the king and rook, and begin advancing pawns on the queenside and center, keeping the Black king boxed in.
- No immediate mate, but White can make progress safely.

Candidate moves:
1. f3-f4: Pushes a pawn, but doesn't help much immediately.
2. h2-h3: Gives luft for the king, but not urgent.
3. c2-c3, b2-b3, a2-a3: Start pushing queenside pawns.
4. g1-g4: Cuts off the Black king further, but could risk stalemate if not careful.
5. King moves: f2-g3, f2-e3, etc. Centralizing the king is always good in the endgame.

Best plan: Centralize the king, keep the rook active, and start pushing queenside pawns. No need to rush.

Among the candidate moves, the most prudent is to centralize the king, e.g., f2-e3. This keeps the king active and avoids any stalemate tricks.

Therefore, my move is:
```
f2e3
```

2025-06-22 01:05:05,697 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.71s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King (e3), Rook (g1), 4 pawns (a2, b2, c2, f3), 2 pawns (h2, h3)  
Black: King (h4)

**White to move.**

**Objective:**  
Convert this overwhelming material advantage into a win, ideally by forcing the Black king to the edge and then checkmating with rook and king, or by advancing pawns to promote.

**Immediate Candidate Moves:**
- King moves: e3-f4, e3-e4, e3-d4, e3-d3 (centralizing king, cutting off Black king)
- Rook moves: g1-g8, g1-g7, etc. (cutting off Black king)
- Pawn moves: f3-f4, h2-h3, c2-c3, b2-b3, a2-a3, c2-c4, b2-b4, a2-a4

**Key Principles:**
- Cut off the Black king from escaping to the center.
- Use the rook to restrict the Black king.
- Bring the king closer to help with mate or pawn promotion.

**Best Plan:**
- Rook to the 4th rank (g4) to cut off the Black king from escaping to the 4th rank.
- Then bring the king up to f4, e5, etc., and push pawns as needed.

**Calculation:**
1. Rg4+ forces the Black king to h3 or h5 (but h5 is not possible, only h3).
2. After ...Kh3, White can bring the king up (e.g., Kf4, then Kg5, etc.).
3. Alternatively, simply play Kf4, centralizing the king and keeping all options open.

But Rg4+ is a forcing move, pushing the Black king to the 3rd rank, making it easier to box in.

**Double-checking for any stalemate traps:**  
No immediate stalemate, as Black king has squares.

**Final Decision:**  
Play the rook to g4, cutting off the Black king.

2025-06-22 01:05:12,293 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.09s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King on e3, rook on g4, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f3, h2  
Black: King on h5

**White to move.**

**Immediate tactical considerations:**  
- The Black king is cut off on the h-file and is on the edge of the board.
- White's king is centralized and can support the rook and pawns.
- White's rook is very active and can cut off the Black king further or check.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g4g8** (Rook to 8th rank, cutting off the Black king)
2. **g4g7** (Rook to 7th rank, similar idea)
3. **g4g6** (Rook to 6th rank, but doesn't check or threaten much)
4. **e3f4** (King advances, but doesn't threaten anything immediate)
5. **e3e4** (King advances, but again, not urgent)
6. **h2h3** (Pawn move, slow)
7. **f3f4** (Pawn move, but doesn't threaten anything immediate)

**Best plan:**  
In king and rook vs king endgames, the standard technique is to cut the king off, push your king up, and then drive the enemy king to the edge and deliver mate. Here, the Black king is already on the edge. If we can cut it off from escaping to the g-file, we can proceed to bring our king up and deliver mate.

**Move analysis:**
- **g4g8**: Rook to 8th rank. The Black king is stuck on the h-file. Now, White can bring the king up to f5 and g6, and then mate with Rh8.
- **g4g7**: Similar, but the 8th rank is more standard for the rook in this technique.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- After **g4g8**, Black has only king moves (Kh6 or Kh4).
- White can then play Kf4-f5-g6, and mate with Rh8.

**Conclusion:**  
**g4g8** is the most precise move, cutting off the Black king and preparing to bring the king up for a textbook checkmate.

My move:
```
g4g8
```

Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on e3, rook on g8, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f3, h2
- Black: King on h4

White is completely winning. The Black king is cut off on the h-file, and White's rook on g8 is perfectly placed to restrict the Black king. The plan is simple: bring the king closer to the Black king to force mate. 

Candidate moves:
1. **e3f4**: King approaches the Black king, threatening to box him in.
2. **e3e4**: Also approaches, but f4 is more direct.
3. **h2h3**: Gives luft, but not necessary since Black has no checks or threats.
4. **g8h8**: Rook move, but unnecessary since the rook is already optimally placed.

Best move: **e3f4**. This brings the king closer and prepares to force mate. Black is helpless.

Final move:
```
e3f4

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on f4, rook on g8, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f3, h2
- Black: King on h3

**Material:** White has a rook and 5 pawns vs Black's lone king.

**Objective:** Checkmate Black as efficiently as possible.

**Candidate moves:**
- The Black king is on h3, so we want to restrict its movement and drive it to the edge/corner for a swift mate.
- The rook can cut off the king along the 8th rank, but the king is already on the edge.
- The king can approach to help with mate.
- Advancing pawns is unnecessary for mate, but may be useful for zugzwang if needed.

**Immediate checks:**
- g8g3+ is possible, but after ...Kh4, White needs to coordinate rook and king for mate.
- g8g7 is a waiting move, but doesn't threaten mate.
- f4f5, f4g5, f4e5, f4e4, f4e3: King moves to approach h-file.

**Best plan:** Bring the king closer to the h-file to support mate with the rook. The fastest way is to play f4f5, heading to f6/g6/g5, then rook to h8 for mate.

**Calculation:**
1. f4f5 (White king approaches)
   - Black only move: Kh4
2. f5g6 (King closer)
   - Black only move: Kh3
3. Rook to h8, then mate on next move.

Alternatively, Rg8h8 immediately, but then Black plays Kg2, and mate is delayed.

**Conclusion:** The fastest is to bring the king closer.

**Final move:**
```
f4f5

2025-06-22 01:05:29,104 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.02s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on f5, rook on g8, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f3, f5
- Black: King on h2

**Black's only piece is the king on h2. White has a rook, king, and five pawns.**

**Objective:** 
- Convert the overwhelming material advantage to a win, ideally as quickly as possible, but without allowing any stalemate tricks.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The Black king is on h2, boxed in by its own position and White's pieces.
- White's rook on g8 controls the g-file and can cut off the king further.
- White's king is on f5, close enough to help in the mate.
- Advancing pawns is safe, but we must avoid stalemating the Black king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Rook moves along the 8th rank (g8h8, g8f8, etc.) — don't seem to help immediately.
2. Rook moves along the g-file (g8g7, g8g6, etc.) — could help bring the rook closer to the king for a mating net.
3. King moves — f5g6, f5f6, f5e6, etc. — bringing the king closer to h-file to help with mate.
4. Pawn moves — c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4 — safe, but slow.

**Best plan:** 
- Bring the king to g3/h3 to help the rook deliver mate.
- The Black king is not in stalemate, as it has h1 and h3 squares (currently).
- Rook can swing to h8 to cut off the h-file, but only after the king is ready to assist.

**Immediate best move:**
- Move the king closer to the h-file, e.g., f5g6. This keeps the Black king boxed in and prepares to bring the king to h5/h4/h3 for mate.

**Check for stalemate:**
- After f5g6, Black's king still has h1 and h3 squares, so no stalemate.

**Final move:**
```
f5g6
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

White: King on g6, Rook on g8, pawns on f3, a2, b2, c2  
Black: King on g2

Material: White is up a rook and has a clear win. Black has only the king left.

Immediate threats: White can try to checkmate the Black king. The Black king is on g2, so let's see if we can force mate or drive the king to the edge.

Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Rook to h-file, preparing Rh2# if the king is on h2, but currently not possible.
- g8g7: Rook to g7, cutting off the king's escape to the 7th rank.
- g6h7: King to h7, but doesn't threaten anything.
- g6g7: King to g7, but doesn't threaten anything.
- f3f4: Advance the pawn, but not urgent.
- c2c3, b2b3, a2a3: Pawn moves, not urgent.

The best plan is to use the rook to cut off the Black king and drive it to the edge for a checkmate. The Black king is on g2, so let's try to cut off the 2nd rank.

Move: g8g7 (Rook to g7)
- This cuts off the Black king from advancing to the 3rd rank, and the White king can help drive the Black king to the edge for a textbook mate.

Final move:
```
g8g7

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King on g6, rook on g7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f3  
Black: King on f2

**Position:**  
- White's king and rook dominate the 7th and 6th ranks, cutting off the black king.
- White has a clear material advantage and can force checkmate.
- Black's king is on f2, with no pawns or pieces to help.

**Objective:**  
- The goal is to checkmate the black king as efficiently as possible.
- The rook and king can coordinate to drive the black king to the edge and deliver mate.

**Candidate moves:**  
- Rook moves: g7g8, g7h7, g7f7, g7e7, g7d7, g7c7, g7b7, g7a7
- King moves: g6h7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6h5, g6g5, g6f5
- Pawn moves: f3f4, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4

**Best plan:**  
- Use the rook to cut off the black king further, then bring the king closer if needed.
- The black king is on f2. If we play Rf7, the black king is forced to the e-file or g-file, but Rf7 allows Kxf3 (taking the pawn).
- If we play Rg8, the rook is not cutting off more squares.
- If we play Rf7, and black plays Kxf3, we can play Kf5 and drive the king to the edge.
- Alternatively, we can play Kf5 immediately, but that allows Kxf3.
- If we play f4, black can take the pawn.
- The rook should cut off the king from escaping to the center.

**Optimal move:**  
- Rook to f7 (g7f7) cuts off the king from the 7th rank and prepares to drive the king to the edge.

**Check for stalemate:**  
- After Rf7, black still has moves.

**Final move:**  
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g6, rook on f7, pawns on f3, c2, b2, a2
- Black: King on f1

**Material:** White has a rook and 4 pawns vs Black's lone king.

**Objective:** Checkmate Black as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate threats:** 
- Black's king is on f1, so we must avoid stalemating it.
- The rook can cut off the king's escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. f7f8: Rook to f8, keeping the king cut off.
2. f7h7: Rook to h7, preparing to bring the king closer.
3. f7g7: Rook to g7, but king is already on g6.
4. f7e7: Rook to e7, but not as effective as f8.
5. f7f6: Rook to f6, but king is already on g6.
6. g6h7: King to h7, but this moves away from the action.
7. g6g7: King to g7, but doesn't help.
8. f3f4: Pawn move, but not urgent.
9. c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4: Pawn moves, but not urgent.

**Best plan:** 
- Use the rook to cut off the king, then bring the king closer for mate.
- f7f8 is a classic move to cut off the king on the back rank, then walk the king to e2/d2 and deliver mate with Rf1.

**Check for stalemate:** 
- After f7f8, Black's king still has f2 and e2 as escape squares, so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:** 
The best move is to play f7f8, preparing to bring the king closer and deliver mate.

```

2025-06-22 01:05:54,482 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.85s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on g6, Rook on f8, pawns on f3, a2, b2, c2  
Black: King on f2

Material: White is up a rook and several pawns. Black has only the king left.

White to move. The Black king is on f2, and the White rook is on f8, cutting off the king from the 8th rank. The White king is on g6, close to the action. White's plan is to checkmate the Black king, ideally by forcing it to the edge of the board and delivering mate with the rook and king.

Candidate moves:
- Rook moves along the 8th rank: Not immediately useful for checkmate, but could reposition.
- King moves: g6-h7, g6-g7, g6-f7, g6-h6, g6-f6, g6-h5, g6-g5, g6-f5. Moving the king closer to the Black king is a standard technique in king and rook vs king endgames.
- Pawn moves: f3-f4, c2-c3, b2-b3, a2-a3, c2-c4, b2-b4, a2-a4. Not urgent; the focus should be on checkmating.

The best plan is to use the king and rook together to drive the Black king to the edge and deliver mate. The Black king is on f2, so let's bring our king closer.

The move g6-f5 brings the king closer to the Black king, but f5 is already controlled by the rook. g6-f7 is also possible, but f7 is occupied by the rook. g6-g5 brings the king closer along the g-file.

But the most direct way is to play:
- Kf5, bringing the king closer to the Black king, supporting the rook and restricting the Black king's movement.

But let's check if there is a faster way to force mate.

If we play:
- Rf8-f4, the Black king is forced to move, but it can go to e3 or g3 (if those squares are available). However, with the king on f2, Rf4+ is not check.

So, the best move is to bring the king closer.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g6f5
```

Let's analyze the position:

White: King on f5, Rook on f8, pawns on a2, b2, c2  
Black: King on f3

It's White to move.

**Material:** White is up a rook and three pawns, Black has only a king.  
**Threats:** White is completely winning. The only thing to watch for is stalemate, as Black's king is boxed in and could be stalemated if not careful.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rook moves: All along the 8th rank and to f7, f6.
- King moves: g6, f6, e6, g5, e5.
- Pawn moves: a2-a3/a4, b2-b3/b4, c2-c3/c4.

**Immediate tactics:**  
- Moving the rook off the 8th rank doesn't help, as the king is not in danger.
- Advancing pawns is safe, but must avoid stalemating the Black king.
- King moves: f5-g6, f5-f6, f5-e6, f5-g5, f5-e5.

**Check for stalemate:**  
If White moves the king to f6, Black's king is on f3 and still has squares (e3, g3, e2, f2, g2), so not stalemate.
If White moves the king to g6, Black's king still has f4, f2, e3, g3, etc.

**Best plan:**  
Advance the king to support pawn promotion, while keeping the rook on the 8th rank to cut off the Black king.

**Best move:**  
Move the king closer to the pawns to shepherd them up the board. f5-f6 is the most direct, but f5-g6 is also good.

**Final decision:**  
Move the king to g6, as it keeps maximum control and avoids any stalemate tricks.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g6, Rook on f8, pawns on a2, b2, c2
- Black: King on e4

**Material:** White is up a rook and three pawns vs. lone king.

**Objective:** Checkmate swiftly, avoid stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rook moves along the 8th rank:** f8-h8, f8-g8, etc.
2. **Rook moves along the f-file:** f8-f7, f8-f6, etc.
3. **King moves:** g6-h7, g6-g7, etc.
4. **Pawn moves:** a2-a3/a4, b2-b3/b4, c2-c3/c4

**Immediate threats:** 
- No immediate mate, but Black's king is centralized.
- Avoid stalemating Black's king (i.e., don't cut off all escape squares unless it's mate).

**Best plan:** 
- Use the rook to cut off the Black king, then bring the king closer, or advance pawns to restrict Black's king further.

**Best move candidates:**
- Rook to f2/f3/f4/f5 to cut off the king's escape to the f-file.
- Rook to f7 to prepare to bring the king closer.
- King moves: g6-f6, but that's not legal.
- Pawn moves: not urgent, but could help.

**Check for stalemate:** 
- If rook goes to f4, Black's king is not stalemated (can go to d5, d3, f3, f5).
- If rook goes to f5, Black's king is not stalemated (can go to d4, d3, f3, f5).
- If rook goes to f7, Black's king can move.

**Best move:**
- Rook to f2 is strong, but let's see if we can cut off the king more efficiently.
- Rook to f4 is good, as it restricts the king to the 4th rank and below.

**Final decision:** 
- **f8f4** is the most precise, cutting off the king and preparing to bring our king closer or advance pawns.

2025-06-22 01:06:14,837 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.97s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g6, Rook on f4, pawns on a2, b2, c2
- Black: King on e5

**Material:** White has a rook and 3 pawns vs Black king only.

**Objective:** Convert the material advantage to a win. The best method is to use the rook and king to force the black king back, then advance the pawns.

**Short-term tactics:** 
- The black king is centralized on e5.
- The rook on f4 is well-placed to cut off the black king from the 4th rank.
- The white king is active on g6.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g6h7**: King moves closer to the pawns, but not necessary now.
2. **f4f5+**: Check, but Black king can go to d5 or e6, not achieving much.
3. **f4f3**: Prepares to support pawn advance, but not urgent.
4. **c2c3**: Start advancing pawns.
5. **f4f1**: Rook to first rank, but not needed.
6. **f4f7**: Rook to 7th, but not effective now.
7. **f4g4**: Rook swing, but not needed.
8. **f4e4**: Rook to e4, but Black king can go to f5.

**Best plan:** Keep the black king cut off, and start pushing pawns. The rook on f4 already cuts the king from the 4th rank. Advancing the c-pawn is logical.

**Check for tactics:** Is there a forced mate or immediate win? No, but the win is straightforward.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to start advancing the c-pawn.

2025-06-22 01:06:20,849 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.64s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

White: King on g6, pawns on a2, b2, c3  
Black: King on f4  
It's White to move.

Material: White has three pawns (a2, b2, c3) and king; Black has only the king.

Objective: Convert the material advantage (three pawns) into a win. The Black king is close to the pawns, so we must be careful to avoid stalemate or losing pawns unnecessarily.

Candidate moves:
- King moves: g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6h5
- Pawn moves: c3c4, b2b3, a2a3, b2b4, a2a4

Analysis:
- King moves: Moving the king away from the pawns (e.g., h7, h6, h5) doesn't help. Moving closer (f7, f6) could help shepherd the pawns, but f7/f6 puts the king on the same file as the pawns, which is not ideal.
- Pawn moves: Advancing the c-pawn (c3c4) is logical, as it is protected by the king and starts the process of pushing the pawns forward. The Black king cannot immediately attack the c-pawn after c4, and White can support further advances.

Let's check c3c4:
- After c3c4, if Black plays ...Ke4, White can continue with b3 or a3, slowly advancing the pawns.
- If Black tries to approach via Ke5, White can play Kg5, keeping the king close to the pawns.

Other pawn moves (b2b3, a2a3, b2b4, a2a4) are also possible, but c3c4 is the most direct and keeps the king close to the action.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c3c4
```

2025-06-22 01:06:27,735 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.79s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g6, pawns on a2, b2, c4
- Black: King on g3
- White to move

**Material:** White has three pawns, Black has only the king.

**Objective:** Convert the material advantage to a win. Avoid stalemate and ensure Black's king cannot blockade the pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c4c5**: Advance the c-pawn. This is logical, as it keeps the king cut off and starts pushing the passed pawn.
2. **b2b3**: Prepares to support c4-c5, but not as direct.
3. **a2a3**: Similar, but less urgent.
4. **King moves**: The king is already well-placed, cutting off Black's king from the queenside.

**Analysis:**
- **c4c5**: If Black tries to approach with Kg4, White can continue with c6, and the king can support the pawns if needed. Black's king is too far to stop the pawns.
- **Other pawn moves**: Not as direct as c4c5.

**Stalemate check:** After c4c5, Black still has moves (Kg4, etc.), so no stalemate risk.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to push the c-pawn.

```

2025-06-22 01:06:33,874 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.26s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g6, pawns on a2, b2, c5
- Black: King on g4

**Material:** White has three pawns, Black has only the king.

**Goal:** Convert the advantage to a win. The main plan is to promote a pawn, but we must avoid stalemates and ensure the Black king cannot block our pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c5c6**: Advance the c-pawn. The Black king is too far to stop it. After c6, the pawn will promote quickly.
2. **g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6**: King moves. These don't help much; the king is already optimally placed to support the pawn.
3. **b2b3, a2a3, b2b4, a2a4**: Pawn moves on the queenside. These are not urgent; c5-c6 is more direct.

**Calculation after c5c6:**
- 1. c6 Kf5 (Black king tries to approach)
- 2. c7 (threatening c8=Q)
- 2... Ke6 (still too far)
- 3. c8=Q+ Kd6 (or any king move)
- White wins easily.

**Stalemate checks:** Advancing the c-pawn does not stalemate Black, as Black's king has plenty of moves.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to push the c-pawn.

Let's analyze the position:

White: King on g6, pawn on c6, pawns on a2 and b2  
Black: King on h3

It's White to move.

Key points:
- The c6 pawn is one step from promotion.
- The Black king is far from the c-pawn and cannot stop it.
- Black has no pawns or pieces left.
- Promoting the c-pawn is unstoppable.

Candidate moves:
1. c6c7: Push the pawn, threatening to promote next move.
2. King moves: Not necessary, as the pawn is the main asset.
3. Pawn moves on a/b files: Not urgent.

Best move:
- c6c7 is the most direct and decisive, threatening c8=Q next move. Black cannot stop the promotion.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c6c7

Let's analyze the position:

White: King on g6, pawn on c7, pawns on a2, b2  
Black: King on g3  
White to move.

The most critical feature is the pawn on c7, which is one square from promotion. Black's king is far from stopping it. Promoting to a queen is the most direct way to win, as Black has no counterplay and cannot stop White's new queen.

Let's check if there are any stalemate tricks:
- After c7-c8=Q, Black's king is on g3 and has moves (h3, f3, h4, f4, etc.), so not stalemate.
- Promoting to a queen is the fastest and safest win.

No need to consider underpromotion, as there are no stalemate or perpetual check threats.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c7c8q
```

2025-06-22 01:06:56,400 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.97s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** `2Q5/8/6K1/8/8/5k2/PP6/8 w - - 1 92`

- White: King on g6, Queen on c8, pawns on a2, b2
- Black: King on f3

It's White to move. Black's king is cut off from the queenside, and White's queen and king are well placed to force mate.

Let's look for the fastest checkmate or a move that restricts Black's king further.

**Candidate moves:**
- c8c3+ (Queen to c3, check)
- c8f5+ (Queen to f5, check)
- c8h3 (Queen to h3, no check but covers escape squares)
- c8c4 (Queen to c4, no check but restricts king)
- g6f5 (King move, but doesn't threaten mate)

Let's check the checks:

1. **c8c3+**: Black king can only go to e4.
2. **c8f5+**: Black king can only go to g2.
3. **c8h3**: No check, but covers h3 and g2.

Let's calculate:

- **c8c3+** f3-e4
    - Now, Qc3-e5# is checkmate.

So, **c8c3+** is a forced mate in 2.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c8c3
```

2025-06-22 01:07:02,849 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.63s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g6, Queen on c3, pawns on a2, b2
- Black: King on e2

**Objective:** 
- White is completely winning. The Black king is cut off, and White can force mate quickly.

**Immediate tactics:**
- The Black king is on e2. Let's see if there is a forced mate or a way to restrict the king further.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c3e5+**: King must move to f2 or d2. But after Kf2, Qf4+ wins instantly.
2. **c3c2+**: King must move to d1 or f1, but both are not possible. So, not a check.
3. **c3f3**: Not a check, but threatens mate on f2.
4. **g6f5**: King move, but not forcing.
5. **c3d2+**: King must move to f1 or d1, but both are not possible.

**Check all checks:**
- **c3e5+**: Only legal move for Black is Kf2.
  - Then Qf4+ forces Kg2, then Qg3# is mate.

So, let's check the sequence:
1. Qe5+ Kf2
2. Qf4+ Kg2
3. Qg3#

This is forced mate in 3.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c3e5
```

2025-06-22 01:07:10,224 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.55s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g6, Queen on e5, pawns on a2, b2
- Black: King on f1

**It's White to move.**

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- Black's king is on f1, boxed in by its own position and the White queen.
- White's queen on e5 controls many escape squares.
- White's king on g6 is far from the action but can help in the long run.
- White has two pawns on a2 and b2, which can be advanced, but the main focus should be on checkmating the Black king.

**Checkmate threats:**
- Let's look for immediate mate threats:
    - e5 move options: e5e1 is check, but Black can only move to g2 or f2, but those are not available.
    - e5f4 is not check.
    - e5e2 is check, but the king can't go to e2.
    - e5g3 is not check.
    - e5h2 is not check.
    - e5h5 is not check.
    - e5e4 is not check.
    - e5e8 is not check.

**Checkmate in one?**
- e5e1 is check. Let's see if that's mate:
    - e5e1: Queen to e1, check. Black king is on f1.
    - Squares available to Black king: e2, f2, g2, e1, f1, g1.
    - e2 is not available (queen controls it).
    - f2 is not available (queen controls it).
    - g2 is not available (queen controls it).
    - e1 is occupied by the queen.
    - f1 is occupied by the king.
    - g1 is not available (queen controls it).

So, after e5e1, Black's king has no legal moves. This is checkmate.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to deliver checkmate in one with the queen.

2025-06-22 01:07:16,003 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.84s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on g6, pawns on a2 and b2.
- Black: King on e1.

White to move.

Material: White has two pawns and a king vs Black's lone king. This is a trivially won endgame for White, but precision is needed to avoid stalemate or unnecessary delays.

Objectives:
- Promote a pawn, ideally with the king's support.
- Avoid stalemating the Black king.
- Keep the Black king confined.

Candidate moves:
1. Advance the a-pawn: a2-a3 or a2-a4.
2. Advance the b-pawn: b2-b3 or b2-b4.
3. King moves: g6-h7, g6-g7, g6-f7, g6-h6, g6-f6, g6-h5, g6-g5, g6-f5.

King moves don't help much right now, as the king is already optimally placed to support the pawns and cut off the Black king.

Between a2-a4 and b2-b4, both are fine, but a2-a4 is slightly better as it keeps the pawns on different files, making it harder for the Black king to blockade both.

Let's check if there are any stalemate traps: Black's king is on e1 and has moves, so no immediate stalemate.

Best move: advance the a-pawn.

Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on g6, pawns on a4 and b2.
- Black: King on d1.

White to move.

**Material:** White has two pawns (a4, b2) and a king (g6). Black has only a king (d1).

**Objective:** Convert the material advantage (two pawns) into a win. The Black king is far from the pawns, so White should push the pawns and support them with the king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a4-a5: Advance the a-pawn.
2. b2-b3: Prepare to support the a-pawn with b4.
3. b2-b4: Directly advance the b-pawn.
4. King moves: g6-h7, g6-g7, etc.

**Analysis:**
- Advancing the a-pawn (a4-a5) is strong, as it is closest to queening and the Black king is far away.
- Advancing the b-pawn (b2-b4) is also good, but a4-a5 is more direct.
- King moves do not help immediately, as the king is already well placed to stop any Black counterplay and can support the pawns if needed.

**Best move:** a4-a5. This pushes the most advanced pawn and keeps the winning plan simple.

Final move:
```
a4a5
```

White's plan is to promote the a-pawn, but Black's b-pawn is also close to queening. The kings are far from the pawns, so it's a race.

Let's check the pawn races:

1. a5-a6
   - Black plays b2-b3
   - a6-a7, b3-b2
   - a7-a8Q, b2-b1Q

But after a5-a6, Black can play b2-b3, and both sides promote.

Alternatively, can White use the king to help? The king is too far from the pawns to help directly.

If White plays a5-a6, Black will push b2-b3, and both sides will queen.

Let's calculate:

1. a5a6 b2b3
2. a6a7 b3b2
3. a7a8Q b2b1Q

Both sides queen, but White queens first and can give checks.

Let's analyze the position:

White: King on g6, pawn on a6, pawn on b2  
Black: King on b1

It's White to move.

**Immediate thoughts:**
- The a6 pawn is one square from queening.
- The Black king is far from the a-file and cannot stop the a-pawn.
- The White king is also far from the a-file, but Black has no pawns and cannot create counterplay.
- Promoting the a-pawn seems decisive.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a6a7 — Push the a-pawn, threatening to queen next move.
2. King moves (g6h7, g6g7, etc.) — These do not contribute to the immediate plan.
3. b2b3 or b2b4 — Not urgent, as the a-pawn is the main asset.

**Calculation:**
- After a6a7, Black cannot stop a8=Q.
- Black's king is too far to interfere.
- On the next move, White will play a8=Q and win easily.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to push the a-pawn.

Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on g6, pawn on a7, pawn on b2
- Black: King on c1

It's White to move. The a7 pawn is one step from promotion, and Black's king is far away on c1. There are no Black pawns or pieces left.

Candidate moves:
- a7a8Q (promote to queen)
- a7a8R (promote to rook)
- a7a8B (promote to bishop)
- a7a8N (promote to knight)
- King moves (g6h7, g6g7, etc.)
- b2b3, b2b4

Analysis:
- Promoting the a7 pawn to a queen (a7a8q) is the most direct way to win. Black's king is too far to stop the new queen, and White will easily win.
- Promoting to a rook, bishop, or knight is unnecessary and only delays victory.
- King or b-pawn moves do not press the advantage.

Therefore, the best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

2025-06-22 01:07:50,475 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.96s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: Queen on a8, King on g6, Pawn on b2
- Black: King on d1

White to move.

The Black king is on d1, and White's queen is on a8. The White king is on g6, far from the Black king, but the queen can easily cut off the Black king and force mate.

Candidate moves:
1. a8a2: Queen cuts off the Black king from escaping to the second rank.
2. a8a1: Queen checks, but the Black king can move to c2.
3. a8d8: Queen cuts off the Black king from the d-file.
4. a8e4: Queen centralizes and covers more squares.
5. b2b4: Advance the pawn, but this is slow and unnecessary.
6. g6h7: King move, but unnecessary.

The fastest way to checkmate is to use the queen to cut off the Black king and drive it to the edge, then bring the king closer if needed.

Let's check if a direct mate is possible:
- a8a2: Black king has no escape to the second rank, only c1, e1, c2, e2 are possible, but all are covered except c2 and e2.
- a8d8: Black king can't move to d2, but can go to c1 or e1.

But let's check if a direct check is possible:
- a8a1: Check, Black king moves to c2.
- a8c6: Check, Black king moves to c1.

So, no immediate mate. Let's try to cut off the king.

a8a2 is a strong move, restricting the Black king to the first rank, and then we can bring our king closer for a forced mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
a8a2
```
