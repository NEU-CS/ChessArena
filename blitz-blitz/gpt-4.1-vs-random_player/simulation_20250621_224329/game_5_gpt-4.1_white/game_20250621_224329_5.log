Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of a chess game. As White, I have the first move. The best opening moves are those that control the center and develop pieces efficiently. The two most popular and strongest moves are 1.e4 and 1.d4. Both control the center and open lines for the queen and bishop.

Between the two, 1.e4 is slightly more aggressive and leads to open games, which is often preferable when playing for a win.

Therefore, my move is:
```
e2e4
```

2025-06-22 01:09:08,003 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.56s):
Let's analyze the position:

1. e4 g5

Black's move g5 is highly committal and weakens the kingside, especially the f5 and h5 squares. White should look to exploit this. The most direct way is to attack the g5 pawn and the weakened kingside.

Candidate moves:
- d1h5: Queen check, immediately punishing the g5 push. If ...Ke7, White can continue with Qxg5+ and disrupt Black's development.
- d2d4: Occupies the center, but less direct.
- h2h4: Attacks the g5 pawn, but Black can respond with ...g4.
- b1c3: Develops a piece, but not as forcing.
- g1f3: Develops a piece and attacks g5, but again, not as forcing as Qh5.

Let's calculate d1h5:

1. e4 g5 2. Qh5
- If ...h6, then h4 wins a pawn (hxg5 is coming).
- If ...Nf6, Qxg5.
- If ...e6, h4.
- If ...Bg7, Qxg5.

Black's only way to block the check is ...Ke7, which is awkward and loses castling rights.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d1h5
```

2025-06-22 01:10:17,458 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.02s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1.e4 g5 2.Qh5 b6**

- Black's kingside is extremely weak, especially the dark squares.
- The g5 pawn move has fatally weakened f7 and h7.
- Black's king is still in the center, and the bishop on f8 is undeveloped.
- White's queen is on h5, eyeing f7 and h7.
- White has a huge lead in development and attacking chances.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qh5xf7+**: This is a direct check, attacking the king and threatening to win material or even checkmate if Black is careless.
2. **Qh5xh7**: Captures the h7 pawn, threatening Qxh8, but Black can block with Nf6.
3. **Qh5g5**: Retreat, but not necessary.
4. **Nf3**: Develops, but not urgent compared to the threats.
5. **Bc4**: Develops, but again, not as forcing as the queen moves.

Let's analyze the most forcing moves:

### 1. Qh5xf7+
- If ...Kxf7, then Bc4+ wins the queen after e6 (Qf3+ picks up the rook on a8).
- If ...#Nxf7 is not possible.
- If ...#e6, then Qxe6+ is devastating.

### 2. Qh5xh7
- If ...Nf6, then Qh3 or Qf5, but Black can defend.
- If ...Rxh7, then Bc4 threatens mate, but Black can defend with e6.

### 3. Qh5h7
- If ...Nf6, then Qh3, but again, not as forcing.

### 4. Qh5g5
- Retreat, not necessary.

### 5. Qh5f7+
- This is the same as Qh5xf7+.

### Let's calculate Qh5xf7+ in detail:

1. Qh5xf7+ Kxf7 (forced)
2. Bc4+ e6 (forced)
3. Qf3+ Ke8 (if ...Kg7, Qf7#)
4. Qxa8

White wins a rook and remains with a crushing attack.

Alternatively, after 1. Qh5xf7+ Kd8, White can play d4 or Nc3, and Black's king is stuck in the center.

**Conclusion:**  
The move **Qh5xf7+** is the most forcing, wins material, and keeps Black's king in the center.

My move:
```
h5f7

2025-06-22 01:11:26,529 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.62s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1. e4 g5 2. Qh5 b6 3. Qxf7+ Kxf7**

- Black's king is on f7, exposed and unable to castle.
- White's queen is off the board, so White is down significant material, but Black's king safety is compromised.
- White has a lead in development and can rapidly bring pieces into the attack.
- Black's queenside is slightly weakened (b6), and the king is vulnerable on f7.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bc4+** (f1c4): Develops a piece with tempo, checks the king, and forces Black to respond.
2. **Nf3**: Develops a knight, threatens Ng5+ ideas, but not with check.
3. **d4**: Opens the center, but not forcing.
4. **h4**: Not urgent, as the attack is on the king.
5. **a4, b3, etc.**: Not relevant to the immediate attack.

**Let's look at 1. Bc4+:**
- Black's responses:
  - ...e6 (blocks with pawn)
  - ...d5 (blocks with pawn)
  - ...Kg7 (king moves)
  - ...Ke8 (king moves back)
  - ...Kf6 (king moves forward, but that looks dangerous)

If 1. Bc4+ e6, White can continue with d4, Qh5, or Nf3, building up pressure. If 1. ...d5, then Bxd5+ wins a pawn and keeps the king in the center.

**Other moves:**
- Nf3: Not with check, so Black can consolidate.
- d4: Not with check, so Black can play ...e6 or ...Bg7.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play Bc4+, developing with tempo and keeping Black's king in the center.

My move:
```
f1c4
```

2025-06-22 01:12:50,625 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.38s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 4...e6:**
- White: King on e1, Queen off the board, Bishop on c4, Knights on b1 and g1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on f7, Queen on d8, Bishop on f8, Knight on b8 and g8, pawns on a7, b6, c7, d7, e6, g5, h7.

**Key points:**
- Black's king is exposed on f7.
- White has a bishop on c4, eyeing the e6 pawn and the f7 king.
- White is ahead in development; Black's queenside is undeveloped.
- White is down a queen for two pawns, but Black's king is very unsafe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bc4xe6+**: Immediate check, forcing Black to respond. If d7xe6, White can play d2-d4, opening the center with Black's king exposed.
2. **Bc4-a6**: Attacks the rook on a8, but not forcing.
3. **Bc4-d5**: Centralizes the bishop, attacks the rook on a8 and the pawn on g5, but not a check.
4. **Developing moves**: Nc3, d4, etc., but the king is exposed, so direct action is better.

**Let's calculate 1. Bxe6+:**
- 1. Bxe6+ d7xe6 (forced, otherwise king moves and loses castling rights, but king is already moved)
- Now, White can play d2-d4, opening the center, or Qh5 (but queen is off), or Nf3, but the most forcing is to open the center.

But let's check if Black can avoid taking the bishop:
- 1. Bxe6+ Kf6 (only other legal move, but then Qf7 is not possible, and White can play Qf3+ or d4, but White's queen is off the board).

**So, 1. Bxe6+ is the most forcing move, and Black must take with the pawn.**

**After 1. Bxe6+ dxe6:**
- White can play d2-d4, opening the center, with Black's king on f7 and unable to castle.
- White can also develop quickly with Nf3, Nc3, etc.

**But the most forcing move is 1. Bxe6+.**

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c4e6
```

2025-06-22 01:14:25,464 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 10.27s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 6...Kg6:**
- Black's king is on g6, very exposed.
- White's bishop is on e6, dominating diagonals and controlling key squares.
- White's queen is off the board (traded for a rook and pawn), but White has a huge lead in development and Black's king is in grave danger.
- White's king is safe on e1, with castling rights.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped, and the king is stuck in the center/kingside.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. **Bf5+ (e6f5)**: This is a check, forcing the king to h6 or f7. If ...Kh6, then h4 is very strong, threatening hxg5+ and Qh5# ideas if the queen were present, but here the bishop and pawns can still attack.
2. **Bxd7 (e6d7)**: Captures a pawn, but less forcing.
3. **Bf7 (e6f7)**: Retreat, but not threatening.
4. **Nc3 (b1c3)**: Develops, but not forcing.
5. **h4**: Prepares to open the h-file, but not forcing.

**Let's calculate Bf5+ (e6f5):**
- 7. Bf5+ Kf7 (only legal move, as Kh6 is met by h4 and g5 falls)
- After Kf7, White can play d4, Qh5, or Nf3, but the queen is off the board.
- Alternatively, after Bf5+ Kf7, White can play d4, opening the center and threatening Qh5 ideas if the queen were present, but here the bishop and pawns can still attack.

**What about Bxg4 (e6g4)?**
- 7. Bxg4, but this just wins a pawn, not as forcing as Bf5+.

**What about e4-e5?**
- 7. e5, attacking the knight, but Black has no knight on f6.

**What about h4?**
- 7. h4, threatening h5+, but Black can respond with h6.

**What about Nf3?**
- 7. Nf3, developing, but not forcing.

**Back to Bf5+ (e6f5):**
- 7. Bf5+ Kf7 (forced)
- Now, d4 threatens to open the center, but Black can play exf5.
- Alternatively, White can play Nc3, developing and preparing d4.

**What about Bxg4 (e6g4)?**
- 7. Bxg4, but again, not as forcing.

**What about Bxd7 (e6d7)?**
- 7. Bxd7, wins a pawn, but not as forcing.

**What about h4?**
- 7. h4, threatening h5+, but Black can play h6.

**What about Nc3?**
- 7. Nc3, developing, but not forcing.

**Conclusion:**
- The most forcing move is **Bf5+**, putting the king in check and forcing it to move.
- After Bf5+ Kf7, White can continue development with Nc3, d4, or even h4, keeping Black's king exposed and unable to castle.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e6f5

2025-06-22 01:15:39,837 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.77s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 8 Pawns, King on e1, Bishop on f5
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 7 Pawns, King on f7

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on f7, with no pawn cover on the g and e files.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Threats:**
- White's bishop on f5 is very active, eyeing the h7 and g6 squares.
- Black's king is vulnerable to checks and mating nets.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **f5h7**: Bishop to h7, check. King must move to g7 or e8.
2. **f5d7**: Bishop to d7, check. King must move to g8 or g6.
3. **f5g6**: Bishop to g6+, check. King must move to g8 or f8.
4. **f5e6**: Retreat, not forcing.
5. **f5g4/h3**: Not forcing.
6. **Developing moves**: Not urgent, as Black's king is exposed.

Let's calculate the forcing lines:

**1. f5h7+**
- If ...Kg7, then Qg6# is mate.
- If ...Ke8, then Qf7# is mate.

**2. f5d7+**
- If ...Kg8, then Qg6# is mate.
- If ...g6, then Qg6# is mate.

**3. f5g6+**
- If ...Kg8, then Qg6# is mate.
- If ...Kf8, then Qf7# is mate.

All three moves (f5h7+, f5d7+, f5g6+) seem to lead to mate in one after the king moves.

But let's check the most forcing and direct move:

**f5h7+**
- ...Kg7: Qg6#
- ...Ke8: Qf7#

**f5d7+**
- ...Kg8: Qg6#
- ...Ke8: Qf7#

**f5g6+**
- ...Kg8: Qg6#
- ...Kf8: Qf7#

All three are mate in two, but f5h7+ is the most forcing and direct, as it restricts the king's movement.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f5h7
```

2025-06-22 01:16:23,819 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (h7):**
- White: King on e1, Knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on f7, pawns on a7, b6, c7, d7, e6, g5, h6, Bishop on f8, Queen on d8, Rook on a8, Knight on h6

White's bishop is on h7, threatening to capture on g8 or g6, but both are protected by Black's knight and pawn, respectively.

**Material:**
- White is up a piece (bishop for a pawn).
- Black's king is exposed on f7.
- White's development is behind, but Black's is even worse.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h7g8: Bishop takes rook, but Black recaptures with knight (h6xg8), trading bishop for rook and knight. This is a material gain (exchange up).
2. Develop pieces: b1c3, g1f3, etc.
3. Central break: e4e5, but Black can play ...Bg7 or ...Nc6.
4. King safety: e1e2, e1f1, but not urgent.
5. h2h4: Not urgent.

**Calculation:**
- h7g8: BxR, N(h6)xg8. White is up the exchange (rook for bishop). White can then develop rapidly and attack the exposed king.
- h7g6: Bxg6+, Kxg6, White loses the bishop for a pawn.
- h7f5: Bxf5, exf5, White loses the bishop for a pawn.

**Best move:**
- h7g8 is the best move, winning the exchange and keeping up the pressure.

**Final move:**
```
h7g8
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbq1bnr/p1pp1k2/1p6/6p1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 0 9

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, both rooks, both bishops, both knights, 8 pawns
- Black: Queen, both rooks, both bishops, both knights, 7 pawns (Black is missing the f-pawn)

**King safety:**
- Black's king is on f7, exposed and unable to castle.
- White's king is on e1, can castle both sides, and is safe.

**Development:**
- White: Only the king and queenside pieces are undeveloped, but White has a big lead in development potential.
- Black: King is exposed, queenside undeveloped, and f7 is weak.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. Develop a knight: g1f3 or g1h3 (f3 is more active)
2. Develop queenside: b1c3 (hits d5, supports e4-e5)
3. Push e4-e5: attacks the pinned knight on g8, opens the center with Black's king exposed
4. d2-d4: claim the center
5. h2-h4: start a pawn storm, but not urgent

**Critical tactical ideas:**
- e4-e5 is very tempting, opening the center with Black's king on f7.
- If ...d6, then Qf3+ is coming.
- If ...Nc6, then d4 or Nf3.

**Calculation of e4-e5:**
- e4-e5 d5 (trying to block) exd6 Bxd6 (now Qf3+ is strong)
- e4-e5 Nc6 (developing) d4 (threatening Qf3+)
- e4-e5 Bb7 (developing) d4

**Calculation of Nf3:**
- g1f3 Nf6 (developing) e5 (attacking) Ng4 (threatening ...Nxe5) Nxg5+ (if possible)

**Conclusion:**
- e4-e5 is the most aggressive, opening the center with Black's king exposed and behind in development. White should open the position immediately.

My move:
```
e4e5

2025-06-22 01:18:19,830 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.07s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 10...Ke7:**
- Black's king is on e7, unable to castle and exposed.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped (b8, c8, a8 pieces unmoved).
- Black's kingside bishop and knight are gone.
- Black's pawn structure: b6, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7, a7 (a7 and d7 are still unmoved).
- White's pieces: All minor pieces are on their original squares, but White has a lead in development potential and a safer king.
- White's pawn structure: a2, b2, c2, d2, e5, f2, g2, h2.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. **e5-e6**: Immediate pawn thrust, opening lines against the exposed king. If d7xe6, White can develop with tempo (e.g., Nf3, Ba3).
2. **Nf3**: Develops a piece, attacks g5, prepares to castle.
3. **Nc3**: Develops a piece, eyes d5 and b5.
4. **d4**: Opens the center, but Black's king is still in the center.
5. **h4**: Not urgent.
6. **f4**: Not urgent.

**Critical lines:**
- **e5-e6**: If Black plays d7xe6, White can play d4, opening the center further. If f7xe6, White can play d4 or Nf3, again with initiative.
- **Nf3**: Safe development, but not as forcing as e5-e6.
- **Nc3**: Same as above.

**Strategic considerations:**
- Black's king is stuck in the center and vulnerable.
- White should open the center as quickly as possible to exploit the king's position.
- e5-e6 is the most direct way to open lines.

**Tactical check:**
- After e5-e6, if d7xe6, White can play d4, threatening d5+.
- If f7xe6, White can play d4 as well.
- If Black ignores and plays something like Nc6, White can play exd7+.

**Conclusion:**
The most principled and aggressive move is to play e5-e6, opening the center and attacking the exposed king.

My move:
```
e5e6
```

2025-06-22 01:19:19,457 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.81s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position (after 10...Ke6xe6):**
- Black's king is on e6, exposed in the center.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped (b8, c8, d8 pieces unmoved).
- Black has a pawn on b6 and g5.
- White has all pieces except the light-squared bishop and king on their original squares.
- White to move.

**Immediate considerations:**
- Black's king is very exposed on e6, so White should try to open the center and develop quickly to exploit this.
- Moves like d2-d4 or f2-f4 come to mind to open lines.
- Developing pieces with tempo (Nf3, Nc3) is also attractive.
- The move d2-d4 directly challenges the center and opens lines for the queen and bishop.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d2d4 — Opens the center, threatens d5+ (fork), and develops.
2. Nf3 — Develops a piece, eyes e5 and g5.
3. Nc3 — Develops a piece, eyes d5.
4. f4 — Opens the f-file, but less direct than d4.
5. h4 — Not urgent.

**Tactical check:**
- d4 threatens d5+, forking king and queen.
- After d4, if ...d5, then Nf3 or Nc3, and White has a lead in development.
- If Black ignores and plays ...Bb7, then d5+ is strong.

**Best move:**
- d2d4 is the most principled, opening the center while Black's king is exposed.

**Final move:**
```
d2d4
```

2025-06-22 01:20:35,678 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.58s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbq1bnr/p1ppk3/1p6/6p1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 1 12

**White to move.**

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 6 Pawns

**King safety:**
- Black's king is on e7, unable to castle, and somewhat exposed.
- White's king is on e1, can still castle kingside or queenside.

**Development:**
- White: Only the queen's bishop and knight are undeveloped, but can be developed quickly.
- Black: Has not developed any minor pieces; only moved pawns and the king.

**Immediate threats:**
- No direct threats, but Black's king is exposed and behind in development.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b1c3**: Develops the knight, attacks d5 and e4, prepares to bring more pieces into play.
2. **c1g5**: Develops the bishop, pins the knight if it comes to f6, eyes the weak e7 square.
3. **d4d5**: Opens the center, but Black's pieces are undeveloped, so this could be strong.
4. **g1f3**: Develops the knight, eyes e5 and g5.
5. **c2c4**: Gains space and prepares to develop the knight to c3.
6. **e1e2**: King move, but unnecessary now.

**Critical analysis:**
- Black's king is stuck in the center; opening the center with d4-d5 could be strong.
- However, developing pieces first (especially the queenside knight and bishop) is standard.
- b1c3 develops a piece and supports d5 in the future.
- c1g5 develops a piece and could be annoying for Black, but Black can play ...Nf6 and block.
- d4d5 is tempting, but after ...Nf6, Black starts to develop.

**Best move:**
- Develop with tempo, keep the initiative, and prepare to open the center when ready.
- **b1c3** is the most principled move: develops a piece, supports d5, and keeps options open.

**Final move:**
```
b1c3
```

2025-06-22 01:21:45,720 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.51s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King on e1, knight on c3, pawns on d4, c2, b2, a2, f2, g2, h2, rook on a1, bishop on c1, knight on g1  
- Black: King on e6, bishop on f8, knight on b8, queen on d8, rook on a8, pawns on a7, b6, c7, d7, g5

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on e6, with no pawn cover and no pieces nearby for defense.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Development:**  
- White is ahead in development. Black's queenside pieces are undeveloped.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can try to open the center or attack the exposed king.
- Moves like d4-d5 or knight jumps to d5 look promising, as they attack the king and threaten forks.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c3-d5:** Knight jumps to d5, attacking the black king and threatening forks (e.g., knight forks on c7 or f6). If Black takes with the queen, White can play d4-d5, opening the center.
2. **d4-d5:** Directly attacks the king, opening the center. If exd5, then knight takes on d5 with check.
3. **c1xg5:** Bishop takes pawn, threatening to bring more pieces into the attack.
4. **c1-f4:** Developing the bishop with a tempo, attacking c7 and possibly preparing d5.

Let's analyze **c3-d5** in detail:
- If ...Ke7, then Bxg5+ wins material and keeps the king in the center.
- If ...Kf7, then Qh5+ is coming soon after development.
- If ...Kd6, then b3 or b4 can harass the king further.
- If ...exd5, then exd5+ opens the e-file and White can bring the rook to e1.

**d4-d5** is also strong, but after ...Ke7, White needs to find a follow-up.

**c1xg5** is tempting, but Black can play ...Be7 and try to trade off.

**Conclusion:**  
The move **c3-d5** is the most forcing and brings the knight to a dominating position, threatening forks and keeping the king exposed.

My move:
```
c3d5

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, rook on a1, bishop on c1, knight on d5, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e6, rook on a8, bishop on f8, knight on b8, queen on d8, pawns on a7, b6, c7, d6, g5

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on e6.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Tactics:**
- The knight on d5 is very strong, attacking e7 and c7.
- The move d5xc7+ is a check, forking the king and the rook on a8.
- d5e7+ is also a check, but after Bxe7, White loses the knight.
- d5f6+ is a check, but after Kxf6, White loses the knight.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. d5c7+ (Knight takes c7, check, forking king and rook)
2. d5e7+ (Knight to e7, check)
3. c1g5 (Develop bishop, threaten mate ideas)
4. h2h4 (Try to open kingside)

**Calculation:**
- d5c7+ Kf7 (forced), Nxa8 (win the rook), Black can try ...Bb7, but White is up a rook.
- d5e7+ Bxe7, White loses the knight for a bishop.
- c1g5, Black can play Nf6 or Be7, but White isn't threatening immediate tactics.
- h2h4, not urgent.

**Conclusion:**
- d5c7+ is the strongest move, winning material by forking the king and rook.

2025-06-22 01:23:50,136 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.34s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, Knight on c7, Bishop on c1, Rooks on a1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on f7, Bishop on f8, Knight on b8, Queen on d8, Rook on a8, pawns on a7, b6, d6, g5

**Key points:**
- White's knight on c7 is very active, attacking the rook on a8 and the bishop on f8.
- Black's king is exposed on f7.
- White is ahead in development and has a strong initiative.
- The move c7e8+ is a check, forking the king and the rook on a8.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c7e8+**: Knight check, attacking the king and threatening to capture the rook on a8. If ...Qxe8, White wins the exchange after Bxg5.
2. **c7a8**: Captures the rook immediately, but loses the knight after ...Bb7.
3. **c7e6**: Forks the king and queen, but the king can move to g8 or g6.
4. **c7a6**: Attacks the b6 pawn, but not as forcing.
5. **c1g5**: Develops with tempo, but less forcing than the knight checks.

**Analysis:**
- **c7e8+** is the most forcing move. After ...Qxe8, White can continue with Bxg5, winning a pawn and keeping the initiative. If ...Kxe8, White can play Bxg5, and Black's king remains exposed.
- **c7e6+** is interesting, but after ...Kxe6, White doesn't have a direct follow-up, and the knight is hanging.
- **c7a8** wins the exchange, but the knight is likely trapped after ...Bb7.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is the forcing check **c7e8+**, which wins material and keeps the initiative.

My move:
```
c7e8
```

2025-06-22 01:24:55,223 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.95s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb1Nbnr/p2q1k2/1p1p4/6p1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ - 3 16

- White to move.
- Material: White is up a full rook and a pawn.
- Black's king is on f7, exposed.
- Black's queen is on d7, bishop on f8 and knight on b8, but the rest of Black's pieces are undeveloped.
- White's knight is on e8, attacking the queen and threatening to jump to f6+ or d6+.
- White's king is on e1, safe.
- White's development is okay, but the c1 bishop and queenside are undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e8f6+**: Knight check, king must move (g7 or e6), or bishop blocks (g7), or queen blocks (Ke6 loses queen).
2. **e8g7**: Knight captures bishop, but not check.
3. **e8d6+**: Knight check, king must move (g8, e6, g7), or queen blocks (Qxd6).
4. **e8c7**: Retreats knight, not forcing.
5. **c1g5**: Develops bishop, threatens f6.
6. **d4d5**: Opens center, but not forcing.

**Tactical considerations:**
- **e8f6+** is a forcing move. Let's see the responses:
    - If ...Kxf6, White can play d4-d5+ forking king and queen.
    - If ...Kg7, White can play Nxd7, winning the queen.
    - If ...Bxf6, White can play d4-d5, opening the center with tempo.
- **e8d6+**: If ...Qxd6, White exchanges queens and remains up material.
- **e8g7**: Captures a bishop, but not check, and loses the knight after ...Bxg7.

**Calculation of e8f6+:**
1. e8f6+ Kxf6
    - d4-d5 wins the queen after exd5 (or Qe6), but let's check:
    - d4-d5 Qe7 (only move), then Nxd5+ wins more material.
2. e8f6+ Kg7
    - Nxd7 wins the queen.
3. e8f6+ Bxf6
    - d4-d5, opening the center, White is still up material.

**Calculation of e8d6+:**
1. e8d6+ Qxd6
    - White exchanges queens, up a rook.

**Calculation of e8g7:**
- Not forcing, loses the knight.

**Conclusion:**
The move **e8f6+** is the most forcing and wins material, possibly the queen.

**Final move:**
```
e8f6
```

2025-06-22 01:25:56,214 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.45s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (e6):**
- White: King on e1, Knight on f6, Rooks on a1, f1, Bishop on c1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e6, Queen on d7, Bishop on f8, Knight on b8, Rook on a8, pawns on a7, b6, g5

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White: up a piece (Knight for pawn)
- Black: King exposed, White's knight on f6 is very strong, Black's king is on e6 and cannot castle.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf6xg8**: Captures a rook, but knight may get trapped.
2. **Nf6xd7**: Captures the queen, but Black will recapture with the bishop or king.
3. **Nf6h7**: Attacks g5, but not very forcing.
4. **Nf6h5**: Attacks g7 and f4 squares, but not forcing.
5. **Nf6g4**: Checks the king, but Black can play Kf7 or Kd5.
6. **Nf6e4**: Checks the king, but Black can play Kd5 or Kf5.
7. **Nf6e8**: Retreat, not optimal.
8. **d4-d5+**: Pawn check, but Black can play Kf7 or Kf5.

**Critical lines:**
- **Nf6xd7**: If we take the queen, Black must recapture. Let's see:
    - 1. Nf6xd7 Bxd7 (or Kxd7)
    - White is up a piece, but loses the knight for the queen. Let's check if this is best.
- **Nf6xg8**: If we take the rook:
    - 1. Nf6xg8 Rxg8
    - White is up the exchange, but loses the knight.
- **d4-d5+**: Pawn check:
    - 1. d4-d5+ Kf7 (or Kf5)
    - If Kf7, then Nxd7 wins the queen.
    - If Kf5, then Qd3+ is not possible, but maybe g4+.
- **Nf6g4+**: Knight check:
    - 1. Nf6g4 Kf7 (or Kd5)
    - Not as forcing.

**Best move calculation:**
- **d4-d5+** looks very strong, as it forces the king to move and then Nxd7 wins the queen.
    - 1. d4-d5+ Kf7 (if Kf5, then g4+ is possible)
    - 2. Nxd7

But let's check if Black can avoid losing the queen:
- 1. d4-d5+ Kf7
- 2. Nxd7 Nxd7 (or Bxd7)
- White is up a piece.

Alternatively, **Nf6xd7** immediately:
- 1. Nxd7 Bxd7 (or Kxd7)
- White is up a piece.

But **d4-d5+** is more forcing and keeps initiative.

**Final Decision:**
- **d4-d5+** is the best move, as it forces the king to move and then Nxd7 wins the queen.

My move is:
```

2025-06-22 01:27:04,146 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.87s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (18... Kf6):**

- Black's king is on f6, exposed and unable to castle.
- Black's queen is on d7, bishop on f8, knight on b8, pawns on a7, b6, d6, g5, h7.
- White's king is on e1, rook on a1, bishop on c1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2.
- White to move.

**Key features:**
- Black's king is very exposed on f6.
- White has a significant lead in development and attacking potential.
- White can bring pieces into the attack quickly.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop development with tempo:** c1xg5 or c1f4, attacking the king and/or queen.
2. **Knight development:** g1f3, attacking the g5 pawn and threatening to bring more pieces into the attack.
3. **Pawn moves:** h2h4, g2g3, f2f4, but these are slower.
4. **Queenless kingside attack:** The king on f6 is very vulnerable.

**Tactical considerations:**
- If 1. Bxg5+, Black must block with Kg6 or Kf7, but then White can continue the attack.
- 1. Nf3 attacks the g5 pawn and threatens Nxg5+, but it's slower than a direct bishop check.

**Calculation:**
1. c1xg5+ Kf5 (only move, as Kg6 allows Qxg5# if queen was on h5, but here not possible)
   - Now, White can continue with Nf3, threatening g4# ideas.
   - Or, White can play Qd3+, but queen is not developed yet.

2. c1f4, attacking the queen and threatening Bxg5+ next.
   - If Black plays gxf4, then Qd4+ is a double attack on king and rook.

3. Nf3, attacking g5, but not as forcing.

**Best move:**
- Bxg5+ is the most forcing move, putting the king in check and opening lines.

**Check legality:**
- c1g5 is legal.

**Final move:**
```
c1g5
```

2025-06-22 01:28:25,867 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.00s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb2bnr/p2q1k2/1p1p4/3P2B1/8/8/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 1 19

- White to move.
- Black's king is on f7, exposed.
- Black's queen is on d7.
- Black's bishop is on b8.
- Black's knight is on b8 and g8.
- Black's pawns: a7, b6, d6, g7, h7.
- White's bishop is on g5, very active.
- White's king is on e1, can castle queenside.
- White's rook is on a1.
- White's knight is on g1.
- White's pawns: a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The Black king is on f7, unable to castle, and exposed.
- The bishop on g5 is eyeing the queen on d7 and the king on f7.
- White can consider castling queenside (e1c1), bringing the rook to d1 and increasing pressure on the d-file.
- Moves like g5h6 or g5e7 could check, but are easily parried.
- g5d8 attacks the queen and threatens to exchange, but that may relieve pressure.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e1c1 (castle queenside):** Brings the rook to d1, threatening Rd8, increasing pressure on the d-file, and keeping the king safe.
2. **g5h6:** Check, but Black simply plays g7xh6.
3. **g5e7:** Check, but Black can block with Nxe7 or Qxe7.
4. **g5d8:** Attacks the queen, but after Qxd8, White loses the strong bishop and relieves pressure.
5. **g1f3:** Develops a piece, but not urgent.
6. **h2h4:** Prepares h5, but not urgent.

**Deep analysis:**
- Castling queenside is very strong: it brings the rook to d1, threatens Rd8, and keeps the king safe.
- Black's king is stuck in the center/kingside, and White's rook will be very active.
- After e1c1, Black has no good way to defend d6 or the d-file.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to castle queenside, maximizing pressure and safety.

2025-06-22 01:29:21,738 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.29s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (Qh3):**

- White: King on c1, rook on d1, bishop on g5, knight on g1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on f7, rook on a8, bishop on c8, knight on b8, pawns on a7, b6, d6, queen on h3

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's queen is on h3, but there is no immediate mate threat.
- White's bishop on g5 is very active, and Black's king is exposed.
- White to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5d8**: Bishop takes rook with check. If ...Ke8, White can continue attacking.
2. **g5e7**: Bishop attacks the king, but f7 is covered.
3. **g5h6**: Bishop check, but king can move to g8.
4. **d1d4**: Defends the h4 pawn and prepares to swing the rook.
5. **g1h3**: Develops knight, but not urgent.

**Calculation:**
- **1. Bg5xd8+**: 
    - If ...Ke8, White can play Re1, threatening mate and winning more material.
    - If ...Kg8, White can continue with Re1, and Black is in trouble.
    - If ...Nd7, White can play Qf3+, and Black is lost.

**Let's check the main line:**
1. Bg5xd8+ Ke8 (forced)
2. Re1+ Kxd8 (if ...Be7, White can take on e7)
3. Nxh3, White is up a rook and has a winning position.

**Conclusion:** 
Taking the rook with check is the strongest move, winning material and keeping the initiative.

My move:
```
g5d8
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbB1b1r/p4k2/1p1p1n2/3P4/8/7q/PPP2PPP/2KR2NR w - - 5 21

White to move.

**Material:**
- White: Rook (d1), Rook (c1), Bishop (d8), Knight (g1), pawns
- Black: Rook (a8), Rook (h8), Bishop (f8), Knight (f6), Queen (h3), pawns

**King Safety:**
- White king on c1, relatively safe.
- Black king on f7, somewhat exposed.

**Threats:**
- Black's queen on h3 is menacing, but White's bishop on d8 is very powerful, pinning the knight on f6.
- White has a chance to increase pressure or win material.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **d8e7+**: Bishop check, forcing the king to move (since the knight is pinned).
2. **d8c7**: Bishop check, but less forcing.
3. **d8f6**: Captures the pinned knight, but Black can recapture with the queen.
4. **d8b6**: Bishop attacks b6 pawn, but not as forcing.
5. **d1d4**: Centralizes rook, but not urgent.
6. **g1h3**: Develops knight, but not urgent.

Let's analyze the most forcing move: **d8e7+**

- If ...Kxe7, then Re1+ wins the queen after ...Ne4 (forced), Rxe4+ Qe6 Rxe6+ Kxe6.
- If ...Kg6, then Nxh3, and White is up a piece.
- If ...Kg8, then Nxh3, White is up a piece.

**d8e7+** is a check, and the king must move because the knight is pinned.

**What about d8f6?**
- d8f6 Qg2 (threatening mate), but White can defend with Nf3. However, d8e7+ is more forcing.

**What about d8c7?**
- d8c7+ is also a check, but after ...Kg8, White doesn't gain as much.

**Conclusion:**
**d8e7+** is the strongest move, as it forces the king to move and wins material.

My move:
```
d8e7
```

2025-06-22 01:31:36,416 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.12s):
Let's analyze the position:

White:
- King on c1
- Rook on d1
- Bishop on e7
- Knight on g1
- Pawns: a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2

Black:
- King on f7
- Rook on a8
- Bishop on f8
- Knight on f6
- Queen on h4
- Pawns: a7, b6, d6

Material: White is up a bishop for a pawn.

Threats:
- Black's queen on h4 is menacing, but not immediately threatening mate.
- Black's king is exposed on f7.
- White's bishop on e7 is attacking f8 and can check on f8.
- White's rook on d1 is well placed.
- White's knight on g1 is undeveloped.

Candidate moves:
1. e7f8+ (Bxf8+): This checks the king. If ...Kxf8, White can develop rapidly and Black's king is exposed.
2. e7d8: Retreats bishop, but loses momentum.
3. e7f6: Bxf6 is a check, but ...Qxf6 and Black's queen is centralized.
4. d1d4: Defends h4, but not urgent.
5. Develop knight: g1f3 or g1e2.

Let's look at 1. e7f8+:
- If ...Kxf8, White can play Nf3, attacking the queen and developing.
- If ...Kg8, White can play Nf3, again with tempo.
- If ...Ke8, White can play Nf3, and Black's king is still exposed.

e7f8+ is forcing and puts Black on the defensive.

Let's check for tactics:
- After e7f8+ Kxf8, Nf3 attacks the queen, and if ...Qh6+, White can play Kb1, and the king is safe.
- Black's only threat is Qh6+ or Qg5+, but White can defend.

Therefore, the best move is the forcing check:

```
e7f8

2025-06-22 01:32:48,157 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.22s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb2B1r/p4k2/1p1p1n2/3P4/6q1/8/PPP2PPP/2KR2NR w - - 1 23

**White:** King on c1, Rook on d1, Bishop on f8, Knight on g1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on f7, Rook on a8, Bishop on c8, Knight on f6, pawns on a7, b6, d6, g4

**Black's last move:** ...Qg4

**Material:** White is up an exchange (Rook for Bishop), and has a dangerous Bishop on f8. Black's king is exposed, but White's king is fairly safe.

**Threats:**  
- Black threatens ...Qxg2, attacking the rook on h1 and possibly threatening mate if the knight moves.
- White has a bishop on f8, which can check on g7 or e7.
- White's rook on d1 can swing to the kingside or double up on the d-file.
- White's knight on g1 is undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f8g7+**: Bishop check. If ...Qxg7, White loses the bishop for nothing. If ...Kxg7, then White can develop, but loses the bishop.
2. **f8e7**: Bishop attacks the queen, but queen can just move.
3. **f8h6**: Bishop attacks the queen, but queen can just move.
4. **g1h3**: Develops the knight, covers g2, and threatens Ng5+.
5. **d1d4**: Rook attacks the queen, but queen can move.
6. **h2h3**: Kicks the queen, but ...Qxg2 is possible.
7. **f2f3**: Defends g2, but weakens the king.

**Critical calculation:**
- If 1. g1h3, then ...Qxg2, 2. Ng5+ Ke7 (or Kg8), 3. Rhg1 Qxg5+ 4. Rxg5 and White is winning.
- If 1. f8g7, Kxg7, 2. g1h3, Qxg2, 3. Ng5, Qxg5+, 4. Nxg5, White is up a piece, but Black has two pawns for it.

But let's check the most forcing move: **g1h3**.

1. g1h3 Qxg2
2. Ng5+ Ke7 (if Kg8, then Qxf6 is mate)
3. Rhg1 Qxg5+
4. Rxg5

White is up a rook and bishop for a queen, but Black's king is exposed.

Alternatively, after 1. g1h3, if Black doesn't take on g2, White can play Ng5+ next move, threatening mate.

**Is there a mate?**
- 1. g1h3 Qxg2 2. Ng5+ Ke7 3. Rhg1 Qxg5+ 4. Rxg5 and White is winning.

**Is there a better move?**
- 1. d1d4 Qxg2 2. g1h3 Qxg2 3. Ng5+ Ke7 4. Rhg1 Qxg5+ 5. Rxg5

No, the best is to develop the knight and threaten Ng5+.

**Final move:**
```
g1h3
```

2025-06-22 01:33:39,306 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.62s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb2B1r/5k2/1p1p1n2/p2P4/6q1/7N/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 0 24

White: King on c1, Rook on h1, Bishop on f8, Knight on h3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on f7, Rook on a8, Bishop on b8, Knight on f6, pawns on a5, b6, d6, g4, h7

Black's queen is missing, but Black has a material advantage in minor pieces and pawns. However, White's bishop on f8 is very strong, and Black's king is exposed.

**Immediate tactical threats:**
- Black's queen on g4 is menacing, but White's bishop on f8 covers g7 and h6.
- White's rook on h1 can swing to the g-file or f-file for pressure.
- White's knight on h3 can jump to g5 or f4, both attacking and defending.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h3g5**: Knight to g5, threatening checkmate on f7 (if the knight is not captured), but Black can play Kxf8 or Kg8.
2. **d1d4**: Centralizing the queen, attacking the queen on g4 and supporting the d5 pawn.
3. **h1g1**: Rook to g1, attacking the queen on g4.
4. **f8g7**: Bishop captures pawn on g7, but that is not possible as there is no pawn on g7.
5. **f8e7**: Bishop to e7, attacking the queen on g4.
6. **h3f4**: Knight to f4, attacking the queen and defending d5.

**Tactical calculation:**

- **h3g5**: If 1. Ng5+ Qxg5+ 2. Kb1 (or Kb2), but then Black can play Kxf8, and White loses the bishop.
- **h1g1**: 1. Rg1 Qf5 (retreat), but then White can play Ng5+.
- **d1d4**: 1. Qd4 Qg2, threatening mate on h1, but White can play Ng5+.
- **h3f4**: 1. Nf4 Qxf4+ (if possible), but the queen is not on f4.

**Best move:**

- **h1g1**: This move attacks the queen, forcing it to move, and prepares to double rooks or bring the knight to g5 with tempo. If the queen moves, White can play Ng5+ with a strong attack.

Therefore, after careful analysis, the best move is:

```
h1g1
```

**FEN:** rnb2B1r/5k2/1p1p1n2/p2P4/7q/7N/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 w - - 2 25

**White:** King on c1, Rooks on d1 and g1, Bishop on f8, Knight on h3, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on f7, Rook on h8, Bishop on c8, Knight on f6, Queen on h4, Pawns on a5, b6, d6

**Black threats:**
- Queen on h4 is menacing, especially with the knight on f6 and the rook on h8. Potential threats to g2 and h3.
- However, White's bishop on f8 is very powerful, controlling key squares and cutting off the king.

**White's options:**
- White is up material (an exchange and a pawn).
- The Black king is exposed.
- White's bishop on f8 is a monster, restricting Black's king.
- White's knight on h3 is awkward but can jump to g5 or f4.
- White's rook on g1 is on an open file, but currently blocked by the knight.

**Immediate tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate or a decisive attack?
- The Black king is on f7, with the bishop on c8 and knight on f6 as defenders.
- The queen on h4 is active but not directly threatening mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop moves:** f8-g7+ or f8-e7+ check, but both are covered by the knight on f6.
2. **Knight moves:** h3-g5+ check, but after Kg8, White has no immediate follow-up.
3. **Rook moves:** g1-g5, attacking the queen, but the queen can move.
4. **Centralization:** d1-d4, attacking the queen and gaining space.
5. **Pawn moves:** g2-g3, attacking the queen, but the queen can go to h6 or h5.

Let's analyze **h3-g5+**:
- 25. Ng5+ Ke7 (if Kg8, then Ne6 is a fork, but the king can go to e7)
- 26. Rde1+ Kd8 (if Kd7, then Re7+ is dangerous)
- But Black can defend.

What about **d1-d4** (attacking the queen)?
- 25. Rd4 Qh6+ (only check)
- 26. Kb1 (safe)
- Now, White threatens to double rooks on the g-file or play Rgd1.

What about **g2-g3**?
- 25. g3 Qh6+ (check)
- 26. Kb1 (safe)
- The queen is still active, but White is solid.

What about **f2-f3** (blocking the queen's access to g4)?
- 25. f3 Qh6+ (check)
- 26. Kb1 (safe)
- White is solid, and the queen is less active.

What about **Rook to g5**?
- 25. Rg5 Qh6 (forced)
- 26. Bxh6 Rxh6
- White is up material, but the attack is lessened.

What about **Rook to d4**?
- 25. Rd4 Qh6+ 26. Kb1

**Best move:**
- **Rd4** attacks the queen, gains space, and prepares to double rooks. The queen cannot stay on the h-file to threaten mate, and White can follow up with Rgd1 or Rf4.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d1d4
```

2025-06-22 01:36:07,149 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 10.01s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (10...Ne8):**
- White: King on c1, rook on d4 and g1, bishop on f8, knight on h3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on f7, rook on a8, knight on e8, bishop missing, pawns on a5, b6, d6, f7, g7, h4

**Material:**
- White is up the exchange (rook for knight) and has a dominating bishop on f8.
- Black's king is exposed on f7, and White's pieces are very active.
- Black's knight on e8 is passive, and the rook on a8 is not participating.

**Threats:**
- White threatens to invade on the kingside, especially with the rook on g1 and the bishop on f8.
- Black's h4 pawn is advanced but not immediately dangerous.
- Black's king is vulnerable to checks and mating nets.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rd4xh4**: Captures the h4 pawn, threatening to double rooks on the g-file and possibly Rh8#.
2. **Rd4f4+**: Immediate check, but Black can block with Nf6 or Kg8.
3. **Ng5+**: Knight jump with check, but f7 is covered by the king.
4. **Bf8xg7**: Captures the g7 pawn, threatening to open the g-file for the rook.
5. **Rd4g4**: Doubles on the g-file, threatening Rxg7+.

Let's calculate the most forcing lines:

**1. Rd4xh4**
- If Rxh4, White threatens Rh8# (mate in one if Black does nothing).
- Black can try Nf6, but then Rxh8, Rxh8, Bxg7, and White is up a full rook and pawn.

**2. Bf8xg7**
- If Bxg7, Black can play Nxg7, but then Rxg7+ Kf6, and White can continue the attack.
- If Black doesn't capture, White threatens Rxg7+.

**3. Rd4g4**
- Threatens Rxg7+.
- Black can try Nf6, but then Rxg7+ Kf8, and White can continue the attack.

**4. Rd4f4+**
- If Rd4f4+, Kg8 or Nf6, but White doesn't gain much.

**5. Ng5+**
- If Ng5+, Kg8, and White doesn't have a follow-up.

**Best move:**
- **Rxh4** is the most direct and threatens mate in one (Rh8#). Black has to defend against this, but after Nf6, White can play Rxh8, Rxh8, Bxg7, and White is completely winning.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d4h4
```

2025-06-22 01:36:51,621 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.80s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (10...Nd7):**
- White: King on c1, Rooks on g1 and h4, Bishop on f8, Knight on h3, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on f7, Rook on h8, Bishop on c8, Knight on d7, Pawns on a5, b6, d6

**Material count:**
- White is up an exchange (Rook for Knight) and has a powerful bishop on f8.
- Black's king is exposed on f7, and White's pieces are very active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bf8-g7**: Threatens mate on h8 and attacks the rook. If ...Rh4, then Ng5+ is devastating.
2. **Rh4-h8**: Immediate rook trade, but after Rxh8, White's bishop is still strong.
3. **Ng5+**: Not possible immediately, as the knight is on h3.
4. **Rh4-f4+**: King goes to g8 or e8, but doesn't seem decisive.
5. **Rh4-h6**: Threatens mate on g7, but Black can defend with Nf8.
6. **Bf8-e7**: Attacks the rook, but not as forcing.

**Critical lines:**
- **Bf8-g7**: If Black plays Rxh4, then Ng5+ is crushing (Kg8, Ne6, etc.).
- **Bf8-g7**: If Black plays Rg8, then Ng5+ is still strong.
- **Bf8-g7**: If Black plays Re8, then Ng5+ is still strong.

**Tactical check:**
- After Bf8-g7, Black cannot stop Ng5+ without losing material or getting mated.

**Conclusion:**
The move **Bf8-g7** is the most forcing, threatens mate, and leaves Black with no good defense.

My move:

2025-06-22 01:37:36,942 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.40s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on c1, rook on h4, rook on g1, knight on h3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on g7, rook on a8, knight on e8, knight on d7, pawns on a5, b6, d6

**Material:**
- White: 2 rooks, knight, 7 pawns
- Black: 2 rooks, 2 knights, 3 pawns

**Key features:**
- White is up significant material (White has 7 pawns vs Black's 3, and White has two rooks vs Black's rook and two knights).
- Black's king is exposed on g7.
- White's rook on h4 is very active and can invade the 7th or 8th rank.
- Black's knights are passive and not coordinated for defense.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h4h8**: Rook to h8, check. If ...Kf7, then Rh7+ wins more material.
2. **h4h7**: Rook to h7+, check. If ...Kf8, then Rh8# is mate.
3. **h4h6**: Rook to h6, not a check, but attacks the d6 pawn.
4. **h3g5**: Knight to g5, attacks the king, but not a check.
5. **Other rook moves**: Not as forcing as the above.

**Let's calculate h4h7+ (Rook to h7, check):**
- If ...Kf8, then Rh8# is checkmate.
- If ...Kg8, then Rh8# is checkmate.
- If ...Kg6, then Qh6# (but we don't have a queen).
- If ...Kf6, not possible.

**So, after h4h7+**
- ...Kf8: Rh8# (mate)
- ...Kg8: Rh8# (mate)
- ...Kf7: Rh8, and Black must block with Nf8, then Rxh8, winning everything.

**Therefore, h4h7 is a forced win.**

**Final move:**
```
h4h7
```

2025-06-22 01:38:36,879 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.40s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on c1, rook on g1, rook on h7, knight on h3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on f6, rook on a8, bishop on c8, knight on e8, knight on d7, pawns on a5, b6, d6

**White to move.**

**Tactical considerations:**
- Black's king is on f6, surrounded by its own pieces and somewhat exposed.
- White's rook on h7 is very active, and the knight on h3 can jump to g5 or f4 with check.
- Black's knight on e8 and d7 are passive, and the bishop on c8 is undeveloped.
- White's rook on g1 can swing to the kingside if needed.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h7h8: Rook to h8, but Black can block with knight or bishop.
2. h7g7: Rook to g7, attacking the king and possibly threatening g5+.
3. h3g5: Knight to g5+, check. If king moves, rook can invade.
4. h3f4: Knight to f4+, check. If king moves, rook can invade.
5. h7d7: Rook takes knight on d7, but then rook is captured by bishop or knight.

Let's analyze the checks first:

**1. h3g5+**
- If Kxg5, then h7xd7 wins a piece.
- If Kf5, then Qf3+ (but no queen), or rook can swing.
- If Ke5, then f4+ is possible.

But after h3g5+, Black can play:
- Kxg5 (but then h7xd7, White wins a piece)
- Ke5 (then f4+ is a fork)
- Kg6 (then h7xd7, again White wins a piece)

**2. h3f4+**
- If Kf5, then g4+ is possible.
- If Ke5, then f4+ is a fork.
- If Kg7, then h7xd7.

But h3g5+ seems more forcing.

**3. h7g7**
- Rook to g7, attacking the king, but not a check.

**4. h7d7**
- Rook takes knight, but then bishop takes rook.

**5. h7h8**
- Rook to h8, but not a check.

**Best move:**
The most forcing move is h3g5+, as it gives check and threatens to win material.

Let's check the lines after h3g5+:

- If Kxg5, then h7xd7, White wins a piece.
- If Ke5, then f4+ forks king and knight.
- If Kg6, then h7xd7.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h3g5
```

2025-06-22 01:39:13,930 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.71s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (…Ne5):**
- White: King on c1, rook on g1 and h7, knight on g5 and e5, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on f6, rook on a8, bishop on c8, knight on e8, pawns on a5, b6, d6, e5.

**Material:**
- White: 2 rooks, 2 knights, 8 pawns
- Black: rook, bishop, knight, 5 pawns

**Tactical considerations:**
- White is up a rook and a knight for a bishop and two pawns.
- Black's king is exposed on f6.
- White's rook on h7 is very active, and the knight on g5 is menacing.

**Immediate threats:**
- White can play Rf7# (h7f7), which is checkmate because the Black king on f6 has no escape squares:
  - g7, g6, e6, e7, f5, f7 are all covered by White's pieces or pawns.
  - The knight on g5 covers e6 and f7.
  - The rook on g1 covers the g-file.
  - The rook on h7 can go to f7 for mate.

**Verification:**
- After h7f7, Black's king on f6 is in check.
- The only possible block is with the knight on e8, but it cannot block f7.
- No Black piece can capture on f7 or block the check.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h7f7

2025-06-22 01:39:59,793 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.04s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (31...Kf6):**

- White: King on c1, rook on g1, knight on g5, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on f6, knight on f7, bishop on c8, rook on a8, pawns on a5, b6, d6

**Material:**
- White: Rook, knight, 7 pawns
- Black: Rook, bishop, knight, 5 pawns

**Tactical and strategic considerations:**
- White is up a pawn, but Black has the bishop pair.
- Black's king is exposed on f6.
- White's knight on g5 is very active, and there are checks available.
- White's rook on g1 is well placed for a kingside attack.
- Black's pieces are somewhat passive, especially the bishop on c8 and rook on a8.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5h7** (Ng7+): Knight check, forcing the king to move.
2. **g5f7** (Nxf7): Capture the knight on f7, but after Kxf7, the king is less exposed.
3. **g5e6** (Ne6): Forking the king and bishop, but the king can capture on e6.
4. **g5e4** (Ne4+): Check, but the king can go to f5 or e7.
5. **g1e1** (Rg1-e1): Centralizing the rook, but not urgent.
6. **g1h1** (Rg1-h1): Not relevant.
7. **Other pawn moves:** Not urgent.

**Deep calculation:**

Let's look at the check first:

1. **Ng7+ (g5h7):**
   - If Kxg7, White can play d6-d7, threatening d8=Q.
   - If Ke7, White can play d6-d7, again threatening d8=Q.

But after Ng7+, Black must play Kxg7 (since the only other legal move is Ke7, but then d6-d7 is strong).

After Ng7+ Kxg7:
- White can play d6-d7, threatening d8=Q.
- Black can play Bxd7, but then Nxd7, and White is up material.

Alternatively, after Ng7+ Kxg7, White can play Ne6+ forking the king and bishop.

Let's check the sequence:
1. Ng7+ Kxg7
2. Ne6+ Bxe6 (forced, otherwise White wins the bishop)
3. dxe6 (pawn now on e6, threatening e7 and e8=Q)
   - Black's king is cut off from the e-file, and White's pawn is very strong.

Alternatively, after Ng7+ Kxg7, White can play d6-d7, but Black can play Bxd7, and after Nxd7, White is up a piece.

**Let's check if there is a forced mate:**
- After Ng7+ Kxg7, Ne6+ Bxe6, dxe6, Black is in trouble, but not immediately mated.

**What about Nxf7?**
- Nxf7 Kxf7, White loses the knight for a knight, not as strong.

**Conclusion:**
- Ng7+ is the strongest move, as it forces Black's king to a vulnerable position and allows White to push the d-pawn or win material.

**Final move:**
```
g5h7
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on c1, rook on g1, knight on h7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e7, knight on e8, rook on a8, bishop on c8, pawns on a5, b6, d6

**Material:**
- White: Rook, knight, 8 pawns
- Black: Rook, bishop, knight, 5 pawns

**Key features:**
- White's knight on h7 is very active and can fork or check.
- Black's king is on e7, somewhat exposed.
- Black's knight on e8 is awkwardly placed.
- White's rook is on g1, ready to swing.
- White has a passed pawn on d5, supported by the king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h7f8+**: Knight check, forking king and rook.
   - If ...Kxf8, White wins the exchange.
   - If ...Kf7, White can continue with Ne6.
2. **h7f6**: Knight attacks the d7 square, but not a check.
3. **h7g5**: Retreat, not active.
4. **g1h1**: Rook swing, but not urgent.
5. **c1d2**: King move, not urgent.

**Analysis of h7f8+:**
- 32. Nh7-f8+ Kxf8 (forced, otherwise lose rook)
- White wins the exchange: rook for knight.
- After that, White is up a rook for a knight, with a passed pawn and active rook.

**Is there any better move?**
- No immediate mate, but h7f8+ wins material and keeps initiative.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
h7f8
```

- Black: King on e7, rook on a7, bishop on c8, knight on e8, pawns on a5, b6, d6

**Material:**
- White: Rook, knight, 7 pawns
- Black: Rook, bishop, knight, 4 pawns

**Key points:**
- White's knight on f8 is very strong, attacking e6 and g6, and controlling key squares.
- Black's king is exposed on e7.
- Black's rook is on a7, bishop on c8, knight on e8 (passive).
- White's rook is on g1, potentially able to swing to the kingside or central files.
- White is up material (extra pawns), and Black's pieces are awkwardly placed.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f8g6+** (not legal, as g6 is not a legal move for the knight)
2. **f8e6** (knight attacks Black's king and bishop, but the king can move)
3. **f8d7** (knight check, king can move)
4. **f8h7** (knight attacks rook, but rook is defended by bishop)
5. **g1e1** (rook to open file, pressure on e8 knight)
6. **g1d1** (rook to d-file, pressure on d6 pawn)
7. **c1d1** (king centralizes)
8. **h2h4** (pawn push, but not urgent)

**Tactical considerations:**
- The knight on f8 can check on d7 or e6.
- f8e6+ attacks the king and bishop, but after Kf7, the bishop is still defended.
- f8d7+ forces the king to f7 or d8.
- The rook on g1 can swing to e1, pinning the knight on e8 to the king.

**Deep calculation:**
- f8d7+ Kf7 (if Kxd7, then Nxa7 wins the rook)
- f8d7+ Kf7, now what? Rook to e1 pins the knight, but Black can defend.
- f8e6+ Kf7, again, rook to e1 is strong.

But let's check if f8d7+ wins material:
- f8d7+ Kxd7 (if king takes), then Nxa7 wins the rook.
- If f8d7+ Kf7, then rook to e1, threatening Re7+.

**Best move:**
- f8d7+ is a forcing move, and if Kxd7, White wins the rook on a7. If Kf7, White can play Re1, increasing pressure.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8d7
```

2025-06-22 01:43:13,352 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.29s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on c1, rook on g1, knight on d7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e8, rook on a7, bishop on c8, knight on e8 and g4, pawns on a5, b6, d6

**Material:**
- White: Rook, knight, 7 pawns
- Black: Rook, bishop, 2 knights, 3 pawns

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's knights are active, but White's knight on d7 is very strong, controlling key squares.
- Black's king is stuck on e8, unable to castle and boxed in by its own pieces.
- White's rook on g1 is ready to swing.
- White's king is relatively safe on c1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d7f6+ (Check, but g4 knight covers f6)
2. d7b8+ (Check, but a7 rook covers b8)
3. d7e5 (Centralizes knight, but doesn't threaten much)
4. g1e1 (Rook to open file, pressure e8)
5. g1d1 (Rook to d-file, pressure d6 pawn)
6. c2c4 (Undermines d6 pawn, but not urgent)
7. h2h3 (Kicks knight, but not urgent)
8. f2f4 (Kicks knight, but weakens king)
9. c1d1 (King to safety, but not urgent)

**Key tactical ideas:**
- The Black king is boxed in and cannot move.
- The Black bishop on c8 is undeveloped.
- White's knight on d7 controls e5, f6, b6, c5, and b8.
- White's rook can swing to the open e-file or d-file.

**Critical calculation:**
- If White plays g1e1, threatening Nf6+ or Re8+, Black has trouble defending.
- If White plays d7f6+, Black plays Nxf6, but then Re1+ is strong.
- If White plays g1d1, targeting d6, but Black can defend with Bxd7.

**Best move:**
- g1e1 is very strong, threatening Re8+ and using the pin on the e-file.

**Double-check:**
- After g1e1, if Black plays Bxd7, White plays Nf6+ and wins material.
- If Black plays Rxd7, White plays Nf6+ and wins the exchange.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g1e1
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2b1n2r/r2Nk3/1p1p4/p2P4/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/2K1R3 w - - 8 35

White: King on c1, Rook on e1, Knight on d7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on g8, Rook on a7, Bishop on c8, Knight on e4, Knight on e7, pawns on a5, b6, d6

**Material:**  
White: Rook, Knight, 7 pawns  
Black: Rook, Bishop, 2 Knights, 3 pawns

**Positional factors:**  
- White's knight on d7 is very strong, attacking b6 and f8, and controlling key squares.
- Black's bishop on c8 is passive.
- Black's knight on e4 is centralized and strong.
- Black's rook on a7 is active.
- White's king is relatively safe on c1.
- White's rook on e1 is active and can swing to the kingside or support the center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d7f8 (Knight to f8, forking rook and bishop)
2. d7b8 (Knight to b8, not threatening much)
3. d7f6 (Knight to f6+, check, but g7 is covered)
4. d7b6 (Knight to b6, attacking a8 and d7, but b6 is protected)
5. d7e5 (Knight to e5, attacking c6 and g6)
6. d7c5 (Knight to c5, attacking b3 and e4)
7. e1e4 (Rook to e4, attacking knight on e4)
8. e1e3, e1e2, e1h1, e1g1, e1f1, e1d1 (rook moves, but not threatening)
9. c1d1, c1b1 (king moves, not urgent)
10. Pawn moves (not urgent)

**Tactical considerations:**
- d7f8 attacks the rook on a7 and bishop on c8. After ...Kxf8, White can play Re8+.
- d7f6+ is a check, but after ...Nxf6, White loses the knight.
- e1e4 attacks the knight on e4, but Black can defend with ...Bf5 or ...Nf6.

**Best move calculation:**
- d7f8 is a fork, attacking both the rook and bishop. If Black plays ...Kxf8, White can play Re8+ and win the knight on e7.
- After d7f8, if Black plays ...Kxf8, then Re8+ Nxe8, Rxe8+ Kf7, Rxc8. White wins material.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play the fork with the knight:

```
d7f8
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4nN1r/r3k3/1p1p4/p2P4/4n1b1/8/PPP2PPP/2K1R3 w - - 10 36

White: King on c1, Rook on e1, Knight on f8, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on e7, Rook on a7, Knight on e4, Bishop on g4, pawns on a5, b6, d6

**Key features:**
- White is up the exchange (Rook for minor piece).
- Black has a dangerous knight on e4 and a bishop on g4.
- White's knight on f8 is very strong, controlling key squares and threatening to invade.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on e7.
- White's king is relatively safe on c1.
- White has a rook on e1, ready to swing.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f8h7** (Knight to h7): Attacks the rook on a7, but the rook can move.
2. **f8d7** (Knight to d7): Forks the king and rook! This is a classic fork.
3. **f8g6** (Knight to g6): Attacks the bishop, but not as forcing.
4. **f8e6** (Knight to e6): Forks king and bishop, but the bishop is defended by the king.
5. **e1e4** (Rook to e4): Attacks the knight, but not as forcing as the knight fork.
6. Other rook moves: Not as forcing.

**Let's calculate f8d7:**
- f8d7 attacks both the king on e7 and the rook on a7.
- Black must move the king (only legal squares: d8, f7, f8).
- After king moves, White can capture the rook on a7, going up a full rook for a minor piece.

**Is there any counterplay for Black?**
- After f8d7+, Kd8, Nxa7, Black can try ...Nxf2, but White's king is safe and can defend.
- White will be up a rook for a minor piece, which is a decisive material advantage.

**Conclusion:**  
The move **f8d7** is a classic fork, wins material, and is the best move.

My move:
```
f8d7
```

2025-06-22 01:45:23,735 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.54s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on c1, Rook on e1, Knight on d7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on e8, Rook on a7, Bishop on g4, Knight on e4, pawns on a4, b6, d6

**Key features:**
- White's knight on d7 is very strong, controlling key squares and limiting Black's king.
- Black's pieces are active, especially the knight on e4 and bishop on g4.
- White's rook on e1 is well placed, but could be more active.
- Black threatens ...Kxd7 if the knight moves.
- Black's a-pawn is advanced and could become dangerous in the endgame.
- White's king is relatively safe for now.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d7f6** (Knight to f6): Attacks the bishop on g4, but Black can respond with Nxf6, exchanging knights and relieving some pressure.
2. **e1e4** (Rook to e4): Attacks the knight on e4, but Black can respond with Bxd7, winning the knight.
3. **e1e3** (Rook to e3): Prepares to swing the rook to the kingside or third rank, but doesn't pose an immediate threat.
4. **h2h3** (Pawn to h3): Attacks the bishop, but Black can play Bxd7, again winning the knight.
5. **c2c4** (Pawn to c4): Attacks the knight on e4, but Black can play Rxd7, winning the knight.
6. **d7b6** (Knight to b6): Attacks the rook on a7 and pawn on a4. If Rb7, then Nc4, attacking b6 and d6. This looks promising.

**Deeper look at d7b6:**
- d7b6 attacks the rook on a7 and the pawn on a4.
- If Black plays Rb7, then Nc4 attacks b6 and d6.
- If Black plays Rxd7, White loses the knight for a rook, but gets a rook for a knight, which is a good trade.
- If Black plays a3, White can play b3, and the pawn is blockaded.

**Deeper look at d7f8:**
- d7f8 attacks the rook on a7, but after Kxf8, White loses the knight.

**Deeper look at d7e5:**
- d7e5 attacks the knight on e4, but Black can play dxe5, and White loses the knight.

**Deeper look at e1e2:**
- e1e2 defends the knight, but is passive.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is **d7b6**, attacking the rook and threatening to win material or at least force Black to react defensively.

My move:
```
d7b6

2025-06-22 01:46:04,893 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.44s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (c1), Rook (e1), Knight (b6), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: King (e7), Rook (a7), Rook (h3), Knight (e4), Bishop (g4), pawns (a4, d6), h3 is a rook, not a pawn.

**Key features:**
- Black has two rooks, a knight, and a bishop for White's rook and knight. Black is up the exchange (two rooks vs rook and knight), but White has a strong knight on b6 and a passed pawn on d5.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on e7.
- White's rook is on e1, ready to activate.
- Black's bishop on g4 and knight on e4 are centralized and dangerous.
- Black's rook on h3 is very active, possibly threatening to swing to h1 or h2.
- White's knight on b6 attacks a8 and c8, and can jump to c8 or a4.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b6c8**: Knight to c8, attacking the rook on a7 and threatening to fork king and rook with Nc6+ if the king moves.
2. **b6a4**: Knight to a4, attacking the bishop on g4 and the pawn on b2.
3. **e1e4**: Rook to e4, attacking the knight on e4 and possibly threatening to double on the e-file.
4. **e1e3**: Rook to e3, defending the third rank and possibly preparing to challenge the h3 rook.
5. **f2f3**: Attacking the knight on e4, but this weakens the king and doesn't seem urgent.
6. **g2h3**: Capturing the rook on h3, but the bishop on g4 covers h3, so this is illegal.

**Tactical considerations:**
- The knight on b6 is well-placed and can attack the rook on a7 with Nc8.
- The rook on e1 can swing to e4 to attack the knight on e4.
- Black's threats: ...Rh1 or ...Rh2, possibly attacking the second rank or threatening mate if the rook gets to h1 and the king is forced to b2.

**Deeper look at b6c8:**
- b6c8 attacks the rook on a7. If Black plays ...Bxc8, White loses the knight for a bishop, but the bishop is a strong piece.
- If Black moves the rook, White can consider playing Nc6+ if the king moves, but currently, the king is on e7.
- After b6c8, if Black plays ...Rc7, White can play Nxe7, forking king and rook, but the king is on e7, so that's not possible.

**Deeper look at e1e4:**
- e1e4 attacks the knight on e4. If Black plays ...Bf5, defending the knight, White can consider f3, attacking the knight again.
- e1e4 also covers the fourth rank, possibly preparing to swing to h4 to challenge the rook.

**Deeper look at e1e3:**
- e1e3 covers the third rank, defending against Rh3-h1 or h2. But Black can play ...Rh1+ anyway, and after Kd2, ...Rd1+ is not possible because the rook is on a7.

**Deeper look at b6a4:**
- b6a4 attacks the bishop on g4, but the bishop is defended by the knight on e4.

**Deeper look at c1b1:**
- King to b1, tucking away, but doesn't address the threats.

**Deeper look at f2f3:**
- f3 attacks the knight, but after ...Bf5, the knight is defended.

**Best move:**
- The most active move is **e1e4**, attacking the knight on e4 and preparing to challenge the h3 rook with Rh4 if needed. It also keeps the rook active and central. The knight on b6 is well-placed and can jump to c8 or a4 if needed.

Therefore, my move is:
```
e1e4
```

2025-06-22 01:46:39,323 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.66s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3kn3/r7/1N1p4/3P4/p3R1b1/7r/PPP2PPP/2K5 w - - 1 39

**White:** Kc1, Nb6, Re4, pawns a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** Ke8, Ra7, Bg4, pawns a4, d6, h3

**Key points:**
- Black's king is on e8, with a rook on a7, bishop on g4, and a dangerous passed pawn on h3.
- White's knight on b6 is very strong, controlling key squares.
- White's rook on e4 is active.
- White has a pawn majority on the queenside and central passed pawn on d5.
- Black's rook on a7 is not very active, and the bishop on g4 is somewhat menacing but not immediately threatening.
- Black's h3 pawn is advanced, but White can play g2-g3 to block it if needed.

**Immediate tactics:**
- White can consider b6-c8+ to check the king, but after Kd8, the knight is somewhat awkward.
- White can consider e4xg4, but that's not a legal move (bishop is on g4, rook is on e4).
- White can consider e4xe8+ to win the exchange, but the rook on a7 will recapture.
- White can consider e4e8+, forcing Rxe8, then Nxa4, but that seems slow.
- White can consider e4e7+, but after Kf8, there is no immediate follow-up.
- White can consider c2-c4, but that doesn't seem urgent.
- White can consider b2-b3 or a2-a3 to undermine the a4 pawn.

**Critical candidate moves:**
1. **e4e8+**: Forces Rxe8, then White can play Nxa4, winning a pawn and simplifying.
2. **b6c8+**: Forces Kd8, but then what? The knight is awkward on c8.
3. **e4e7+**: Forces Kf8, but then what? No immediate follow-up.
4. **Nxa4**: Wins a pawn, but leaves the knight on the rim.
5. **g2g3**: Stops h2-h1=Q, but not urgent as h2 is not possible.
6. **c2c4**: Undermines d6, but not urgent.

**Deep analysis of e4e8+:**
- e4e8+ Rxe8
- Nxa4 (wins a pawn, attacks bishop)
- If ...h2, then g2-g3, and White is safe.
- If ...Bd7, White can play Nb6, and the knight is safe.
- White is up a pawn and has a strong knight vs bishop in an open position.

**Deep analysis of b6c8+:**
- b6c8+ Kd8
- Now what? The knight is awkward, and White loses momentum.

**Deep analysis of e4e7+:**
- e4e7+ Kf8
- No immediate follow-up.

**Deep analysis of Nxa4:**
- Nxa4, but then ...hxg2, and White must be careful.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is **e4e8+**, forcing a rook trade and simplifying to a winning endgame with an extra pawn and a strong knight.

My move:
```
e4e8
```

2025-06-22 01:47:08,559 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 14.54s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on c1, Rook on e8, Knight on b6, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on c7, Rook on a7, Bishop on g4, Rook on h3, pawn on d6, a4

**White to move.**

**Immediate tactical checks:**
- White's rook on e8 is very active, and the knight on b6 is close to the black king.
- Black's king is on c7, with a rook on a7 and a bishop on g4. Black's rook on h3 is far from the action.
- The pawn on d5 is strong, restricting Black's king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e8c8+** (Rook check): King must move, but c8 is covered by the knight. Only legal move is Kxb6, but that's not possible. So, not a checkmate.
2. **e8e1** (Rook swing): Not threatening anything immediate.
3. **b6c8+** (Knight check): King must move to b8 or b7.
4. **e8e7** (Rook to 7th): Attacks bishop, but not forcing.
5. **e8h8** (Rook swing): Not threatening anything immediate.

**Let's check the most forcing moves:**

### 1. Rook checks:
- **e8c8+**: Black's only legal move is Kxb6, but that's not possible (rook is not protected). So, not a checkmate.
- **b6c8+**: Knight check. Black's king can go to b8 or b7.
    - If Kb8, then Re8-e8 is not a check, but the king is on the edge.
    - If Kb7, then Re8-e7+ is possible, but Black can block with the bishop.

### 2. Rook captures:
- No immediate captures.

### 3. Knight moves:
- **b6c8+**: As above.

### 4. Rook to e7:
- **e8e7**: Attacks bishop, but bishop can move.

### 5. Pawn moves:
- Not urgent.

### 6. Rook swing:
- **e8h8**: Not threatening anything.

### 7. Rook to c8:
- **e8c8+**: Let's check this again.
    - Black's only legal move is Kxb6 (illegal), so not possible.

### 8. Knight to c4:
- **b6c4**: Not threatening anything.

### 9. Knight to d7:
- **b6d7**: Not threatening anything.

### 10. Knight to a4:
- **b6a4**: Not threatening anything.

### 11. Knight to a8:
- **b6a8**: Not threatening anything.

### 12. Rook to 8th rank:
- **e8a8**: Not threatening anything.

### 13. Rook to b8:
- **e8b8**: Not threatening anything.

### 14. Rook to d8:
- **e8d8**: Not threatening anything.

### 15. Rook to f8:

### 17. Rook to h8:

### 18. Rook to e7:
- **e8e7**: Attacks bishop on g4, but not forcing.

### 19. Rook to e6:
- **e8e6**: Not threatening anything.

### 20. Rook to e5:
- **e8e5**: Not threatening anything.

### 21. Rook to e4:

## Most Forcing Move: Knight Check

**b6c8+** is the most forcing move. Let's see what happens:

- 1. Nc8+ Kb8 (only move)
- Now, Re8-e8 is not a check, but the king is on the edge.
- If 1... Kb7, then Re8-e7+ is possible, but Black can block with the bishop.

2025-06-22 01:47:29,115 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.70s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2N1R3/r1k5/3p4/3P1b2/p7/7r/PPP2PPP/2K5 w - - 3 41

White: King on c1, Rook on e8, Knight on c8, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on c7, Rook on a7, Rook on h3, Bishop on f5, pawns on a4, d6

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Knight, 7 pawns
- Black: 2 Rooks, Bishop, 2 pawns

**Key points:**
- White's rook is on e8, threatening back rank ideas.
- White's knight on c8 is attacking a7 and d6.
- Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed.
- Black's rook on h3 is far from the action.
- Black's bishop on f5 is active, but not attacking anything immediate.
- Black's pawn on d6 is weak.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e8h8**: Rook to h8, attacking the rook on h3.
2. **c8e7**: Knight to e7+, check, forking king and rook.
3. **c8a7**: Knight takes rook on a7.
4. **c8d6**: Knight takes pawn on d6, check.
5. **c8b6**: Knight to b6, check.
6. **c1d2**: King move, but not urgent.

Let's analyze the most forcing moves:

### 1. c8a7 (Knight takes rook)
- c8a7, King must move (only legal is b8 or d8).
- After c8a7, White wins a rook for a knight, gaining material.

### 2. c8e7+ (Knight check)
- c8e7+, King must move (d7 or b6).
- If Kd7, then Nxf5, winning a bishop.
- If Kb6, then Nxf5, again winning a bishop.

### 3. c8d6+ (Knight check)
- c8d6+, King must move (d6 is protected by bishop, so only Kb6 or d7).
- After Kb6, Nxf5, again winning a bishop.

### 4. e8h8 (Rook to h8)
- Threatens to exchange rooks, but not as forcing as the knight moves.

### 5. c8b6+ (Knight check)
- c8b6+, King must move (b6 is occupied, so only d8 or b8).
- Not as forcing as the others.

**Best move:**
- c8a7 wins a rook outright.
- c8e7+ wins a bishop after check, but c8a7 is more direct and wins more material.

**Check for tactics:**
- After c8a7, Black cannot recapture, and White is up a rook for a knight.
- No immediate counterplay for Black.

**Final move:**
```
c8a7
```

2025-06-22 01:47:53,476 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.91s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (e8), Knight (a7), King (c1), 7 pawns
- Black: Rook (h7), Bishop (f5), King (c7), 4 pawns (d6, a4, f5, h7)

**Positional factors:**
- White's rook is very active on the 8th rank.
- White's knight is on a7, attacking c6 and b5 squares.
- Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed.
- Black's rook is on h7, not very active.
- Black's bishop is on f5, controlling some central squares.
- Black has a passed pawn on a4, but it's not immediately dangerous.
- White's king is safe on c1.

**Immediate tactics:**
- White's rook can check on e7, but that's not a legal move.
- White's rook can swing to the h-file (e8h8), threatening the rook on h7.
- If 1. Re8-h8 Rxh8 2. Nc6, White threatens to win the bishop on f5, but Black can play Rh2 or Rh6.
- Alternatively, White can play Nc6, forking the king and bishop, but that's not a legal move from a7.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Re8-h8: Attacks the rook on h7, forces a trade or a retreat.
2. Nc6: Not legal.
3. c2-c4: Undermines Black's a4 pawn.
4. King moves: Not urgent.
5. Pawn moves: Not urgent.

**Calculation of 1. Re8-h8:**
- 1. Re8-h8 Rxh8 (forced)
- 2. Nc6 (forks king and bishop)
- 2... Kb6 (only move)
- 3. Rxh8 (White wins the exchange, rook for rook, but Black's bishop is still on f5)
- But after 2. Nc6, Black's king is forced to b6, and White can play Rxh8, and the knight is very strong.

**Alternative:**
- 1. Re8-e7+ Kd8 2. Nc6+ Kc8 3. Rxh7, but Black's king can escape.

**Best move:**
1. Re8-h8 is the most forcing and wins material.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e8h8
```

2025-06-22 01:48:14,322 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.97s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 7R/N1k5/3p4/3P1b1r/p7/8/PPP2PPP/2K5 w - - 3 43

**White:** King on c1, rook on h8, knight on a7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on c7, rook on h5, bishop on f5, pawn on a4, d6

**Material:**
- White: Rook, knight, 6 pawns
- Black: Rook, bishop, 2 pawns

**Key points:**
- White's rook is on h8, Black's king is on c7, so no immediate back-rank mate.
- White's knight is on a7, not doing much but can jump to c6 or b5.
- Black's rook is on h5, bishop on f5, both active.
- Black's pawn on a4 is advanced, but not immediately threatening.
- White's king is safe on c1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h8h5 (trade rooks, but Black recaptures with bishop, which is not ideal)
2. h8h6 (attack the rook, but Black can play Rxh6)
3. h8h7 (defend d7 square, but not much impact)
4. h8g8/h8f8/h8e8/h8d8/h8c8/h8b8/h8a8 (swing rook to open file, but not much impact)
5. a7c6+ (knight check, but Black king can go to b6 or d7)
6. a7b5 (knight closer to action)
7. c1d2 (improve king)
8. h2h3 (give luft, but not urgent)
9. c2c4 (try to open lines, but d6 pawn is protected)
10. f2f3 (prepare g4, but not urgent)

**Tactical checks:**
- a7c6+ is a forcing move. Let's check: 1. Na7-c6+ Kc7-b6 (only move), then what? Knight is attacked by pawn, but can go to d4 or e7. Not much follow-up.
- h8h5 Rxh5, knight can go to b5+ but then king moves, and White has no immediate threats.

**Strategic plan:**
- White is up material (knight for two pawns), but Black's bishop and rook are active.
- Trading rooks is not ideal unless it leads to a clear win.
- Improving the knight's position is key.

**Best move:**
- a7b5+ is a check, forcing the king to move. After Kb6, knight can go to d4, attacking bishop and supporting c6.
- Alternatively, a7c6+ is a check, but after Kb6, knight is attacked by pawn, so not ideal.
- a7b5+ is better, as it keeps the knight active and attacks the king.

**Final move:**
```
a7b5
```

2025-06-22 01:48:34,095 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.43s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (h8), Knight (b5), pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2, King (c1)
- Black: Rook (h5), Bishop (f5), pawns on a4, d6, King (b7)

**Position:**
- White is up a knight for a pawn.
- Black's king is on b7, somewhat exposed.
- White's rook is on h8, knight on b5, king on c1.
- Black's rook is on h5, bishop on f5.
- White's knight on b5 is attacking d6 and a7 squares.
- Black's bishop on f5 is well-placed, but not attacking anything immediate.
- Black's rook on h5 is not threatening anything immediate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rook moves: h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8, h8h7, h8h6, h8h5
- Knight moves: b5c7, b5a7, b5d6, b5d4, b5c3, b5a3
- King moves: c1d2, c1d1, c1b1
- Pawn moves: h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4, b2b4

**Tactical considerations:**
- Is there a way to win material or deliver checkmate?
- Is there a way to press the advantage?

**Immediate threats:**
- Black has no immediate threats.
- White's knight can jump to d6 with check, but the king can move to a6 or b6.
- Rook can swing to the 8th rank to cut off the king.

**Critical candidate:**
- b5xd6+ (knight check): King can go to a6 or b6.
- h8a8: Threatens to invade the 8th rank and possibly attack a4 pawn.
- h8b8: Threatens b7 king, but not a check.
- h8c8: Threatens c7 knight fork.
- h8d8: Threatens d6 pawn.
- h8e8: Not much.
- h8h7: Not much.
- h8h5: Trades rooks, but we are up material, so trading is good.

**Deeper calculation:**
- b5xd6+ Kb6 (or Ka6), then Nc4+ (if Kb6), but then Kc7.
- h8h5 Rxh5, Nxd6+ Kc7, Nxf5, Rxf5, White is up a pawn in a rook endgame.
- h8b8+ Kxb8, Nxd6, White wins a pawn, but loses the rook for the knight.

**Best plan:**
- Trading rooks is good as we are up material.
- h8h5 Rxh5, Nxd6+ Kc7, Nxf5, Rxf5, White is up a pawn, but Black's bishop is gone, and White has a passed pawn majority.

**Alternative:**
- h8d8: Threatens d6 pawn, but Black can defend with Bc8.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to trade rooks and then win the bishop and pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h8h5
```

2025-06-22 01:48:49,292 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.26s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1k1b4/3p4/1N1P3R/p7/8/PPP2PPP/2K5 w - - 1 45

**White:** King on c1, rook on h5, knight on b5, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on b7, bishop on d7, pawn on a4, d6

**Material:** White is up the exchange (rook for bishop), and has a strong knight on b5. Black's king is on b7, somewhat exposed. Black's bishop on d7 is defending, and Black has a dangerous passed pawn on d6. White's rook on h5 is very active.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can play Nxd6+, forking king and bishop, but after Kc7, White can take the bishop.  
- White can also play Nxd6+ and after Kc7, Rh7, threatening Rxd7+ and mate threats.  
- The rook on h5 can swing to h7, h8, or h6, but none are immediate mates.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Nxd6+ (fork, wins bishop)
2. Rh7 (threatening Rxd7)
3. Rook moves along the h-file (h6, h7, h8)
4. Knight moves (b5-d6, b5-c3, b5-a3, b5-d4)
5. Pawn moves (not urgent)

**Calculation:**

1. **Nxd6+**  
   - ... Kc7 (forced)  
   - Nxd7 Kxd7  
   - Now White is up a full rook for a pawn. Black's a4 pawn is weak, White can mop up.  
   - Alternatively, after Nxd6+ Kc7, White can play Rh7, but Black can play a3, but White is still up a rook.

2. **Rh7**  
   - Threatening Rxd7, but Black can play Bxb5, and White loses the knight.  
   - So, Nxd6+ is stronger.

3. **Other rook moves**  
   - h6, h7, h8 don't threaten anything immediate.

**Conclusion:**  
Nxd6+ wins the bishop for free, and after Kc7, Nxd7 Kxd7, White is up a rook and should win easily.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-22 01:49:01,139 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.80s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1k6/3b4/3N4/3P3R/p7/8/PPP2PPP/2K5 w - - 1 46

**White:** King on c1, rook on h5, knight on d6, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on b8, bishop on d7, pawn on a4

**Material:** White is up a rook for a bishop and pawn.  
**Position:** White's knight is very strong on d6, controlling key squares. The rook on h5 is active. Black's king is boxed in on b8, and the bishop is passive on d7. Black's only real counterplay is the a-pawn, but it's not advanced enough to be a threat yet.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can consider checks with the rook, but none are immediately decisive.
- The knight can jump to several squares, but none deliver a check.
- The rook can swing to the kingside or central files.
- White can also consider improving the king's position or pushing pawns, but the priority should be to press the advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6e8** (knight to e8): Attacks the bishop, but the bishop can move.
2. **d6f7**: Attacks the bishop, but not decisive.
3. **h5h8**: Rook to h8, threatening mate on b8 if the knight moves, but not immediate.
4. **h5h7**: Rook to h7, attacking the bishop.
5. **h5h6**: Rook to h6, attacking the bishop.
6. **d6f5**: Knight to f5, attacking the bishop.
7. **d6e4**: Knight to e4, attacking the bishop.
8. **c1d2**: King to d2, centralizing.
9. **Pawn moves**: Not urgent.

**Tactical ideas:**  
- If the rook can get to b7, it would be mate, but that's not possible yet.
- The bishop on d7 is pinned to the king by the knight, so moving the knight with tempo could be strong.
- The rook can attack the bishop from the h-file.

**Best move?**
- **h5h8** is interesting: if Black plays Kc7, then Nb5# is mate. But after h5h8, Black has no good moves: the king can't move, the bishop can't move, and the pawn can't move. It's zugzwang.

Let's check this line:
1. h5h8 (threatening mate if the knight moves)
   - If Black plays Kc7, then Nb5# is mate.
   - If Black plays a3, then bxa3, and Black is still in zugzwang.
   - If Black plays Bc8, then Nxc8, Kxc8, and White is up a rook.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- After h5h8, Black is in zugzwang. Any move loses material or allows mate.

**Conclusion:**  
**h5h8** is the strongest move, putting Black in zugzwang and threatening to win material or deliver mate.

My move:
```
h5h8
```

2025-06-22 01:49:08,519 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.44s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on c1, rook on h8, knight on d6, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on b8, bishop on c8, pawn on a4

**Material:**
- White is up a rook and a knight for a bishop and a pawn. White has a decisive material advantage.

**Threats:**
- White's rook on h8 is very active.
- The knight on d6 is dominating and can jump to several key squares.
- Black's king is stuck on b8, bishop on c8 is passive, and the a4 pawn is not dangerous.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxc8** (d6c8): Captures the bishop, further increasing material advantage.
2. **Rook moves**: h8-g8, h8-f8, etc. But these don't threaten anything immediate.
3. **Knight moves**: d6-e8, d6-f7, d6-b7, d6-f5, d6-b5, d6-e4, d6-c4. But none are as strong as capturing the bishop.
4. **Pawn moves**: Not urgent, as White has a winning position.

**Analysis:**
- **d6c8** (Nxc8) wins the bishop, leaving Black with only a pawn for a rook and a knight. This is a simple and strong move, removing any hope for Black.

**Check for tactics:**
- After Nxc8, Black cannot check or threaten anything. The a4 pawn is not dangerous, and White can easily mop up the remaining material.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the bishop with the knight.

2025-06-22 01:49:23,720 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.49s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1kN4R/8/8/3P4/8/p7/PPP2PPP/2K5 w - - 0 48

- White: King on c1, Knight on c8, Rook on h8, Pawn on d5, a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on b8, Pawn on a3

White is completely winning. The Black king is stuck on b8, and the a3 pawn is not dangerous. The best plan is to checkmate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
- h8g8: Rook to g8, threatening to invade the 8th rank.
- c8e7: Knight to e7, threatening to go to c6+ or f5.
- d5d6: Advance the passed pawn.
- b2a3: Capture the a3 pawn.

**Key tactical idea:** 
- b2a3 immediately wins the last Black pawn, leaving Black with only the king, and White can proceed to checkmate without any counterplay.

**Other moves** (like rook maneuvers or knight moves) are fine, but capturing the a3 pawn is clean and removes any hope for Black.

**Final move:**
```
b2a3
```

2025-06-22 01:49:31,141 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.51s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on c1, rook on h8, knight on c8, pawns on a3, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on b7

**Material:**
- White: Rook, knight, 6 pawns
- Black: King

**Immediate threats:**
- Black has only the king, so White's task is to checkmate as efficiently as possible.
- The Black king is on b7, near the edge, but not yet in a mating net.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Rook moves along the h-file (h8g8, h8f8, etc.)
2. Rook moves along the 8th rank (not available)
3. Knight moves: c8e7, c8a7, c8d6, c8b6
4. King moves: c1d2, c1b2, c1d1, c1b1
5. Pawn moves: d5d6, a3a4, h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4

**Strategic plan:**
- The goal is to restrict the Black king and force it to the edge/corner for checkmate.
- The rook and knight are the main checkmating pieces.
- The king should help, but is currently far away.
- Advancing pawns is not urgent unless it helps bring the king closer or restricts the Black king.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The knight on c8 can move to a7 or b6 to control escape squares.
- The rook can swing to the g-file (h8g8) to cut off the king from the c-file.
- The move d5d6 is interesting, as it supports the knight and may help bring the king in via d2-c3-d4.

**Best move?**
- Let's check if there is a forced mate or a way to restrict the king further.
- h8g8 cuts off the king from the c-file, so if the king moves to a6 or a8, the knight can help.
- c8d6 attacks b7 and supports the d5 pawn, but doesn't restrict the king much.
- c8a7 attacks b5 and c6, but not useful now.
- d5d6 prepares to bring the king in.

**Calculation:**
- 1. h8g8 Ka6 (only move)
- 2. Nc8-d6 (threatening mate on Ra8# if king goes to a5)
- But after 1...Ka6, the king is still not mated.

Alternatively, bringing the king closer is important, but the rook should cut off the king first.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to cut off the king with the rook: h8g8.

```
h8g8
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Rook (g8), Knight (c8), King (c1), 6 pawns (a3, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: King (c7)

**Position:**  
- Black's king is on c7, somewhat centralized but with limited mobility.
- White's rook is on g8, knight on c8, king on c1.
- White has a significant material advantage (rook + knight vs lone king).
- White's pawns are ready to advance, and Black has no pawns or pieces.

**Goal:**  
- Convert the material advantage to a win, ideally by restricting the Black king and pushing pawns for promotion, or by forcing mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8g7**: Bring the rook closer to the king, restricts Black's king further.
2. **g8g6**: Similar idea, but g7 is closer.
3. **c8e7+**: Check, but Black king can go to d6 or b6.
4. **d5d6+**: Pawn check, but Black can take with king.
5. **c2c4**: Start pushing pawns, but not urgent.
6. **a3a4**: Push a-pawn, but not urgent.
7. **c8a7**: Knight move, but not forcing.

**Best plan:**  
- Use the rook to cut off the Black king and drive it to the edge.
- Use knight and king to help with the mate or support pawn promotion.
- No need to rush pawn moves yet.

**Best move:**  
- **g8g7**: This move cuts off the Black king from the 7th rank, further restricting its movement and preparing to bring the king up or coordinate with the knight for mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g8g7
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King on c1, Knight on c8, Rook on g7, pawns on a3, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
- Black: King is not on the board (White to move, so Black's King is somewhere off the board in the FEN, but let's assume it's on the board and not in check).

**Position:**  
- White is up a full rook and knight, with a passed pawn on d5 and a pawn majority on the kingside.
- Black has no pieces visible, so White is completely winning.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **g7g8**: Rook to 8th rank, but doesn't do much.
2. **d5d6**: Advance the passed pawn.
3. **c8e7**: Knight to e7, centralizing.
4. **a3a4**: Advance the a-pawn.
5. **h2h4**: Advance the h-pawn.
6. **c2c4**: Advance the c-pawn.

**Best plan:**  
- Push the passed d-pawn, supported by the rook and knight.
- Centralize the king if possible.
- Advance pawns to create more threats.

**Immediate threats:**  
- No immediate threats from Black.
- White can play d5-d6, threatening d6-d7 and then d7-d8=Q.

**Is there a faster way to win?**  
- Pushing the d-pawn is the most direct route to victory.

**Final move:**  
Push the passed pawn.

2025-06-22 01:49:48,643 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.71s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on c1, Knight on c8, Rook on g7, Pawn on d6, a3, c2, f2, g2, h2, a2, c1
- Black: King on e8

**Material:**
- White is up a rook and knight, with a healthy pawn structure.
- Black has only the king.

**Threats:**
- White can try to force checkmate with the rook and knight, with the help of the king and pawns if needed.
- Immediate mate is not available, but White can press for mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6d7+**: Pawn check. Black must move to f8 or d8.
2. **c8e7+**: Knight check. Black must move to f8 or d8.
3. **g7g8+**: Rook check. Black must move to f7 or d7.
4. **King moves**: Not urgent, but could help centralize.
5. **Pawn moves**: Not urgent, but could help in the long run.

**Analysis:**
- **d6d7+**: If ...Ke7, then Re8# is mate. If ...Kf8, then Nf6 is coming.
- **c8e7+**: If ...Kf8, then Rg8# is mate. If ...Kd8, then Nc6+.
- **g7g8+**: If ...Ke7, then Re8# is mate.

Let's check **d6d7+**:
- 1. d6d7+ Ke7 (forced)
- 2. Re8# (mate)

So, **d6d7+** leads to forced mate in 2.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d6d7
```

2025-06-22 01:49:54,503 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.19s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on c1, Knight on c8, Rook on g7, pawns on a3, c2, d7, f2, g2, h2, a2, h2
- Black: King on d8

**Material:** White is up a rook and knight, with many pawns. Black has only the king.

**Threats and Plan:**
- The d7 pawn is one step from queening, but currently blocked by the Black king.
- The White rook on g7 is cutting off the Black king from the 7th rank.
- The knight on c8 controls e7 and d6, but not enough to force the king away from d8.
- The White king is on c1, far from the action.
- Advancing the a-pawn (a3-a4) is possible, but not urgent.
- Advancing the h-pawn or g-pawn is possible.
- Moving the rook along the 7th rank is possible, but g7 is optimal for now.
- Moving the knight could help, but c8 is already controlling key squares.
- Bringing the king closer (c1-d2) is a long-term plan.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. h2-h4 (start pushing the h-pawn)
2. g2-g4 (start pushing the g-pawn)
3. a3-a4 (start pushing the a-pawn)
4. c2-c4 (start pushing the c-pawn)
5. c1-d2 (activate the king)
6. Rook moves (but g7 is optimal)
7. Knight moves (but c8 is optimal)

**Best Plan:**
- Since Black has no counterplay, White can improve position at leisure.
- The fastest way to win is to bring the king closer to support the d7 pawn and force promotion.
- Pushing pawns is also fine, but activating the king is most direct.

**Move Selection:**
- c1-d2: King activation, heading toward d3, e4, f5, etc.
- h2-h4: Pawn push, but not urgent.
- a3-a4: Pawn push, but not urgent.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to activate the king.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

FEN: 2N5/2kP2R1/8/8/8/P7/P1PK1PPP/8 w - - 3 54

White: King d2, Rook g7, Knight c8, Pawn d7, a3, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King c7

White to move.

**Immediate tactical opportunities:**
- The pawn on d7 is one square from promotion, and d8 is not covered by Black.
- Promoting d7-d8 to a queen or rook is possible.
- Black's king is on c7, so after d8=Q, the queen is not attacked.
- White is up massive material and has a completely winning position.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d7-d8=Q (promote to queen)
2. d7-d8=R (promote to rook)
3. Other moves (not urgent, as promotion is decisive)

**Check for stalemate:**
- After d8=Q, Black's king is on c7, and has squares to move to (b7, b8, c8, d8), so no stalemate.
- Black will be down a queen and a rook, with no counterplay.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- After d8=Q, White threatens mate in a few moves with Qd7+ or Qc7+.
- No immediate mate, but the win is trivial.

**Conclusion:**  
Promoting the pawn to a queen is the most decisive move.

Final move:
```
d7d8q

2025-06-22 01:50:05,331 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.23s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on d2, Knight on c8, Rook on g7, pawns on a3, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2, h3
- Black: No pieces (Black is checkmated or has resigned pieces)
- White to move

**Material:**
- White is up a full rook and knight, and has a dominating position.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- The Black king is not on the board, so Black has no moves. However, the FEN shows it's White's turn, so let's look for the best move.

**Candidate moves:**
- Promote the position further, but since Black has no pieces, the goal is to convert to a win as quickly as possible.
- The knight on c8 is not attacked, and the rook on g7 is very active.
- Advancing pawns or centralizing the king are both good, but let's look for the most forcing move.

**Best move:**
- The move c8e7 brings the knight closer to the kingside and supports potential mating nets.
- Moving the rook along the 7th rank (g7g8, g7h7, etc.) is also possible, but not as forcing.
- Advancing pawns (h2h4, g2g4, etc.) is slow.
- Centralizing the king (d2e3) is also good, but not as forcing.

**Conclusion:**
- The move c8e7 brings the knight closer to the action and prepares for a quick mate if the Black king appears.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c8e7
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King (d2), Knight (e7), Rook (g7), pawns (a3, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2)  
Black: King (c7)

**White to move.**

**Immediate tactical ideas:**  
- The Black king is cut off from the 7th and 8th ranks by the rook on g7 and the knight on e7.
- White is up a rook and a knight, with many pawns.
- There are no Black pieces left, so no counterplay.
- The fastest way to checkmate is to coordinate the rook and knight to box in the king, or to bring the king closer.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g7g8** (promote rook to g8, but that's not a legal move, since it's not a pawn)
2. **g7h7** (rook to h7, but doesn't help)
3. **g7f7** (rook to f7, doesn't help)
4. **g7g6** (rook to g6, could help bring the king in)
5. **e7g8** (knight to g8, doesn't help)
6. **d2e3** (king up)
7. **a3a4** (push pawn)
8. **h2h3**, **g2g3**, etc. (pawn moves)

**Best plan:**  
- Bring the king closer to help with the checkmate.
- Keep the rook on the 7th rank to cut the king off.
- The knight can help cover escape squares.

**Move selection:**  
- **d2e3**: King closer, no risk, helps with the mate net.
- **g7g6**: Prepares to swing the rook to the c-file or 6th rank, but not as direct.
- **a3a4**: Not urgent.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to bring the king closer for a textbook mate.

```

2025-06-22 01:50:17,687 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.33s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on e3, Knight on e7, Rook on g7, pawns on a3, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on b6

**Material:** White is up a rook and a knight, with many pawns. Black only has a king.

**Objective:** Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate checks:**
- Rg7g6+ is possible, but the Black king can move to a5 or a7.
- Rg7g8 is not a check, but it cuts off the 8th rank.
- Ne7d5+ is not possible, as d5 is not a legal knight move from e7.
- Ne7c8+ is possible, but the king can move to a5 or a7.

**Stalemate check:** Black king has squares to move to, so no immediate stalemate.

**Best plan:** Bring the king closer, coordinate rook and knight to restrict the Black king, and avoid stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Rg7g6+ (check, but king escapes to a5 or a7)
2. Rg7g8 (cuts off 8th rank, but not a check)
3. Ne7d5 (not legal)
4. Ne7c8+ (check, king escapes to a5 or a7)
5. a3a4 (expands space, but not urgent)
6. e3d4 (bring king closer)

**Analysis:**
- Rg7g6+ K moves to a5 or a7, then we can bring the king closer.
- Rg7g8 is a waiting move, but doesn't improve position.
- Ne7c8+ K moves to a5 or a7, similar to above.
- e3d4 brings the king closer, but doesn't threaten mate.

**Optimal move:** Let's play Rg7g6+ to push the king further to the edge, then coordinate with the king and knight for a swift mate.

Final move:
```
g7g6
```

2025-06-22 01:50:24,457 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.91s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (White to move):**
- White: Ke3, Ne7, Rg6, pawns a3, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: Kc5

**Material:** White is up a rook and a knight, with many pawns. Black has only the king.

**Threats and goals:** 
- Black has no counterplay. White's only task is to checkmate the black king.
- The black king is on c5, with escape squares b5, b4, c4, d4, d5, d6, c6, b6.
- White's rook on g6 can swing to the c-file or 6th rank to cut off the king.
- The knight on e7 can jump to c8, c6, d5, f5, g8.
- White's king is close enough to help.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rg5+** (not possible, rook is on g6, not g5)
2. **Rc6+** (Rg6c6): This checks the king and forces it to move. Let's see where the king can go:
   - Kb5, Kd5, Kb4, Kd4, Kc4, Kb6, Kd6, Kc6 (but c6 is occupied by rook)
   - After Rc6+, Kb5 is forced (as c6 is occupied, d6 is covered by knight, d5 is covered by knight, c4 is covered by king, b4 is free).
3. **Ne7-c8+**: This checks the king, but the king can go to b5, d5, b4, d4, c4.
4. **Ne7-d5**: This attacks the king, but not a check.
5. **King moves**: e.g., Ke4, but not urgent.
6. **Pawn moves**: Not urgent.

**Best move:**
- **Rg6c6+** is the most forcing move, as it checks the king and restricts its movement.

Let's check the lines after Rc6+:
- 1. Rc6+ Kb5 (only move)
- Then, Ne7-d5 (with threat of a fork), or a4+ to push the king further.

But let's play the check first and keep pressing.

**Final move:**
```
g6c6

5. **c2c4+** (Pawn check): Forces the king to a6 or a4, but after bxc4, White can recapture with the rook.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The Black king is nearly boxed in. If we can cut off more squares, we can force mate.
- The rook and knight can coordinate for a mate, especially with the king on the edge.

**Best move search:**
- **e7d5+**: If K moves to a4, then Rc4+ is mate. If K moves to a6, then Nc7+ wins the king.
- **c2c4+**: If bxc4, then Rxc4 and the king is on the edge, but not mated yet.

Let's check **e7d5+**:
- 1. Nd5+ Ka5 (only move)
- 2. Rc5+ Ka4 (only move)
- 3. Nc3# (mate)

Therefore, **e7d5+** is a forced mate in 3.

So the best move is:
```
e7d5
```

2025-06-22 01:50:37,284 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.57s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e3), Rook (c6), Knight (d5), pawns (a3, c2, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: King (a5)

**Position:**
- Black's king is on the edge (a5), with no other pieces.
- White's rook is very active on c6, and the knight on d5 controls key squares.
- White's king is centralized and can support pawn advances.
- White has a huge material advantage and can win by either checkmating or promoting a pawn.

**Immediate threats:**
- No immediate mate, but Black's king is nearly boxed in.
- White can try to restrict the Black king further, or start pushing pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c6c5+**: Check, but Black king just goes to a4.
2. **c6c4**: Cuts off the king from the 4th rank, but not a check.
3. **d5c7**: Knight moves, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
4. **a3a4**: Starts pushing the a-pawn, but not urgent.
5. **e3d4**: King centralizes, but not urgent.
6. **c6c7**: Prepares to support pawn promotion, but not urgent.
7. **c6a6**: Rook cuts off the king from escaping to the a-file, but king is already on a5.

**Best plan:**
- The most direct way to win is to restrict the Black king further and push pawns.
- The Black king is on a5. If we play **c6c5+**, Black must play Ka4, then we can play Nc3+ and force the king to b3, then Rb6+ and so on, but this is a bit slow.
- Alternatively, **c6c4** is a strong move, as it cuts off the king from the 4th rank, and then we can bring the king up or push pawns.

But let's check if there's a forced mate or a way to box in the king.

**Calculation:**
- c6c5+ Ka4
- Nc3+ Ka5 (only move)
- Rb6 (threatening mate on b5)
- ... but Black can play Kxb6 if we play Rb5, so not immediate.

Alternatively, **c6c4** is a strong, patient move, cutting off the king and preparing to bring the king up or push pawns.

**Conclusion:**
- The move **c6c4** is the most precise, as it restricts the Black king and prepares to bring the king up or push pawns. There is no need to rush; Black has no counterplay.

My move:
```
c6c4
```

2025-06-22 01:50:44,575 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.67s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e3), Rook (c4), Knight (d5), Pawns (a3, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: King (a6)

**Position:**
- Black's king is on a6, boxed in by its own lack of pieces and White's control.
- White's rook on c4 cuts off the 4th rank.
- White's knight on d5 controls b6, c7, f6, f4, b4, c3.
- White's king is centralized on e3.
- White has a passed pawn on a3, and a2 is ready to support it.
- Black has no pieces left.

**Goal:** Checkmate Black's king or force promotion.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a3-a4: Push the passed pawn, but Black's king is already boxed in.
2. c4-c8: Rook to the 8th rank, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
3. d5-c7: Knight to c7, threatening a8 and b5, but not a check.
4. d5-b4: Knight to b4, threatens a6 directly, but not a check.
5. e3-d4: King closer, but not urgent.
6. c4-c6: Rook to c6, cutting off the king further, but not necessary.
7. c4-a4: Rook to a4, threatening mate ideas.
8. d5-c3: Knight to c3, not helpful.

**Best plan:** 
- The Black king is trapped on a6, with only a6 and b6 as escape squares.
- If we play c4-a4, we threaten Ra6#, but the knight is in the way.
- If we play d5-c7, then after Ka7, we can play Ra4# (but the knight is not on b5).
- If we play d5-b4, then after Ka5, Ra6# is mate.

But after d5-b4, Black's only move is Ka5, then Ra6# is checkmate.

**Let's check:**
1. d5-b4 (threatening Ra6#)
   - If Ka5, Ra6# is mate.
   - If Ka7, Ra6# is mate.
   - If Kb6, then Rc6+ wins.

So, d5-b4 is a direct threat, and Black cannot escape mate.

**Final move:**
```
d5b4
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1k6/8/8/1NR5/P3K3/P1P2PPP/8 w - - 14 62

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White: Rook (c4), Knight (b4), King (e3), pawns on a3, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King (b7)

**Position:**
- Black's king is on b7, cut off from the center and queenside.
- White's rook is on c4, knight on b4, king on e3, and pawns are advanced.
- White is completely winning; Black has no counterplay.

**Plan:**
- The Black king is cut off from the queenside and the center.
- White can use the rook to further restrict the Black king, then bring the king up and push pawns.
- The most precise way is to cut the king off on the 7th rank with Rc7, then bring the king up and push pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c4c7 (Rc7): Cuts off the king from the 7th rank. The king is now stuck on b7 and a7.
2. c4c8 (Rc8): Also cuts off the king, but c7 is more flexible for supporting pawn advances.
3. b4c6+ (Nc6+): Check, but the king just goes to a8 or c8, and the knight is less useful there.
4. a3a4: Start pushing pawns, but first, restrict the king.

**Best move:**
- **Rc7** (c4c7) is the most precise. It cuts the king off, supports pawn advances, and keeps maximum flexibility.

**Final move:**
```
c4c7
```

2025-06-22 01:50:57,021 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.76s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King (e3), Rook (c7), Knight (b4), Pawns (a3, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2)  
Black: King (a8)

**Position:**  
- Black has only the king on a8.
- White's rook is on c7, knight on b4, king on e3, pawns are advanced and safe.
- Black's king is on the edge and cornered.

**Goal:**  
- Checkmate Black as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate checks:**  
- Rook moves: c7c8+ is check, but after Ka7, mate is not immediate.
- Knight moves: b4c6+ is check, but after Ka8, mate is not immediate.
- Rook moves along the 7th rank: c7h7, c7g7, etc., do not deliver check.
- Advancing pawns or moving the king does not threaten mate.

**Stalemate risk:**  
- If the Black king has no legal moves and is not in check, it's stalemate.  
- Currently, Black's king is on a8, and a7 is empty.

**Best plan:**  
- Bring the rook to the 8th rank to cut off the Black king.
- Use the knight and king to support a checkmate net.
- Avoid stalemate by ensuring Black always has a move until mate is delivered.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. c7c8+ (Rook to 8th rank, check)
   - Black must play Ka7.
   - Then, White can bring the king or knight closer, or use the rook to deliver mate.
2. b4c6+ (Knight check)
   - Black must play Ka8.
   - No immediate mate.

**Calculation after c7c8+:**
1. c7c8+ Ka7
2. Nc6+ Ka8 (only move)
3. Rb8# (mate)

**Let's check for stalemate after c7c8+ Ka7 Nc6+ Ka8:**
- Black king is on a8, White rook on c8, knight on c6, White king on e3.
- Rb8# is mate.

**Conclusion:**  
The fastest mate is:
1. c7c8+ Ka7
2. Nc6+ Ka8
3. Rb8#

So, the best move is:
```
c7c8
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on e3, Rook on c8, Knight on b4, pawns on a3, c2, f2, g2, h2, a2, b4, b4
- Black: King on b7

**Material:** White is up a rook and a knight for nothing. Black has only a king left.

**Immediate threats:** None from Black. White can checkmate with correct technique.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rook moves: c8h8, c8g8, c8f8, c8e8, c8d8, c8b8, c8a8, c8c7, c8c6, c8c5, c8c4, c8c3
- Knight moves: b4c6, b4a6, b4d5, b4d3
- King moves: e3f4, e3e4, e3d4, e3f3, e3d3, e3e2, e3d2
- Pawn moves: a3a4, h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4

**Goal:** Checkmate the Black king as quickly as possible.

**Best plan:** 
- Cut the king off with the rook, then bring the king and knight closer to box the Black king in.
- The Black king is on b7. If we play Rc8-c8, the king can only go to a7 or a8 if not cut off.
- Rook to c8-b8 is a strong move, cutting the king off from the b-file, but the king is already on b7.
- Rook to c8-c7 would force the king to a8 or a7, but the king is already on b7.
- Rook to c8-c6 is not useful yet.
- Rook to c8-c4 or c8-c3, preparing to swing the rook to the a-file, could be useful.
- Knight moves: b4-d5 attacks c7 and e7, but doesn't immediately help.
- King moves: e3-d4 or e3-f4, bringing the king closer.

**Checkmate pattern:** With rook and knight, the classic technique is to box the king in with the rook, use the knight to control escape squares, and bring the king in.

**Immediate move:** The most effective is to cut the king off further. Rook to c8-c6 is a good waiting move, but perhaps better is to bring the king closer.

**But let's check if we can immediately force the king to the edge:**
- Rook to c8-c7: Black king cannot go to c8, only a8 or a7. But king is already on b7.
- Rook to c8-c8: No effect.
- Rook to c8-b8: If king moves, can go to a7 or a8.
- Rook to c8-a8: Not possible, as rook is not on the a-file.

**What about knight moves?**
- Knight to d5: Controls c7 and e7, but doesn't help immediately.
- Knight to c6: Attacks b8 and a7, but king is on b7.

**What about king moves?**
- e3-d4: Brings king closer.
- e3-f4: Brings king closer.

**Best move:** Bring the king closer to help with the mate. e3-d4 is the most direct.

**Final move:**
```
e3d4
```

2025-06-22 01:51:11,201 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.21s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (White to move):**
- White: King on d4, Knight on b4, Pawn on a3, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on c8

**Material:** White is up a knight and several pawns. Black has only the king.

**Strategic goals:** 
- Convert the material advantage to a win.
- Avoid stalemate traps (since Black has only the king).
- Advance pawns carefully, keeping the Black king restricted.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The Black king is on c8, boxed in by its own lack of pieces and White's pawns.
- Advancing the a-pawn is tempting, but let's check for stalemate risks.
- The knight on b4 covers a6 and c6, restricting the Black king further.
- The White king can support pawn advances or help shepherd the Black king to a corner for mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a4 (advance the a-pawn)
2. c4 (advance the c-pawn)
3. h4/g4/f4 (advance kingside pawns)
4. King moves (e.g., d4e5, d4d5, d4c5)
5. Knight moves (e.g., b4c6, b4a6, b4d5)

**Risks:**
- Stalemate: If the Black king cannot move and is not in check, it's a draw.
- Need to keep Black king with at least one escape square until ready to mate.

**Best plan:**
- Advance the a-pawn to a4, then a5, a6, a7, a8=Q, but only when the Black king has escape squares.
- Alternatively, bring the king closer to support pawn promotion and avoid stalemate.

**Checking stalemate after a4:**
- Black king on c8, squares b7, c7, d7, d8 are all empty and accessible.
- After a4, Black king can still move to d7, d8, b7, c7.

**Conclusion:** Advancing the a-pawn is safe and logical.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-22 01:51:18,208 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King on d4, Knight on b4, Pawns on a4, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on d8

**Position:**  
- White is up a knight and several pawns.
- Black's king is on d8, boxed in by White's pawns and pieces.
- White's king is active and centralized.
- White has a passed a-pawn and c-pawn, and can easily create more passed pawns.
- No Black pawns or pieces remain.

**Objective:**  
- Convert the material advantage to a win.
- Avoid stalemate traps (Black king has limited moves).
- Advance pawns carefully, keeping Black king restricted.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. a4a5 — Advance the a-pawn, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.
2. c2c4 — Advance the c-pawn, but doesn't change much.
3. b4c6 — Knight jump, attacks d8, but doesn't force anything.
4. d4c5 — King move, but doesn't improve position.
5. d4e5 — King move, but doesn't improve position.
6. d4d5 — King move, but doesn't improve position.
7. b4d5 — Knight jump, attacks e7, but doesn't change much.
8. a2a3 — Prepares a4-a5, but slow.
9. f2f3, g2g3, h2h3 — Pawn moves, but not urgent.

**Best plan:**  
- Bring the knight closer to the Black king to restrict its movement.
- Start advancing the a-pawn, but be careful not to stalemate the Black king.
- The Black king currently has c8, d8, e8, c7, d7, e7 squares available.

**Stalemate check:**  
If we play a4-a5, Black still has moves.  
If we play b4c6, Black still has moves.

**Best move:**  
Advancing the a-pawn is logical, but let's see if there's a more forcing move.  
Moving the knight to c6 attacks d8 and e7, further restricting the Black king.

After b4c6, Black's king is still not stalemated, but is more restricted.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to centralize the knight and restrict the Black king further.

2025-06-22 01:51:25,491 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.34s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on d4, Knight on c6, pawns on a4, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on c8

**Material:** White is up a knight and has a large pawn majority. Black has only the king.

**Immediate goals:** 
- Convert material advantage to a win.
- Avoid stalemate.
- Activate king and knight to support pawn promotion.
- Avoid unnecessary pawn moves that could lead to stalemate or allow Black to blockade.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c6e7+**: Knight check. Black king must move to d8 or b8.
2. **d4e5**: King advances, centralizing further.
3. **a4a5**: Pawn advance, but not urgent.
4. **c2c4**: Pawn advance, but not urgent.
5. **c6d8+**: Knight check, but king just goes to d8.
6. **Other knight moves**: Not as forcing.

**Best plan:** Use the knight to restrict the Black king, then bring the king in to support pawn advances. Avoid stalemating the Black king on the edge.

**Calculation:**
- **c6e7+**: Black king must go to d8 or b8. Let's say Kd8. Then White can play Nc6, repeating, or bring the king in.
- **d4e5**: King centralizes, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
- **a4a5**: Not urgent.
- **c2c4**: Not urgent.

**Key point:** The Black king is on c8. If we play Nc6-e7+, the king must go to d8 or b8. After that, we can use our king to approach.

**Is there any stalemate risk?** Not immediately, but we must be careful as we push pawns.

**Best move:** Let's play the check with the knight to force the Black king to the edge, then use our king to approach.

**Final decision:**

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King (d4), Knight (e7), pawns (a4, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2)  
Black: King (b8)

**Position:**  
- Black has only the king left, stuck on the queenside.
- White has a knight and 6 pawns, with a king very active on d4.
- White's a4 pawn is advanced, and the rest are on their original squares except c2.
- The knight on e7 is very well placed, controlling key squares.

**Objective:**  
- Convert the material advantage to a win.
- Avoid stalemates (very important with so many pawns and a lone king).
- Advance pawns methodically, keeping the Black king boxed in.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. a4-a5: Advance the a-pawn, but not urgent, as Black king is already boxed in.
2. c2-c4: Advance the c-pawn, but again, not urgent.
3. h2-h3/g2-g3/f2-f3: Pawn moves on kingside, but not urgent.
4. d4-e5: Centralize the king further, but e5 is not more active than d4.
5. d4-d5: Advance the king, but c6 is controlled by the knight.
6. e7-c6: Move the knight to c6, but it doesn't improve the position.
7. e7-g8: Move the knight to g8, but not useful.
8. e7-f5: Move the knight to f5, but doesn't help.
9. e7-d5: Move the knight to d5, but not useful.

**Best plan:**  
- The king is already optimally placed.
- The knight is controlling c6 and d5, keeping the Black king boxed in.
- The best plan is to start advancing the a-pawn, as it is closest to promotion and the Black king is cut off.

**Check for stalemate:**  
- If a5 is played, Black still has b7 and c8 squares.
- No stalemate risk.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to advance the a-pawn.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King on d4, Knight on e7, pawns on a5, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on a7

**Position:**  
- White is completely winning: Black has only the king, White has a knight and a lot of pawns.
- The Black king is on the edge (a7), White's king is centralized (d4), and White's knight is close to the action (e7).
- White can push the a-pawn, but Black's king is already blocking the queening square.
- White can try to bring the king closer, but the knight can also help to restrict the Black king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a5-a6: Push the pawn, but Black's king can just stay on a7 and a8.
2. e7-c6: Knight closer to the queenside, but not threatening anything immediate.
3. d4-c5: King closer to the queenside, but not threatening anything immediate.
4. e7-c8: Knight to c8, attacking the a7 square, but the king is already there.
5. e7-d5: Knight to d5, centralizing, but not threatening anything.
6. d4-e5: King closer to the center, but not threatening anything.
7. h2-h4, g2-g4, etc.: Pushing kingside pawns, but not urgent.

**Best plan:**  
The quickest way to win is to use the king and knight to force the Black king away from the a-file, then promote the a-pawn. The knight can help control key squares (like b6 and c7) to box in the Black king.

**Key idea:**  
If the knight can get to c6, it can control b8 and a7, so the king can approach and help push the pawn.

**Move calculation:**  
- e7-c6: Knight to c6, attacking a7 and b8. If Black's king stays on a7, White can play king to c5 and then b6, and eventually force the king away.

Let's check if e7-c6 is safe:
- Black has no threats.
- After Nc6, Black's king is stuck on a7 or a8.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play the knight to c6, starting the process of boxing in the Black king and supporting the pawn promotion.

Let's analyze the position:

White:
- King on d4
- Knight on c6
- Pawns: a5, a2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black King on a6

Black:
- King on a6
- No other pieces

White is completely winning, with an extra knight and six pawns versus a lone king. The only thing to avoid is stalemating the Black king. The Black king is currently on a6, and White's a5 pawn controls b6, c6 knight controls b8, b4, a7, and the king on d4 is far away.

The plan is to advance pawns, but we must be careful not to stalemate the Black king. Let's check the candidate moves:

1. **a2a4**: Pushes the a-pawn, but the Black king is not stalemated because it can still go to b7 if needed.
2. **c2c4**: Pushes the c-pawn, no immediate threat.
3. **h2h4, g2g4, f2f4**: Pushing kingside pawns, safe.
4. **c6d8**: Knight moves, but not necessary right now.
5. **d4e5**: King moves closer to the action, but not urgent.

The most logical plan is to push the a-pawn to a6, then a7, and promote. However, if we play a2a4, Black is not stalemated, and we can continue to push.

**Double-checking for stalemate:**
- After a2a4, Black king is on a6, can move to b7 if needed.
- After a4a5, a5a6, a6a7, a7a8=Q, the Black king will be forced to move, and we can promote safely.

Therefore, the best move is to start pushing the a-pawn.

Final move:

2025-06-22 01:51:52,963 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.23s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King (d4), Knight (c6), Pawns (a5, c2, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: King (b7)

**Position:**  
- White's king is centralized and supports pawn advances.
- The knight on c6 is extremely powerful, controlling key squares and cutting off the Black king.
- Black's king is on b7, with no pawns or pieces left.
- White has a passed a-pawn on a5, ready to advance.
- White's c2 pawn can also advance, and the king can support both sides.

**Plan:**  
- The goal is to promote a pawn, ideally the a-pawn, since it's closest and the Black king is already cut off from the a-file by the knight.
- The Black king cannot approach the a-pawn due to the knight's control of a7 and b8.
- Advancing the a-pawn is safe and strong.

**Candidate moves:**  
- a5-a6: Advance the passed pawn, threatening to queen.
- c6-d8: Move the knight to support the pawn, but not necessary yet.
- King moves: Not urgent, as the king is well placed.
- Other pawn moves: Not urgent.

**Calculation:**  
- After a6, if Black plays Kxa6, it's illegal (knight covers a6).
- Black's king cannot approach the pawn.
- Next move, a7, and then a8=Q is unstoppable.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to push the a-pawn.

2025-06-22 01:51:58,733 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.79s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on d4, Knight on c6, Pawn on a6, a4, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on a8

**Material:** White is up a knight and several pawns. Black has only the king.

**Objective:** Checkmate the black king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Key considerations:**
- Black's king is trapped on a8, with only b8 and a7 as potential escape squares (but both are covered by White's knight and pawn).
- Be extremely careful not to stalemate Black by removing all pawn moves and not giving Black any legal moves.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a6a7: Pushes the pawn to a7, threatening a8=Q next. But after a7, Black has no legal moves except a8. Is this stalemate? Let's check:
   - After a7, Black's king is on a8, can't move to b8 (c6 knight covers), can't move anywhere else. Is this stalemate? Yes, because the king has no legal moves and is not in check. So a7 is stalemate. Not good.

2. c6d8: Move the knight to d8, keeping options open. The knight can help with mate, and we avoid stalemate.

3. d4d5: Move the king up, but doesn't help much.

4. c2c4: Advance the c-pawn, but not urgent.

5. f2f3, g2g3, h2h3: Pawn moves, but not urgent.

**Best plan:** Bring the knight to help with mate, but avoid stalemate. The knight can go to e6, then c7, then b5, etc., to help with mate.

**Immediate move:** Let's play the knight to d8, keeping all options open and not risking stalemate.

**Final move:**
```
c6d8

2025-06-22 01:52:06,051 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.31s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**White:**
- King on d4
- Knight on d8
- Pawn on a6, a4, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black King on a7

**Black:**
- King on a7

**Material:** White is up a full knight and has a clear path to promote the a-pawn. The Black king is cut off from the a-pawn by White's king and knight. White's plan is to promote the a-pawn, but must ensure that Black's king cannot approach or harass the pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a4a5: Advance the a-pawn, but it's already on a6, so this is not legal.
2. d8b7: Move the knight to b7, but that blocks the pawn.
3. d8f7: Move the knight to f7, centralizing and possibly supporting c2-c4.
4. d4e5: King moves closer to the center, but not necessary.
5. h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4: Pawn moves, but not urgent.

**Best plan:** 
- The a-pawn is ready to promote, but the knight on d8 blocks the king from approaching via b6 or b8. The Black king is stuck on a7.
- The knight can move to c6, controlling b8 and a7, and then the pawn can promote safely.

**Key calculation:**
- 1. d8c6+ Ka8 (only move)
- 2. a7 (promoting next move)

But after 1. d8c6+, Black's king is forced to a8, and then a7 is unstoppable.

**Double-checking for stalemate:**
- After 1. d8c6+ Ka8, 2. a7, Black has no moves but is not stalemated because the king is on a8 and White can promote next move.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play the knight to c6 with check, forcing the king to a8, and then push a7.

So, the best move is:
```
d8c6

2025-06-22 01:52:12,352 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.36s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

White: King on d4, Knight on c6, Pawn on a6, a4, c2, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on b6

Material: White is up a knight and several pawns.  
Position: The Black king is cut off from the queenside pawns by the knight and the a6 pawn. White's king is very active, and White has a clear path to push the queenside pawns or centralize further.

Candidate moves:
1. a6-a7: Pushes the pawn, but Black can play Kb7, attacking the pawn.
2. a4-a5+: Checks, but Black can play Kxa6, which is not possible since the pawn is on a6.
3. Nc6-a5: Attacks the Black king, but doesn't achieve much.
4. Nc6-e5: Centralizes the knight, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
5. Nc6-b4: Prepares to support a7, but the knight is very strong on c6.
6. c2-c4: Gains space and prepares to bring the king to c5.
7. d4-c4: King moves towards the queenside, supporting the pawns.
8. d4-e5: King centralizes, but the queenside is more urgent.

The best plan is to support the a-pawn's advance. If we play c2-c4, then Kb6-c5 is possible, but the Black king cannot approach the a-pawn easily because of the knight.

If we play a6-a7, Black will play Kb7, and then Nc6-a5+ forces the king away, and then we can promote.

Let's check this line:
1. a6-a7 Kb7
2. Nc6-a5+ Kxa7 (illegal, as pawn is on a7)
   If Kc8, then a8=Q.
   If Ka8, then Nc6-b4 wins.

But after a6-a7 Kb7, we can play Nc6-a5+ Ka8, and then Nc6-b4, and then a7-a8=Q is unstoppable.

Therefore, the best move is to push the pawn:

```
a6a7
```

2025-06-22 01:52:23,017 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.75s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King (d4), Knight (c6), Pawn (a7, c2, f2, g2, h2)  
Black: King (b7)

**White to move.**

**Key points:**
- The a7 pawn is one step from promotion.
- Black's king is on b7, blocking a8.
- White's knight on c6 controls a7 and b8, but not b7.
- White's king is far away from the action, but Black's king is cut off from the queenside.
- Promoting the a7 pawn is the most direct way to win, but we must ensure Black cannot capture the new queen or force a stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a7-a8=Q**: Promote immediately. After ...Kxa8, White loses the queen. But Black cannot capture the queen immediately because the king is on b7.
2. **Knight moves**: Moving the knight to give a check or to control a8, but none of the knight moves give check or help directly.
3. **King moves**: Advancing the king is too slow.
4. **Pawn moves**: Advancing other pawns is too slow.

**Critical calculation:**
- If 1. a8=Q+ Kxa8 is not possible because Black's king is on b7.
- If 1. a8=Q, Black's only legal move is Kxa8 (illegal, as the king is not on a8), or to move the king away, but the king cannot move to a6, b6, or c6 (all controlled by the knight or pawn).
- After 1. a8=Q, Black's king is on b7 and has no legal moves. Let's check for stalemate:
    - Black's king on b7, squares a6 (controlled by pawn), b6 (controlled by knight), c6 (controlled by knight), a8 (controlled by queen), c8 (controlled by queen), c7 (controlled by queen).
    - After a8=Q, is Black stalemated? Let's see:
        - King on b7, cannot move to a6, b6, c6, a8, c8, c7. All are controlled.
        - Black has no other pieces.
        - So after a8=Q, it is stalemate.

**Therefore, promoting to a queen immediately is stalemate.**

What about underpromotion?
- a8=R: Rook on a8, Black king on b7.
    - Black's king cannot move to a6 (pawn), b6 (knight), c6 (knight), a8 (rook), c8 (rook), c7 (rook).
    - All squares are controlled. Stalemate.

- a8=B: Bishop on a8, Black king on b7.
    - Black's king cannot move to a6 (pawn), b6 (knight), c6 (knight), a8 (bishop), c8 (bishop), c7 (bishop).
    - All squares are controlled. Stalemate.

- a8=N: Knight on a8, Black king on b7.
    - Black's king cannot move to a6 (pawn), b6 (knight), c6 (knight), a8 (knight), c8 (knight), c7 (knight).
    - All squares are controlled. Stalemate.

**Promoting immediately is stalemate in all cases.**

**Alternative plan:**
- Move the knight to allow the king to approach or to allow a pawn move.
- For example, move the knight away, then play a4-a5, then bring the king closer.

But we must avoid stalemate.

**Best plan:**
- Move the knight to a square that does not stalemate Black, and then slowly bring the king closer or push another pawn.

**Which knight move?**
- c6-d8: Knight to d8, controls b7 and e6. Black's king is still on b7, but now the knight is not controlling b6.
- Let's check if this gives Black any moves.
    - Black's king on b7, squares:
        - a6 (pawn), b6 (not controlled by knight anymore), c6 (not controlled), a8 (not controlled), c8 (not controlled), c7 (not controlled).
    - So after c6-d8, Black can play Kc8 or Ka8 or Kc7 or b6.

But wait, Black's king is on b7 and can move to b6, c8, c7, or a8.

But after c6-d8, Black can play Kc8 or Ka8.

But if Black plays Kc8, then a8=Q is not stalemate, because Black's king is on c8.

So, the best move is to move the knight away, for example, c6-d8.

**Final answer:**
```
c6d8
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (d4), Knight (d8), Pawn (a4, a7, c2, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: King (a8)

**Key points:**
- White is up a knight and has a pawn on a7, one step from promotion.
- Black's king is stuck on a8, and White's king is very active.
- White can win easily by promoting the a7 pawn, but must avoid stalemate.

**Stalemate risk:** 
- If White plays a7-a8=Q immediately, it is stalemate because Black's king on a8 has no legal moves and is not in check.

**Best plan:**
- Avoid immediate promotion.
- Improve the position, perhaps bring the king closer or make a waiting move with another pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a4-a5: Waiting move, keeps the pawn on a7.
2. h2-h3, g2-g3, f2-f3, c2-c3: All waiting moves, do not change the stalemate situation.
3. d8-f7: Move the knight, but doesn't help directly.
4. d4-e5: Move the king closer, but doesn't change the stalemate situation.

**Best move:**
- Play a waiting move with a pawn that does not change the stalemate situation, so that Black is forced to pass, and then White can maneuver the king and knight to force the Black king away from a8, then promote.

**Conclusion:**
Any pawn move except a7-a8 is fine, but a4-a5 is the most thematic, keeping the queenside pawns advancing.

2025-06-22 01:52:33,592 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.80s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (d4), Knight (d8), pawns (a5, c2, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: King (a7)

**Position:**
- Black's king is trapped in the corner (a7).
- White has a knight on d8, which controls important squares.
- White's king is active on d4.
- White has a pawn majority and can push for promotion.

**Immediate tactics:**
- The Black king cannot escape the a7 square.
- White can push the a-pawn to a6, threatening a7-a8=Q.
- The knight on d8 covers b7 and c6, so the Black king cannot escape.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a5-a6: Push the pawn, threatening to promote.
2. King moves: Not urgent, as the king is already well-placed.
3. Knight moves: Not necessary, as the knight is optimally placed.
4. Other pawn moves: Not urgent.

**Best move:**
- a5-a6 is the most direct and forces the issue. Black is in zugzwang, and White will promote the pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
a5a6
```

2025-06-22 01:52:40,055 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.33s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on d4, Knight on d8, Pawn on a6, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on a8

**Material:** White is up a knight and several pawns. Black has only the king left.

**Objective:** White should aim to promote a pawn (most likely the a-pawn), but must avoid stalemating the Black king. The Black king is trapped on a8, so any pawn move that doesn't allow the Black king to escape or cause stalemate is good.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
- a6a7: Pushes the pawn, but after a7, the Black king is stalemated (no legal moves), and it's not check, so it's a draw. This must be avoided.
- d8f7: Moves the knight, keeping the Black king in the corner, and prepares to bring the king closer or support pawn promotion.
- d8b7: Similar idea, but b7 covers a8 and c8.
- d8e6: Centralizes the knight.
- d4e5: King closer to support the pawn.
- h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4: Pawn moves, but none are urgent.

**Key point:** Do NOT play a6a7, as it stalemates Black.

**Best plan:** Improve the position of the knight or king, then promote the pawn with support.

**Best candidate moves:**
1. d8b7: Knight to b7, covering a8 and supporting a7-a8=Q.
2. d8f7: Knight to f7, but less relevant to the queenside.
3. d4e5: King closer to support the pawn.

**Analysis:**
- d8b7 is strong: After Nb7, White can play a7 next, and then a8=Q, with the knight covering a8, so no stalemate.
- d4e5 is also good, but slower.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play the knight to b7, preparing to promote the pawn safely.

2025-06-22 01:52:45,416 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.56s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on d4, Knight on b7, Pawn on a6, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on b8

**Material:**
- White is up a knight and several pawns.
- Black only has the king.

**Objectives:**
- Promote the a6 pawn, as it is very close to queening.
- Keep the Black king boxed in and prevent any counterplay (though Black has no pieces).
- Avoid stalemate traps, especially as the Black king is on the edge and has limited moves.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. a6-a7: Push the pawn, threatening to queen next move.
2. b7-d8+: Knight check, but the Black king can't move anyway.
3. d4-c5: Bring the king closer to support the pawn.
4. d4-e5: Centralize the king.
5. Other pawn moves: Not urgent.

**Critical consideration:** 
- If I play a7, Black's only move is Ka8, then I can play Kc5 or Nc5 to support a8=Q.
- Need to avoid stalemate: If the Black king is on b8 and I play a7, then after Ka8, if I play a8=Q immediately, it's stalemate (since Black's king has no legal moves and is not in check).

**So, the correct plan is:**
- Play a7, Black plays Ka8.
- Then, bring the king or knight to support the pawn, so when I queen, Black is not stalemated.

**Best move:**
```

2025-06-22 01:52:54,746 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.49s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King on d4, pawn on b7, pawns on c2, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on a8

**White's b7 pawn is one square from promotion, and Black's king is stuck on a8.**  
White's king is centralized and can support pawn advances.  
Black has no pieces and cannot stop White from promoting.

**Immediate tactical and strategic considerations:**  
- Promoting the b7 pawn is unstoppable.  
- However, promoting immediately (b7-b8=Q) is not possible since the pawn is on b7, not b8.
- The king on d4 can support the pawn if needed, but Black's king is too far to interfere.
- Advancing other pawns is unnecessary; the quickest win is to promote the b7 pawn.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. b7-d8 (illegal, as it's not a pawn move)  
2. b7-d6, b7-c5, b7-a5 (illegal, not pawn moves)  
3. d4-e5, d4-d5, d4-c5, d4-e4, d4-c4, d4-e3, d4-d3, d4-c3 (king moves)  
4. h2-h3, g2-g3, f2-f3, c2-c3, h2-h4, g2-g4, f2-f4, c2-c4 (pawn moves)  
5. b7-b8 (not listed, but b7 is a pawn, so b7-b8=Q is the promotion move, but not in the legal moves list. This means the pawn is not on b7's 7th rank, but on b7, so next move can be b7-b8=Q.)

But according to the FEN, the pawn is on b7, so b7-b8=Q is possible, but not in the legal moves list. The legal moves list is: b7d8, b7d6, b7c5, b7a5, etc. These are not pawn moves, so perhaps the notation is off, and the only pawn move is to promote.

But since the legal moves do not include b7b8q, perhaps the move is to move the king closer to support the pawn, but that's unnecessary.

**Best move:**  
Since Black's king is on a8 and cannot move, and White's king is close, the best move is to promote the b7 pawn. However, if that's not possible, then the next best is to play a waiting move with the king, e.g., d4-d5, to approach the pawn and support its promotion.

But since the pawn is on b7 and the king is on a8, the next move should be to promote the pawn. However, since the legal moves do not include b7b8q, perhaps the move is to move the king closer.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
d4d5
```

2025-06-22 01:52:59,205 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.71s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Material: White has a king on d5, knight on b7, pawns on c2, f2, g2, h2. Black has only a king on a7.
- White's king is very active, and the knight controls key squares. The black king is on the edge.
- White can push pawns to promote, but must avoid stalemating the black king.
- The black king has only a7 and a8 as legal squares, so any pawn move must be made with care to avoid stalemate.

Candidate moves:
- Advancing the c-pawn: c2-c4 or c2-c3. Both keep the black king with at least one legal move.
- Advancing kingside pawns: h2-h3, g2-g3, f2-f3, etc. These are safe and do not risk stalemate.
- Moving the knight: b7-d8, b7-d6, b7-c5, b7-a5. All keep the black king with at least one move.

The most direct plan is to push the c-pawn, as it is closest to promotion and the white king is well-placed to support it. c2-c4 is safe, as after c4, black still has a7 and a8.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c2c4

2025-06-22 01:53:04,898 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.78s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1k6/8/3K4/2P5/8/5PPP/8 w - - 0 82  
White: King on d5, pawns on c4, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on b7

**Material:**  
White: King + 4 pawns  
Black: King

**Objective:**  
Convert the material advantage (extra pawns) into a win. The Black king is on b7, far from the kingside pawns. The White king is centralized and can support the advance of the c-pawn or switch to the kingside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d5e6: King advances, but doesn't support c-pawn.
2. d5d6: King supports c5 push, keeps Black king cut off.
3. c4c5: Immediate pawn push, but Black can play Kc7 and try to blockade.
4. h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4: Kingside pawn moves, but not urgent.

**Analysis:**
- The main plan is to advance the c-pawn, supported by the king, and promote.
- If 1. d5d6, Black has no way to stop c5-c6-c7-c8=Q, as the king is too far.
- If 1. c4c5, Black plays Kc7, and after c6 Kc8, White needs to bring the king to support.
- Advancing the king to d6 is the most precise, as it supports c5 and keeps the Black king cut off.

**Best move:**  
1. d5d6

This is the most direct and accurate way to win.

```
d5d6

2025-06-22 01:53:10,417 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.54s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on d6, pawns on c4, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on b8

White is completely winning. The Black king is cut off on the queenside, and White has a passed c-pawn supported by the king. The plan is to advance the c-pawn, promote, and win.

Let's consider the candidate moves:

1. **d6e7**: King moves toward promotion squares, but doesn't help the c-pawn directly.
2. **d6d7**: King moves to d7, threatening to support c5-c6-c7-c8=Q. But Black's king is too far to stop the pawn.
3. **d6e6, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5**: King moves, but less active than d6d7.
4. **c4c5**: Advance the pawn immediately. Black can't stop it.
5. **h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4**: Pawn moves on kingside, not urgent.

Between **d6d7** and **c4c5**:

- If 1. d6d7, then Black is in zugzwang and must move the king, but can't approach the c-pawn.
- If 1. c4c5, White immediately pushes the passed pawn.

Let's check for any stalemate tricks. After c4c5, Black has no pawn moves and can only shuffle the king. White will play c6, c7, c8=Q, and then use the king to avoid stalemate.

**Best move:** Advance the c-pawn immediately.

```
c4c5

2025-06-22 01:53:14,702 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.55s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Material: White has a king on d6, pawns on c5, f2, g2, h2. Black has a king on c8.
- White's king is very active and centralized, while Black's king is stuck on the back rank.
- White's c5 pawn is advanced and can be supported by the king.
- White has a clear plan: advance the c-pawn, use the king to support its promotion, and win.

Candidate moves:
1. c5-c6: Pushes the pawn, threatening c7 next. If Black's king moves to d8, White can play c7+ and then promote.
2. d6-e7: Moves the king closer to the promotion square, but c6 seems more direct.
3. d6-c6: Retreats the king, not optimal.
4. h2-h3, g2-g3, f2-f3, etc.: Pawn moves on the kingside are not urgent.

Best move:
- Pushing the c-pawn is the most direct way to win. Black's king cannot stop the pawn without allowing White's king to support it.

Let's analyze the position:

White: King on d6, pawn on c6, pawns on f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on b8

It's White to move.

**Assessment:**
- White's king is very advanced and supports the c6 pawn.
- Black's king is cut off on the b-file.
- White can push c7, threatening to promote.
- Black cannot stop the c-pawn from promoting if White plays c7.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c6c7: Push the pawn, threatening to promote. Black cannot stop c8=Q.
2. d6e7: King moves, but doesn't help as much as pushing the pawn.
3. d6d7: King moves, but again, pushing the pawn is more direct.

**Calculation:**
- After c6c7, Black can only play Kc8, then c7c8=Q, and White will win easily.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the pawn.

2025-06-22 01:53:23,170 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.46s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on d6, pawn on c7, pawns on f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on b7.

It's White to move. The c7 pawn is one square from promotion, and the Black king is on b7, unable to stop the pawn from promoting. The best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

Let's check for any possible stalemate traps:
- If c7-c8=Q, Black's king is on b7 and has c8, a8, a7, a6, b6, and c6 as possible squares, but some are covered by the new queen and White king.
- After c8=Q, Black's king is on b7, and the White king is on d6. The new queen on c8 covers c7, c8, and c6. The White king covers c7, c6, e6, e7, d7, d5, e5, and c5. Black's king can still move to a8 or b6.

There is no stalemate, and White will have a decisive material advantage.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c7c8q
```

2025-06-22 01:53:28,469 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.43s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on d6, pawns on f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on c8

It's White to move. Black has no pawns or pieces, so the plan is to use the king to support the advance of the kingside pawns and promote one of them.

Candidate moves:
- King moves: d6e7, d6e6, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5
- Pawn moves: h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4

King moves:
- d6e7: King moves closer to the kingside, but not necessary yet.
- d6e6: Centralizes king, but doesn't help much.
- d6c6, d6c5, d6d5, d6c5: All move away from the kingside pawns.

Pawn moves:
- h2h3, g2g3, f2f3: Slow, but safe.
- h2h4, g2g4, f2f4: Advance pawns faster, but could leave weaknesses if Black had pieces, but here Black has only a king.

Best plan: Start advancing the pawns. The king is already well placed to support their advance and cut off the Black king.

Between the pawn moves, f2f4 is the most direct, as it allows the king to support the pawns and keeps the option to bring the king to f6/g5 if needed.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f2f4
```

2025-06-22 01:53:33,725 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.40s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King (d6), pawns (f4, g2, h2)  
- Black: King (b7)

**Position:**  
- White's king is very active, deep in Black's territory.
- White has a kingside pawn majority (three pawns vs. zero).
- Black's king is on b7, far from the kingside pawns.
- White can start pushing kingside pawns, but must avoid stalemating Black's king or allowing counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f4-f5:** Start pushing the kingside pawns. Black's king is too far to stop them.
2. **h2-h4/h2-h3/g2-g3/g2-g4:** Also possible, but f5 is more direct.
3. **King moves:** d6-e7, d6-d7, d6-e6, d6-e5, d6-d5, d6-c5. But the king is already optimally placed to support pawn advances.

**Risks:**  
- No immediate stalemate threats.
- Black's king is too far to interfere.

**Best plan:**  
- Push f-pawn (f4-f5), then g2-g4, h2-h4, and create a passed pawn. The king can support the advance if needed.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to push the f-pawn, starting the march to promotion.

2025-06-22 01:53:38,375 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.91s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on d6, pawn on f5, pawns on g2, h2
- Black: King on c8

**Material:** White has 3 pawns vs Black's lone king. White is completely winning, but must avoid stalemates and play accurately.

**Immediate plan:** 
- Advance the f-pawn, supported by the king, to promote.
- Avoid stalemating the black king (especially if it is forced to the a-file or b-file).
- Keep the king close to support pawn promotion and to prevent the black king from blocking the pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. f5-f6: Advance the f-pawn, threatening f7 and f8=Q.
2. d6-e7: Centralize the king, but doesn't immediately help the pawn.
3. h2-h3, g2-g3, h2-h4, g2-g4: Advance side pawns, but not urgent.

**Best move:**
- f5-f6 is the most direct. Black's king is too far to stop the f-pawn. After f6, White can play Ke7, f7, and f8=Q. There is no stalemate risk yet.

**Check for stalemate:**
- After f6, Black's king has c8, b8, b7, c7, so not stalemated.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to push the f-pawn.

2025-06-22 01:53:44,175 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.22s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on d6, pawn on f6, pawns on g2 and h2.
- Black: King on d8.

It's White to move.

**Material:** White is up a pawn and has a passed pawn on f6, which is very close to queening. Black's king is cut off on the back rank.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f6-f7**: This is the most direct threat. If Black plays ...Kc8, then f8=Q is unstoppable. If Black plays ...Kd7, then f8=Q+.
2. **King moves**: d6-e6, d6-c6, d6-e5, d6-d5, d6-c5. These don't seem as urgent as pushing the pawn.
3. **Pawn moves**: h2-h3, g2-g3, h2-h4, g2-g4. These are slow and don't contribute to the immediate plan.

**Calculation after f7:**
- 1. f7 Kc8 (only move to stay near the pawn)
- 2. f8=Q+ Kb7 (or Kd7) and White is easily winning with the extra queen.

**Is there any danger?**
- No, Black's king is too far to stop the pawn, and there are no counterplay chances.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to push the pawn.

2025-06-22 01:53:49,703 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.01s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on d6, pawn on f7, pawns on g2, h2  
Black: King on c8

It's White to move. The most forcing move is to promote the pawn on f7. Let's check if Black can stop mate or draw after that.

Candidate moves:
1. f7-f8=Q (or R, B, N)
2. King moves (not useful, as the pawn is ready to promote)
3. Pawn moves (g2, h2) - not urgent

Let's analyze f7-f8=Q:
- f7f8q: White gets a queen. Black's king is on c8, White's king is on d6, so the Black king is boxed in.
- After f7f8q, Black has no checks, and White threatens Qc7# or Qe7# mate.

Is there any stalemate risk? After f7f8q, Black's king is on c8, and has c7, d7, b7, b8 as escape squares, but all are covered by White's king and queen. But after f7f8q, Black to move, only has the king, but it's not stalemate because the king can move to b8.

Therefore, promoting to a queen is the fastest win.

Promoting to a rook also wins, but is slower.

Promoting to a knight or bishop is unnecessary.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f7f8q

2025-06-22 01:53:54,100 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.91s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on d6, Queen on f8, pawns on g2, h2
- Black: King on b7

It's White to move. Black's king is on b7, and White's queen is on f8, which means the Black king is cut off from the c-file and a-file by the queen. The White king is very close and can help with the checkmate.

Let's look for the fastest checkmate:

Candidate moves:
1. Qf8a8+ (forces the king to a8 or b6)
2. Qf8b8+ (forces the king to a7 or c6)
3. Qf8e7+ (forces the king to a8 or b8)
4. Qf8g7 (quiet move, but not forcing)
5. King moves (but queen moves are more forcing)

Let's check Qf8a8+:
- 1. Qf8a8+ Kxa8 (only move)
- 2. Kc7# (checkmate)

So, Qf8a8+ is a forced mate in 2.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f8a8
```

2025-06-22 01:53:58,469 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.64s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on d6, pawns on g2, h2
- Black: King on a8

**Material:** White has a king and two pawns vs Black's lone king.

**Objective:** The win is trivial with proper technique. The plan is to advance the pawns, use the king to support them, and promote one to a queen.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. h2-h4: Start advancing the h-pawn.
2. g2-g4: Start advancing the g-pawn.
3. h2-h3 or g2-g3: Slow, but keeps options open.
4. King moves: d6-e7, d6-d7, etc. But the king is already optimally placed to support the pawns.

**Best plan:** Advance the h-pawn. The king is already cutting off the black king from the action. Advancing the h-pawn is slightly better than the g-pawn, as it keeps the pawns separated, making it harder for the black king to blockade both.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to start advancing the h-pawn.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on d6, pawns on h4, g2
- Black: King on b8

It's White's move.

**Objective:** 
- White is up two pawns and has a king much closer to the center and queenside. Black's king is stuck on b8, so White can win by advancing the kingside pawns and promoting one.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h4-h5: Start pushing the h-pawn.
2. g2-g3: Prepare to push the g-pawn.
3. g2-g4: Immediate push, but h4-h5 is more flexible.
4. King moves: d6-e7, d6-d7, d6-e6, d6-c6, d6-e5, d6-d5, d6-c5. But the king is already ideally placed to support the pawn advance.

**Analysis:**
- The king is optimally placed to stop any Black counterplay and can support the pawns if needed.
- Advancing the h-pawn is safe and strong. Black's king is too far to stop the pawns.

**Best move:** 
Push the h-pawn to h5, starting the march to promotion.

2025-06-22 01:54:07,478 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.76s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

White: King on d6, pawns on h5 and g2  
Black: King on c8

It's White to move.

**Material:** White is up two pawns in a king and pawn endgame. The Black king is far from the kingside pawns.

**Plan:** 
- The White king is ideally placed to shepherd the pawns.
- The h5 pawn is ready to advance.
- Black's king is too far to stop the h-pawn.
- Advancing the h-pawn is the most direct way to win.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h5-h6: Pushes the passed pawn, threatening h7-h8=Q.
2. g2-g3: Prepares to support the h-pawn, but slower.
3. King moves: Not urgent, as the king is already well placed.

**Calculation:**
- After h5-h6, Black cannot stop the pawn from queening.
- If Black tries to approach with Kd8, White plays h7, and then h8=Q.
- The Black king is too far to stop the pawn.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to push the h-pawn.

2025-06-22 01:54:11,974 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.85s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on d6, pawn on h6, pawn on g2  
Black: King on b7

It's White to move.

**Immediate considerations:**
- White is up a pawn, and the h6 pawn is very advanced.
- Black's king is far from the h-pawn and cannot stop it directly.
- White's king is central and can support the advance of the h-pawn or help with the g-pawn.
- Black has no pawns and cannot create any threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h6-h7: Push the passed pawn. After h7, next move is h8=Q unless Black can stop it.
2. King moves (d6e7, d6d7, d6e6, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5): Centralizing or moving toward the queenside, but the h-pawn is the main focus.
3. g2-g3 or g2-g4: Advancing the g-pawn, but not urgent.

**Critical calculation:**
- After h6-h7, Black cannot stop h8=Q. The Black king is too far away.
- After h7, Black has no checks or threats.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to push the h-pawn.

Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on d6, pawn on h7, pawn on g2
- Black: King on b8

It's White to move. The h7 pawn is one step from promotion, and Black's king is far away, unable to stop it. Promoting to a queen is the most straightforward and decisive way to win, as Black cannot create any counterplay.

Among the promotion options (h7h8q, h7h8r, h7h8b, h7h8n), promoting to a queen (h7h8q) is the most powerful, as it gives the greatest chance to checkmate quickly and efficiently.

Therefore, the best move is:

h7h8q

Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on d6, Queen on h8, pawn on g2
- Black: King on a7

It's White to move.

The Black king is on the edge of the board, and White's queen and king are well placed to force mate. Let's look for a forced checkmate.

Candidate moves:
1. Qh8-a1+ (forces the king to the b6 square)
2. Qh8-g7 (cuts off the king's escape squares)
3. Qh8-h7 (no check, but keeps control)
4. Qh8-h1 (no check)
5. King moves (not forcing)
6. Pawn moves (not forcing)

Let's check Qa1+:

1. Qh8a1+ Ka6 (only move)
2. Qa1-a8# is checkmate.

So, Qa1+ leads to forced mate in 2.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h8a1
```

2025-06-22 01:54:24,296 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.13s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on d6, Queen on a1, Pawn on g2
- Black: King on b8

Material: White is up a queen and a pawn, Black has only the king.

Objective: Press for a swift checkmate, avoid stalemate, and ensure Black's king has at least one legal move until mate is forced.

Immediate checks:
- Qa8+ forces the king to a7, but then Qa8-a8 is not mate, as the king can escape to b7.
- Qa1-h8+ is a check, king must go to a7, but then queen can't deliver mate immediately.
- Qa1-e5+ is a check, king must go to c8 or a7.

But let's check for stalemate traps: If we play Qa1-a8, the king is not stalemated, as it can move to c7 or c8.

But the best approach is to bring the queen closer to the king, cut off escape squares, and coordinate with the king.

Candidate moves:
1. Qa1-e5+ (forces the king to c8 or a7)
2. Qa1-h8+ (forces the king to a7)
3. Qa1-a8 (cuts off the king, but not a check)
4. King moves (but queen moves are more forcing)

Let's calculate Qa1-e5+:
- ...Kb7 (only move)
- Then Qb5+ (forces Kc8 or Ka7)
- If ...Kc8, then Qb6 (mate in 1)
- If ...Ka7, then Qb7# (mate)

But after Qa1-e5+, Black's only move is Kc8 or Ka7 (since b7 is covered by the queen).

Let's check Qa1-e5+ Kc8:
- Qc7# is mate.

So, Qa1-e5+ is a forcing move that leads to mate in one on the next move.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
a1e5
```

2025-06-22 01:54:30,341 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.58s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on d6, Queen on e5, Pawn on g2  
Black: King on b7

It's White to move.

**Immediate threats and goals:**
- Black's king is on b7, with no pawns or pieces to defend.
- White's king is very close and can help in the mate.
- White's queen can cut off escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe5c7+** (not listed, but let's check): Not legal, as c7 is not in the legal moves.
2. **Qe5e7+**: This is a check. Black's king can only go to a8 or c8 (but c8 is not available), so only a8.
3. **Qe5e8+**: This is also a check, but Black can go to a7 or c7 (but c7 is not available), so only a7.
4. **Qe5g7+**: This is a check, but Black can go to a8 or c8 (but c8 is not available), so only a8.
5. **Qe5b2**: This is not a check, but it cuts off the b-file.
6. **King moves**: d6e7, d6d7, d6e6, d6d5, d6c5. These are not checks and do not threaten mate immediately.

**Let's check for forced mate:**

If 1. Qe5e7+ Ka8 (only move)
Then 2. Kc6 (threatening mate with Qb7#)
But Black has no moves, so let's see:

1. Qe5e7+ Ka8
2. Kc6 (threatening mate)
Black to move, but has no legal moves except Ka7, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, let's try 1. Qe5e8 (check)
If 1... Ka7, then 2. Kc6 (threatening mate)
If 1... Kc7, not possible.

Alternatively, let's try 1. Qe5b5+ (not legal), so not possible.

**Let's try Qe5e7+**

1. Qe5e7+ Ka8 (only move)
2. Kc6 (threatening mate with Qb7#)
Black to move, but has no legal moves.

So, 1. Qe5e7+ is a forcing move.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e5e7
```
