2025-06-22 12:57:30,448 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 3.54s):
Let's analyze the position:

White has played 1. Nc3, developing the queen's knight early. This is a flexible move, controlling the center (d5, e4) and opening lines for the bishop and queen. Black has all standard opening options.

Candidate moves:
1. ...d5 – Classical center control, opens lines for the light-squared bishop and queen.
2. ...e5 – Also classical, but allows Nc3 to pressure e5.
3. ...Nf6 – Develops a knight, standard move.
4. ...Nc6 – Develops a knight, but blocks the c-pawn.
5. ...c5 – Immediate queenside space, but less common.
6. ...g6 – Prepares kingside fianchetto.

Best move:
- 1...d5 is the most principled, contesting the center and not committing the kingside pieces yet. It also keeps options open for both bishops and doesn't block the c8 bishop.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d7d5

2025-06-22 12:58:15,299 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.51s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1. Nc3 d5 2. h4**

- White has played an early h4, which is aggressive and slightly weakening on the kingside.
- Black to move. The center is contested, and White's Nc3 supports the center and eyes d5/e4.
- White's h4 is not immediately threatening, but could become dangerous if White pushes h5 and opens the h-file.
- Black should focus on solid development, contesting the center, and not allowing White easy play on the kingside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...d4 — Pushes the pawn, gaining space and forcing the knight to move. But after Nc3-e2, White can reroute the knight.
2. ...Nf6 — Develops a piece, controls the center, and prepares to castle.
3. ...e5 — Immediately challenges the center, but after exd5, Qxd5, Nf3, White develops with tempo.
4. ...c6 — Supports the d5 pawn, preparing Nf6 and possibly d4 later.
5. ...h5 — Meets h4 with h5, stopping h5 from White, but this can also weaken Black's kingside.
6. ...Bf5 — Develops the bishop outside the pawn chain, but White can play d3 and e4 later.

**Deeper analysis:**
- ...d4 is a thematic move, but White can play Ne2, and Black's center is strong.
- ...Nf6 is flexible, develops a piece, and doesn't commit the center yet.
- ...e5 is playable, but after exd5, Qxd5, Nc3, White develops with tempo.
- ...c6 is solid, but passive.
- ...h5 is committal and may not be necessary yet.

**Best move:**
- ...d4 is the most challenging, gaining space and forcing White's knight to move. It also discourages e4 from White, and Black can develop pieces behind the pawn chain.

**Final move:**
```
d5d4

Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1. Nc3 d5 2. h4 d4 3. Nb5**

- White's knight on b5 attacks the c7 pawn and puts pressure on the queenside.
- White's pawn on h4 is aggressive, possibly preparing h5.
- Black's pawn on d4 is advanced, cramping White's center.
- Black's development is behind; none of the kingside pieces are out.
- The c7 pawn is under attack, so we must address this threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a6** – Attacks the knight on b5, forcing it to decide.
2. **Na6** – Develops a piece and defends c7.
3. **c6** – Attacks the knight and supports d4.
4. **Nc6** – Develops a piece, defends c7, and supports d4.
5. **Qd7** – Defends c7.
6. **e5** – Opens the center, but c7 is still hanging.

**Critical analysis:**
- **a6**: If 4. Nxd4, then e5 attacks the knight, but White can play Nf3. If 4. Na3, Black can continue development.
- **Nc6**: Defends c7 and develops a piece. If 4. Nf3, Black can play e5 or Bg4.
- **c6**: If 4. Nxd4, Qxd4, and Black is fine. If 4. Na3, cxb5, and Black wins a piece.
- **Na6**: Not as active as Nc6.

**Best move:**
- **Nc6** is the most solid, defending c7, developing a piece, and supporting the center.

**Final move:**

2025-06-22 13:00:02,895 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.96s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

FEN: r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/1N6/3p1P1P/8/PPPPP1P1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4

White's last move was f4, aggressively supporting the h4 pawn and opening the f-file. White has a knight on b5, which is pressuring c7 and d4. Black has a pawn on d4, which is advanced and restricts White's center, but could become a target. The knight on c6 is well-placed, and Black's development is otherwise standard.

Let's consider the candidate moves:

1. **g8f6**: Develops a knight, attacks the h4 pawn, and supports the center.
2. **g8h6**: Develops the knight, but to a less active square.
3. **e7e5**: Opens the center, but White can play fxe5, and after Nxe5, White can play fxe5, Nxe5, d3, and Black's center collapses.
4. **a7a6**: Attacks the knight on b5, but after Na3 or Nc3, White keeps the knight active.
5. **d8d5**: Centralizes the queen, but exposes it to attack.
6. **c8g4**: Develops the bishop, pins the knight, but White can play Be2.
7. **d4d3**: Advances the pawn, but White can play Bxd3, gaining a tempo.
8. **a7a5**: Attacks the knight, but doesn't develop.
9. **c6b4**: Attacks the queen's side, but the knight is not well placed there.

The most natural move is **g8f6**, developing the knight, attacking h4, and preparing to castle. It also supports the center and keeps options open.

Let's check for tactics:
- Is there any immediate threat from White? Not really, but White could play f5 or Nf3, increasing pressure.
- Is there a better move? a6 is tempting, but after Na3, White's knight is still in the game and Black hasn't developed.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8f6
```

2025-06-22 13:01:08,852 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.33s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 5. Kf2:**

- White's king is exposed on f2, which is highly unusual and dangerous in the opening.
- White's queenside knight is on b5, and the h4 pawn is advanced.
- Black has a strong center with a pawn on d4, knights on c6 and f6, and all minor pieces developed except the light-squared bishop.
- Black's king is still on e8, and castling is possible.
- White's f4 pawn is advanced, but this also weakens the e4 and g4 squares.
- The d1 bishop and g1 knight are undeveloped for White.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The d4 pawn is strong, cramping White.
- White's king is vulnerable on f2.
- Black can develop with tempo, possibly with ...Ng4+ or ...Ne4+ ideas.
- The c6 knight is attacking the b4 and a5 squares, but the b5 knight is not threatening anything immediate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Ng4+ (f6g4): Immediate check, forcing White's king to move or block with the knight.
2. ...Ne4+ (f6e4): Check, but White can block with the knight or bishop.
3. ...a6: Attack the b5 knight.
4. ...e5: Open the center, but the king is still in the center.
5. ...Bg4: Pin the knight, but White's knight is still on g1.
6. ...d3: Advance the pawn, but White can play Bxd3.

**Let's calculate ...Ng4+ (f6g4):**
- 1...Ng4+ 2. Ke1 (only move, as Kg3 is met by ...h5 trapping the king)
- After 2. Ke1, Black can play ...a6, attacking the b5 knight, or ...e5, opening the center.
- If 2. Kg3, then ...h5 traps the king.

**Let's calculate ...Ne4+ (f6e4):**
- 1...Ne4+ 2. Ke1 (again, only move), then ...a6, but the knight on e4 is not as threatening.

**Let's calculate ...a6:**
- 1...a6 2. Na3 (or Nc3), but this does not exploit the king's position.

**Let's calculate ...d3:**
- 1...d3 2. Bxd3, White develops.

**Best move:**
- ...Ng4+ is the most forcing and exploits the exposed king. After ...Ng4+, White's king is forced to e1, and Black can continue to develop with tempo or open the center.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f6g4
```

- White's knight on b5 attacks c7 and d4.
- Black's d4 pawn cramps White's position.
- Black's c6 knight supports d4 and can jump to b4 or a5.
- White's h4 pawn is advanced, but not immediately threatening.
- Black's development is lagging a bit (bishop and queen's rook), but White's king is awkward.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4-d3**: Pushes the pawn, threatening d2+ and opening lines.
2. **a7-a6**: Kicks the knight on b5.
3. **e7-e5**: Opens the center, but White's king is on e1.
4. **g4-e3**: Knight fork, but f2 is empty, so not a fork.
5. **c8-f5**: Develops bishop, attacks c2.
6. **h7-h5**: Supports the knight, but not urgent.
7. **d8-d5**: Centralizes queen, but could be exposed.

**Critical lines:**

- **d3**: If 7. exd3, then a6 wins the knight, but White can play Nc3.
- **a6**: If 7. Nc3, then dxc3, bxc3, and Black has a passed pawn.
- **g4-e3**: Not effective, as it doesn't threaten anything immediate.

**Best move:**

- **a7-a6**: Kicks the knight, and if it retreats, d3 is even stronger. If Nc3, then dxc3, bxc3, and Black has a strong passed pawn and White's king is still exposed.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-22 13:02:43,564 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.50s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Nc3):**
- Black to move.
- White's king is on e1, not yet castled, and somewhat exposed.
- Black's knight is aggressively placed on g4, eyeing e3 and f2.
- Black's pawn on d4 is advanced and restricts White's pieces.
- White's h4 pawn is hanging and overextended.
- Black's c6 knight is well-placed, and the bishop on c8 is ready to develop.
- White's queenside is undeveloped, and the king is still in the center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4xc3** (pawn takes knight): This wins a piece immediately. White's only recapture is d2xc3, after which Black is up a piece.
2. **g4e3** (knight fork): This forks the queen and rook, but White can play dxe3, so not effective.
3. **g4f2** (knight check): King moves to f2 or e2, but no follow-up.
4. **c8g4** (bishop pin): Not possible, h5 is not available.
5. **e7e5** (open center): Not urgent, as we can win material.
6. **h7h5** (attack h4): Not urgent, as we can win material.

**Tactical check:**
- The move **d4xc3** wins a piece outright, as White cannot recapture with a piece (only with a pawn), and Black will be up a knight.

**Blunder check:**
- After d4xc3, White can play d2xc3, but Black is simply up a piece.
- No immediate counterplay for White.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the knight with the d4 pawn.

2025-06-22 13:03:26,479 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.92s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 10 moves (Black to move):**
- White king is on e1, unable to castle.
- Black's knight is on g4, attacking h2 and f2.
- Black's c3 pawn is advanced and supported.
- White's h4 pawn is advanced, but Black's knight on g4 is not under threat.
- White's queenside is undeveloped, and the king is exposed.
- Black's development is good, but the king is still in the center.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The knight on g4 is threatening to jump to e3 or h2, forking or attacking.
- The c3 pawn is a thorn in White's position.
- White's king is exposed and cannot castle.
- Black can consider moves like ...Qd4, ...Qd6, or ...Qd7 to bring the queen into play, possibly threatening ...Qd4+.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qd4**: Immediate check, but White can block with e3 or Nf3.
2. **Qd6**: Prepares ...Qd4+ and supports c3.
3. **Qd7**: Similar idea, but less direct.
4. **e5**: Opens the center, but White's king is exposed.
5. **h5**: Supports the knight, but not urgent.
6. **Nf2**: Forks the rook and threatens e4, but White can play Kxf2.
7. **Nd4**: Centralizes the knight, but not forcing.
8. **cxb2**: Captures a pawn, but White can recapture with the rook.

**Tactical calculation:**
- **Qd4**: 1...Qd4 2.e3 (or Nf3) Qf2# is not possible because the king is on e1, not f1.
- **Nf2**: 1...Nf2 2.Kxf2 Qd4+ 3.Ke1 cxb2 wins material, but White can play Bxb2.
- **cxb2**: 1...cxb2 2.Bxb2 (or Rb1) and Black's pawn is gone, but White's king is still exposed.

**Best plan:**
- The move ...Qd4+ is very strong, as it forces White to block with e3 or Nf3, and then Black can continue development or increase pressure.
- Alternatively, ...Qd6 prepares ...Qd4+ and keeps options open.

**Final calculation:**
- 1...Qd4 2.e3 (forced) Qe4 (threatening Qxc2 and Qg2#) 3.Nf3 Qxf3 4.gxf3 Nf6 and Black is much better.
- 1...Qd4 2.Nf3 Qf2# is not possible because the king is on e1.

**Conclusion:**
The move ...Qd4+ is the most forcing and puts immediate pressure on White's exposed king.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-22 13:03:55,368 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.12s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after move history:**
- White king is on e1, unable to castle.
- Black's queen is very active on d4, threatening multiple checks and attacks.
- Black's knight is on g4, aggressively placed.
- Black's bishop is still on c8, not yet developed.
- White's king is exposed, and White's queenside is undeveloped.
- Black to move.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- Black's queen on d4 can check on f2, e3, f4, g1, etc.
- The knight on g4 can jump to e3, f2, h2, or h6.
- White's king is on e1, and White's bishop is on c1, blocking the rook.
- White's h4 pawn is hanging, but not immediately relevant.
- Black's c3 pawn is advanced, but not under threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qf2+**: Immediate check, forces White's king to d2 or d1 (since Kd1 walks into Ne3+ fork).
2. **Qf4**: Threatens mate on f2, but White can defend with Nf3.
3. **Ne3**: Forks queen and rook, but White's queen is not on e1.
4. **Qf6**: Retreat, not aggressive.
5. **Qe3**: Check, but White can block with Be2.
6. **Qf2+**: Let's analyze this in detail.

**Analyzing 1... Qf2+:**
- 1... Qf2+ 2. Kd1 (if Kd2, then Qe3+ and White is in trouble)
- 2... Ne3+ forks king and rook, and after Bxe3, Qxe3, Black wins a rook.
- If 2. Kd2, then Qe3+ 3. Ke1 Qf2+ and it's a perpetual, but let's see if there is more.

**Analyzing 1... Qf2+ 2. Kd1 Ne3+ 3. Bxe3 Qxe3:**
- Black wins the rook on a1 next move, and White's king is still exposed.

**Is there a mate?**
- After 1... Qf2+ 2. Kd1 Ne3+ 3. Bxe3 Qxe3, White's king is on d1, and Black threatens Qxa1+ and Qxb2.
- White is completely lost.

**Is there a better move?**
- 1... Qf2+ is the most forcing and wins material.

**Final move:**
```
d4f2
```
