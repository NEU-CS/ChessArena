2025-06-22 11:20:48,018 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 3.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

White has played 1.e3, which is a flexible move, opening lines for the bishop and queen, but is less ambitious than 1.e4 or 1.d4. As Black, I have a wide range of options. The main goals are to contest the center, develop pieces efficiently, and avoid passive positions.

Candidate moves:
1. ...e5 – Occupies the center, classical response.
2. ...d5 – Another central thrust, solid and flexible.
3. ...Nf6 – Develops a knight, attacks e4 square.
4. ...c5 – Aiming for a Sicilian-like setup.
5. ...c6 – Prepares d5, Caro-Kann style.
6. ...g6 – Prepares kingside fianchetto.

Of these, ...e5 and ...d5 are the most direct and classical. ...Nf6 is also a good developing move, but White's e3 doesn't threaten e4 immediately, so I can claim the center first.

Between ...e5 and ...d5, both are good, but ...e5 is slightly more ambitious, taking more space and preparing for rapid development.

Therefore, my move is:
```
e7e5
```

2025-06-22 11:21:21,959 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 3.73s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: 
- Has played e3 and Nf3, developing the kingside and preparing to develop the dark-squared bishop.
- No immediate threats, but White is ready to play d4 or Nc3.

Black:
- Has played e5, controlling the center.
- It's Black's turn to develop a piece or continue with central play.

Candidate moves:
1. **b8c6**: Develops the knight, supports e5, and prepares for ...d5.
2. **g8f6**: Develops the kingside knight, attacks e4, and prepares for kingside castling.
3. **d7d5**: Immediate central challenge, but White can respond with Nxe5.
4. **f8c5**: Develops the bishop to an active square, eyes f2.
5. **e5e4**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play Nd4 or Ng1.

Of these, **g8f6** is the most natural, developing a piece, attacking e4, and preparing to castle. **b8c6** is also good, but developing the kingside first is generally preferable for rapid castling and flexibility.

Let's check for tactics:
- After ...Nf6, if Nxe5, then ...d6 wins back the pawn.
- No immediate threats from White.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8f6
```

2025-06-22 11:22:04,457 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.66s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 1.e3 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nf3-h4**

White's knight on h4 is a bit awkward, possibly aiming for f5 or g6, but currently not threatening anything immediate. Black has a solid center and normal development options.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d7-d5**: Grabbing the center, but White can play d4 and challenge.
2. **d7-d6**: Solid, but passive.
3. **b8-c6**: Developing a piece, natural.
4. **f8-e7**: Prepares to castle, but blocks the queen.
5. **g7-g6**: Prepares to fianchetto, but weakens dark squares and could be targeted by White's knight.
6. **h7-h6**: Kicks the knight, but after Nf5 White gets a strong outpost.
7. **e5-e4**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play d3 and the knight on h4 is not really trapped.
8. **f6-g4**: Attacks the knight on h4, but White can play Nf3 back or Qxg4 if exchanged.

**Critical lines:**
- After **h7-h6**, White can play Nf5, and after d5, Nxg7+ Bxg7, d4, Black is fine but White has some initiative.
- After **b8-c6**, Black develops naturally and can follow up with d5 or Be7, O-O.
- **e5-e4** is tempting, but after g3, White can challenge the center and the knight on h4 is not trapped.

**Best move:**
Developing a piece is generally best unless there is a tactical reason not to. **b8-c6** develops the knight, supports the e5 pawn, and prepares for d5. It also keeps options open and doesn't create weaknesses.

**Final move:**
```
b8c6

2025-06-22 11:22:51,725 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.85s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 4.g4:**
- White has played aggressively with 4.g4, attacking the knight on f6 and preparing to expand on the kingside.
- White's knight is on h4, which is a bit awkward but eyes f5 and g6.
- Black's pieces are well developed: knights on f6 and c6, bishop on f8, and all pawns intact.
- Black to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **...d5**: Strikes in the center, but White can play g5, attacking the knight on f6.
2. **...h5**: Immediately challenges the knight on h4 and the pawn on g4. If White plays g5, then ...Ng4 is possible, attacking the queen and threatening ...Qxg5.
3. **...Nxg4**: Not possible, as the knight is protected by the queen.
4. **...g5**: Kicks the knight on h4, but White can play Nf5, attacking the bishop on c8 and threatening to jump to g7.
5. **...e4**: Pushes in the center, attacking the knight on h4. White can respond with g5, and after ...Nd5, White can play Qxg4.
6. **...d6**: Solid, but not challenging White's aggressive setup.
7. **...h6**: Prepares ...g5, but White can play Nf5.
8. **...Be7**: Develops a piece, but doesn't address the kingside tension.

**Critical lines:**
- After 4...h5, if 5.g5, then 5...Ng4 attacks the queen and threatens ...Qxg5.
- If 5.Nf5, then ...hxg4 is possible, and Black gets the g-file open.

**Calculation:**
- 4...h5 5.g5 Nxg4? 6.Qxg4 hxg4 7.Ng2 (threatening Nf4), but Black has the open h-file.
- 4...h5 5.g5 Ng4 6.f3 Qxg5 7.fxg4 Qxh4+ 8.Ke2 Qxg4+ and Black is winning.

**Conclusion:**
The move 4...h5 is the most aggressive and challenges White's kingside expansion immediately, opening lines for attack and exploiting White's overextension.

My move:
```
h7h5

2025-06-22 11:23:41,311 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.34s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 5. Bc4:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1/h1, Bishop on c4, Knight on h4, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e3, f2, g4, h2
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8/h8, Bishop on c8, Knight on f6/c6, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e5, f7, g7, h5

**White's threats:**
- White is trying to build up kingside pressure with g4/h4, and the bishop on c4 eyes f7.
- The knight on h4 is awkward but could jump to f5 or g6 if Black is careless.

**Black's plans:**
- Black has a strong center and a lead in development.
- White's kingside is overextended and underdeveloped.
- Black can consider ...d5 to challenge the center, ...Nxg4 to grab a pawn, or ...d6 to develop safely.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h5g4**: Grabs a pawn, but after h4g6, fxg6, White gets some play on the kingside.
2. **f8e7**: Develops, but passive.
3. **d7d5**: Strikes in the center, but e4 is not possible for White immediately.
4. **f6g4**: Sacrifices a knight for two pawns and opens the h-file, but White's attack is not yet dangerous.
5. **g7g6**: Reinforces h5, but weakens dark squares.
6. **f6g8**: Retreats, but passive.
7. **e5e4**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play d3 or Nf5.

**Critical calculation:**
- After **h5g4**, if White plays h4g6, fxg6, Qxg4, d5, Qxg6+, Ke7, Qg7+, Kd6, Qxg6+ Kc5, White is not mating, and Black is up material.
- After **d7d5**, White can play Bb5, pinning the knight, but Black can play Nxg4, and after Qxg4, Bxg4, f3, Qxh4+, Black is better.

**Best move:**
- **h5g4** is the most direct, grabbing a pawn and opening the h-file. White's attack is not yet dangerous, and Black can consolidate.

Final move:
```
h5g4
```

2025-06-22 11:24:42,598 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.92s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 6... (Black to move):**
- White's last move was b3, supporting the c4 bishop and possibly preparing Bb2.
- White's knight on h4 is awkward but is eyeing f5 and g6 squares.
- Black's g4 pawn is advanced, but White's kingside is underdeveloped and the king is still in the center.
- Black's knight on f6 is well-placed, and the c6 knight is controlling central squares.
- Black's light-squared bishop and queen are still undeveloped.
- Black's king is still in the center, but White's king is also not yet castled.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The g4 pawn is under no immediate threat.
- White's knight on h4 could jump to f5, but Black can respond.
- Black can develop with tempo by playing d5 or d6, or develop the bishop.
- Black can consider g5 to kick the h4 knight, but White can play Nf5, attacking g7 and e7.
- e4 is possible, but White can play Bb2, and the position opens up.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d5**: Strikes in the center, but White can play Bb5 pinning the knight, or Bf1 to reinforce.
2. **d6**: Solid, supports e5, opens the bishop.
3. **g5**: Kicks the knight, but Nf5 is strong for White.
4. **Be7**: Develops, prepares to castle.
5. **d5**: If exd5, Nxd5, but White can play Nc3.
6. **g6**: Prepares to fianchetto, but slow.
7. **a6**: Prepares b5, but slow.
8. **e4**: Aggressive, but White can play Bb2.

**Tactical check:**
- If 6...g5 7.Nf5 d5, White can play Bb5, pinning the knight.
- If 6...d5 7.Bb5, pinning the knight, but Black can play Qd6 or Bd7.
- If 6...Be7, White can play Nf5, attacking g7 and e7.

**Best move:**
- **d5** is the most principled, striking in the center, opening lines for the bishop, and challenging White's central control. If White plays Bb5, Black can play Qd6 or Bd7, and the center is solid. If White exchanges, Black's pieces become active.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d7d5
```

2025-06-22 11:25:54,470 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.98s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 10. O-O:**
- White: King is castled, pieces are active, especially the bishop on c4 and the knight on h4. The pawn on g4 is advanced, and White threatens to open the kingside.
- Black: King is still in the center, but can castle kingside. The knight on f6 is attacked by the h4 knight. The center is tense, and Black has a space advantage in the center, but must be careful about kingside safety.

**Immediate threats:**
- White threatens to play f4, opening the f-file and attacking the e5 pawn.
- The knight on h4 eyes f5 and g6 squares.
- Black's king is still in the center, so castling is a priority.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h8g8 (O-O):** Castling kingside, securing the king and connecting the rooks. This is the most natural move, but let's check for tactics.
2. **d5c4:** Captures the bishop, but after bxc4, White has a strong center and open b-file.
3. **d5d4:** Pushes the pawn, attacking the bishop, but White can play f4, and the center opens with Black's king still in the center.
4. **g4g3:** Pushes the pawn, but White can ignore it or play fxg3, opening the f-file.
5. **f6g8:** Retreats the knight, but loses a tempo and doesn't address the king's safety.

**Tactical check:**
- After castling (h8g8), if White plays f4, Black can respond with e4, closing the center and keeping the king safe.
- If White tries Nxg6, fxg6, Black is fine.
- No immediate tactics for White.

**Strategic considerations:**
- Castling is urgent to avoid being caught in the center.
- After castling, Black can consider playing d4 or e4, or even g5 to kick the knight.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to castle kingside, ensuring king safety and preparing to contest the center.

My move:
```
h8g8

2025-06-22 11:27:02,534 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.88s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 8. Qg4:**
- White's queen is aggressively placed on g4, eyeing the g7 pawn and pinning the knight on f6.
- White's king is castled, and White has a strong center and space advantage.
- Black's king is still in the center, but can castle queenside.
- Black's knight on f6 is pinned to the king by the queen on g4.
- Black's d5 pawn is attacked by the c4 bishop and the queen.
- Black's development is lagging, but there are no immediate threats of mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d5xc4**: Grabs a pawn, but White can play Qxc4, keeping the initiative.
2. **e5e4**: Kicks the queen, but Qg2 or Qh3 keeps pressure.
3. **Nxg4**: Not possible, as the knight is pinned.
4. **Be7**: Develops and prepares to castle, but doesn't address the pin.
5. **d4**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play Qf3 or Qg2.
6. **Bf5**: Develops with tempo, attacking the queen.
7. **Nxg4**: Not legal.
8. **g6**: Kicks the queen, but weakens the dark squares.
9. **Qd7**: Prepares to castle queenside.

**Critical lines:**
- If **Bf5**: Qxf5 dxc4, White can play Qf3 or Qg2, but Black has gained a tempo and can develop further.
- If **dxc4**: Qxc4, White's queen is active.
- If **e4**: Qg2, White keeps the pin.

**Best move:**
- **Bf5** stands out as it develops a piece, attacks the queen, and gains a tempo. If White exchanges queens, Black can recapture with the bishop, unpinning the knight and preparing to castle queenside.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8f5
```
2025-06-22 11:27:02,534 - WARNING - Illegal move: f8f5 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one. Note that we have give you all legal moves.

2025-06-22 11:27:08,265 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.73s):
Thank you for the correction. Let's re-evaluate the position with only the provided legal moves.

**Key points:**
- The knight on f6 is pinned by the queen on g4.
- White threatens Qxg7, which would be mate if the g8 rook wasn't there, but still dangerous.
- The d5 pawn is attacked twice (by the queen and bishop), defended once (by the knight).
- Black needs to address the pin and White's pressure on the kingside.

**Candidate moves from the legal list:**
- g8h8: Moves the rook, but doesn't address the pin or development.
- f8e7: Develops, breaks the pin, and prepares to castle queenside.
- f8d6: Develops, but blocks the d-pawn and doesn't break the pin.
- f8c5, f8b4, f8a3: Develops, but doesn't address the pin.
- e8e7: Moves the king, but doesn't develop.
- d8e7: Moves the queen, but doesn't develop.
- d8d7, d8d6: Moves the queen, but doesn't address the pin.
- c8d7, c8e6, c8f5, c8g4: Develops, but doesn't address the pin.
- a8b8: Rook move, not relevant.
- f6h7, f6d7, f6h5, f6g4, f6e4: Knight moves, but the knight is pinned and can't move.
- c6b8, c6e7, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4: Knight moves, but not urgent.
- d5c4: Captures, but loses a pawn after Qxc4.
- g7g6: Weakens dark squares, but kicks the queen.
- b7b6, a7a6, e5e4, d5d4, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5: Pawn moves.

**Most logical move:**
- **f8e7**: Develops the bishop, breaks the pin, and prepares to castle queenside. This is the safest and most solid move, addressing the main threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e7

2025-06-22 11:28:24,922 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.54s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Both sides have all major and minor pieces except Black is missing the h-pawn, White is missing the h-pawn and the f-pawn.

**King Safety:**  
- Both kings are castled kingside.  
- White's king is slightly more exposed due to the absence of the f-pawn and the advanced g4 queen.

**Piece Activity:**  
- White's queen is aggressively placed on g4, eyeing g7 and possibly the e6 square.  
- White's bishop on c4 is active, targeting f7.  
- Black's pieces are mostly developed, but the bishop on c8 is still undeveloped.  
- Black's knight on f6 is under some pressure, but not immediately threatened.

**Threats:**  
- White threatens Qxg7, which would be mate if the g8 rook wasn't there.  
- White also has pressure on the e5 pawn, but it's well-defended for now.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **d5xc4**: Captures the bishop, but White can respond with Qxg7, after which Black can play Rf8, and the queen must retreat. But after Qxg7, Rf8, White can play Kh1, threatening Rg1 and Qxg8 mate. This is dangerous.
2. **e5e4**: Attacks the bishop, but White can play Qxg7, and after Rf8, Qh6, and the threat continues.
3. **g7g6**: Defends g7, but weakens the dark squares and allows Qf3 or Qg2, keeping pressure.
4. **c8g4**: Offers a queen trade, but White can decline and keep the attack.
5. **c8e6**: Develops the bishop, blocks the e-file, and defends g7 indirectly.
6. **d8d7**: Defends g7, but is passive.
7. **f6g4**: Sacrifices the knight for the queen, but after Bxg4, White is up material.

**Deep Calculation:**
- After **d5xc4**, White plays Qxg7, Rf8, Qh6, and White threatens Qh8. Black can play Ng8, but then Qh8, Bf6, Qh3, and Black is under heavy pressure.
- After **g7g6**, White can play Qf3, keeping the pressure.
- After **c8g4**, White can play Qg3, keeping the queen on the board and pressure on e5.
- After **c8e6**, if White plays Qxg7, then Rg8, Qh6, and again, White threatens Qh8.

**Best Move:**
- **g7g6** seems to be the most solid, defending g7, and not allowing Qxg7. It does weaken the dark squares, but there is no immediate way for White to exploit that. Other moves either lose material or allow a dangerous attack.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g7g6
```

2025-06-22 11:29:25,082 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.21s):
Let's analyze the position step by step:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White has castled kingside, and Black's king is still in the center.
- White's queen and bishop are active on the kingside, and White has some initiative.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed, but Black has a strong center and potential for counterplay.
- Black's c6 knight is well-placed, and the dark-squared bishop on c8 is undeveloped.

**Immediate Threats:**
- White threatens to attack on the kingside, especially with the queen and bishop eyeing the g6 pawn and the h-file.
- Black must be careful not to allow tactics involving Qxg6 or Bxf7+.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **c8g4** (Bishop to g4): Develops the bishop, attacks the queen, and gains a tempo. However, after Qg3, White keeps the pressure.
2. **c8e6** (Bishop to e6): Develops the bishop, defends g6, and supports the center.
3. **d5c4** (Pawn takes c4): Grabs a pawn, but opens the b-file and could expose the king.
4. **d5d4**: Pushes the pawn, gaining space and attacking the bishop, but White can respond with Bb5 pinning the knight.
5. **g8h8** (King to h8): Sidesteps potential checks, but is passive and loses time.
6. **e5e4**: Pushes the pawn, attacking the knight, but White can play Qg3 or Bb5.

**Deeper Analysis:**
- **c8g4**: After Bg4, Qg3, Black can play Qd7 or Qd6 to defend g6. White may continue with f3, trying to trap the bishop, but Black can play Be6 or h5.
- **c8e6**: Solid, but White can play Bb5, pinning the knight and increasing pressure.
- **d5c4**: After bxc4, Black's center is less strong, and White's pieces become more active.
- **d5d4**: After Bb5, pinning the knight, Black's king remains in the center and could be vulnerable.
- **g8h8**: Too passive, loses time.

**Best Move:**
- **c8g4** is the most active, develops with tempo, and forces White's queen to move. After Qg3, Black can consider Qd7 or Qd6, defending g6 and preparing to castle queenside or play h5.

**Final Move:**
```
c8g4
```

2025-06-22 11:30:18,216 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.24s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White's king is castled kingside, but White's kingside pawns are somewhat loose (h2, f2).
- Black's pieces are active: the bishop on g4 pins the knight on h4, and the knight on f6 is well-placed.
- White's bishop on c4 is active, but the knight on h4 is awkward.
- Black's queen on d8 and both rooks are still on their original squares, but the position is closed enough that this isn't a huge issue yet.
- White's last move was Re2, possibly preparing to double rooks or defend e3.

**Immediate Tactical Considerations:**
- The knight on h4 is pinned by the bishop on g4.
- The e4 square is a strong outpost for Black's knight.
- The move ...e4 is possible, attacking the knight on h4 and opening the diagonal for the bishop on e7.
- The move ...d5xc4 is possible, but then White can recapture with the bishop or pawn.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. ...e4 (attacking the knight, opening the bishop, and possibly threatening ...Ne5 or ...Ng4)
2. ...d5xc4 (winning a pawn, but may allow White counterplay)
3. ...g5 (attacking the knight on h4, but weakens kingside)
4. ...Qd7 (connecting rooks)
5. ...Ne4 (jumping into the center, attacking c3 and g3)

Let's analyze the most forcing move: **...e4**

- 11...e4
    - If 12. f3, then ...exf3 13. Nxf3 (or gxf3) and Black has opened the e-file and can play ...Ne4.
    - If 12. Rd2, then ...Ne5, threatening ...Nf3+.
    - If 12. Bb5, then ...Qd6, defending the knight and preparing ...Ne5.
    - If 12. h3, then ...Bxh3 13. gxh3 Nh5, threatening ...Qxh4.

**Tactical Point:** After ...e4, the knight on h4 is under pressure, and White's kingside is vulnerable.

**Other moves:**
- ...dxc4: White can play Qxd8+ Rxd8, Bxc4, and Black has given up the center.
- ...g5: Weakens kingside, not necessary yet.
- ...Ne4: White can play f3, and the knight may be kicked.

**Conclusion:** The move ...e4 is the most aggressive and creates the most problems for White, leveraging the pin and the awkward knight on h4.

**Final Move:**
```
e5e4

2025-06-22 11:31:01,117 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.34s):
Let's analyze the position step by step:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White's last move was Ng6, attacking the bishop on e7 and threatening Nxe7+.
- Black's king is on e8, not yet castled, and White has a strong initiative.
- Black's bishop on g4 is active, pinning the knight on f3 (but White's knight is on g6 now).
- White's pieces are very active, especially the knight on g6 and the bishop on c4.
- Black's knight on f6 is attacked and pinned by the bishop on c4.
- Black's e7 bishop is attacked by the knight on g6.

**Immediate Threats:**
- Nxe7+ is a big threat, forking the king and queen.
- If Black does nothing, White will win material or get a strong attack.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. Move the king: e8-d7 or e8-f8. But after Nxe7, White wins the bishop.
2. Move the bishop: e7-f8, e7-d6, e7-c5, e7-b4, e7-a3. But after Nxe7, White wins the bishop.
3. Move the knight: f6-h7, f6-d7, f6-h5. But the knight is pinned and can't move.
4. Move the queen: d8-c8, d8-b8, d8-d7, d8-d6. But doesn't solve the threat.
5. Move the rook: g8-h8, g8-f8, g8-g7, g8-g6. Not helpful.
6. Move the bishop on g4: g4-c8, g4-d7, g4-e6, g4-h5, g4-f5, g4-h3, g4-f3, g4-e2.

**Critical Analysis:**
- The only way to avoid losing the bishop on e7 is to move the king or the bishop.
- If I play e8-d7, White plays Nxe7, and after Qxe7, Bxd5 wins a pawn and keeps the initiative.
- If I play e7-f8, White can play Nxf8, Kxf8, and then Bxd5, winning a pawn.
- If I play e7-d6, White can play Nxe7, Qxe7, Bxd5, and White is better.
- If I play g4-e2 (bishop takes rook), White can play Nxe7, Qxe7, Bxe2, and White is up the exchange.
- If I play g4-f3, White can play Nxe7, Qxe7, Bxf3, and White is up a pawn and has the initiative.
- If I play g4-h5, White can play Nxe7, Qxe7, Bxd5, and White is better.

**Best Defensive Resource:**
- The only way to avoid immediate material loss is to play g4-e2, capturing the rook. After Nxe7, Qxe7, Bxe2, Black is down the exchange but has some compensation with the bishop pair and central pawns.

**Final Move:**
After thorough analysis, the best move is to capture the rook with the bishop:

```
g4e2

2025-06-22 11:31:13,661 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.16s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White's king is on g1, Black's king on e8.
- White has a knight on g6, which is very aggressive and threatens to create tactical problems.
- Black's bishop on e7 is attacked by the knight on g6.
- White's bishop on c4 is very active, eyeing the f7 pawn and the a2-g8 diagonal.
- Black's knight on f6 is attacked by the g6 knight.
- Black's queen on d8, rook on a8, and rook on g8.
- White's last move was d4, opening the center.

**Immediate Threats:**
- White threatens Nxe7, forking the queen and rook, and possibly winning material.
- White's bishop on c4 is eyeing f7, but it's currently defended.
- Black's bishop on e7 is attacked twice (by the knight and the bishop).

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **e7f8**: Retreat bishop, but then Nxe7 Qxe7, White can play Ba3, threatening to win the rook on f8.
2. **f6h5**: Move the knight, but then Nxe7, Qxe7, White can continue with Ba3.
3. **e4d3**: Counterattack with the pawn, but White can play Nxe7, Qxe7, Bxd3, exd3, Bxd3, and White is better.
4. **d5c4**: Capture the bishop, but after bxc4, White has a strong center and the knight on g6 is still a problem.
5. **e2h5**: Move the bishop to h5, but then Nxe7, Qxe7, Ba3.
6. **f7g6**: Take the knight, but then hxg3, and White's bishop is still strong.
7. **c6a5**: Move the knight, but doesn't solve the immediate problem.
8. **e7d6**: Retreat bishop, but then Nxe7, Qxe7, Ba3.

**Critical Calculation:**
- If Black plays **f7g6** (fxg6), White can play Nxe7, Qxe7, Bxd5, and White wins a pawn and has a strong position.
- If Black plays **e7f8**, White plays Nxe7, Qxe7, Ba3, and Black's rook is trapped.
- If Black plays **e4d3**, White can play Nxe7, Qxe7, Bxd3, exd3, Bxd3, and White is up a pawn.

**Best Defensive Move:**
- The only way to avoid losing material immediately is to move the queen to d7 or d6, defending the bishop and keeping the rook protected.
- **d8d7**: Queen defends the bishop on e7, so after Nxe7, Qxe7, White doesn't have Ba3 trapping the rook.

Let's check this line:
1. d8d7
2. Nxe7 Qxe7
3. Ba3 Qd7 (or Qd8)
4. Bb5 a6
5. Bxc6 Qxc6

Black is still under pressure, but at least not losing material immediately.

**Final Decision:**
The move **d8d7** is the best defensive resource, defending the bishop and keeping the position together.

2025-06-22 11:31:23,801 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.41s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k1r1/pppqbp2/2n2nN1/3B4/3Pp3/1PP1P3/P3bP1P/RNB3K1 b q - 0 14

**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Black: Rooks (a8, g8), Queen (d7), Bishops (e2, f7), Knights (c6, f6), pawns (a7, b7, e4, f7, g7, h8)
- White: Rooks (a1, g1), Queen (none), Bishops (d5, c1), Knights (g6), pawns (a2, b3, c3, d4, e3, f2, h2), King (g1)

**Key features:**
- White's knight on g6 is very strong, attacking f8 and h8, and threatening to jump to e5 or f4.
- Black's king is on e8, not fully safe, but not under immediate threat.
- Black's bishop on e2 is active, and the queen on d7 is central.
- White's bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling key diagonals and pinning the knight on c6 if the d-pawn moves.
- Black's knight on f6 is attacked by the g6 knight and is defending e4.

**Immediate tactical threats:**
- White threatens to play Bxf7+ or Nxe7 (if possible), but neither is currently possible.
- Black's e2 bishop is attacking f1, but that's not an immediate threat.
- Black's e4 pawn is strong, but could become weak if White can attack it.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qg4** (d7g4): Attacks the knight on g6 and the bishop on d5. If White plays Bxf7+, then Kd8 is possible.
2. **Nxd5** (f6d5): Captures the strong bishop on d5, but after Nxe7, White wins material.
3. **Qh3** (d7h3): Threatens mate on h2, but White can defend with f3 or Nf4.
4. **Qf5** (d7f5): Attacks the knight on g6 and keeps pressure.
5. **Nxd4** (c6d4): Captures the pawn, but after exd4, the bishop on d5 is still strong.
6. **O-O-O** (e8c8): Castles queenside, bringing the king to safety and connecting the rooks.
7. **Bf3** (e2f3): Attacks the rook on g1, but White can respond with Nxe7 or Bxc6+.
8. **Qh3** (d7h3): Threatens mate, but White can defend.

**Critical lines:**
- If 1... Qg4, then 2. Qxg4 Nxg4 3. Bxe4 fxg6 and Black is fine.
- If 1... Nxd5, 2. Nxe7 Nxe7 3. Bxd5 Nxd5 and White is better.
- If 1... O-O-O, White can play Bxc6 Qxc6 Nxe7+ Kb8 Nxc6+ bxc6 and White is up material.

**Best move:**
- **Qg4** (d7g4) looks strong, attacking the knight and bishop, and threatening to exchange queens, which would relieve pressure.

**Double-checking Qg4:**
- 1... Qg4 2. Qxg4 Nxg4 3. Bxe4 fxg6 and Black is fine.
- 1... Qg4 2. Bxf7+ Kd8 3. Qxg4 Nxg4 4. Nxe7 Kxe7 and Black is fine.

**Is there a better move?**
- O-O-O is risky due to Bxc6.
- Nxd5 loses material.
- Qh3 is not effective.

**Final decision:** Qg4 is the best move, attacking both the knight and bishop and offering queen trade.

2025-06-22 11:31:30,895 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.58s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Kh1):**
- Black to move.
- White's king is on h1, with some pawn cover but exposed to threats along the g-file.
- Black's queen is on g4, eyeing g2 and h3.
- Black's knight on f6 is well-placed, and the other on c6.
- Black's dark-squared bishop is on e7, and White's dark-squared bishop is on d5.
- White's knight is on g6, attacking e7 and h8, but not immediately threatening mate.
- White's bishop on d5 is strong, but Black's queen and knight coordinate well.

**Tactical considerations:**
- The g2 pawn is pinned to the king.
- The queen on g4 is very active.
- The knight on g6 attacks the bishop on e7.
- Black could consider Qf3+ or Qg2+ ideas, but must watch for White's counterplay.
- The bishop on e7 is attacked by the knight on g6.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qf3+**: Immediate check, but White can block with Kg1 or Kg2.
2. **Qxg6**: Captures the knight, but then White can recapture with hxg6, opening the h-file.
3. **Qf5**: Defends e7 and keeps pressure.
4. **Qh5**: Threatens mate on h2, but White can defend with h3.
5. **Bf3+**: Bishop can't go to f3.
6. **Nxd5**: Knight captures bishop, but then White recaptures with cxd5.
7. **Qe6**: Defends e7 and keeps queen active.
8. **Qh3**: Threatens mate, but White can play Qg1.

**Critical lines:**
- If Qxg6, hxg6, then Black's attack is lessened, and White has open h-file for counterplay.
- If Qf3+, Kg1, then what? No immediate follow-up.
- If Qh5, h3, then no immediate mate.
- If Qe6, defending e7, White may try Bxe6 or Nxe7.

**Defensive needs:**
- The bishop on e7 is attacked and must be defended.
- The queen must stay active.

**Best move:**
- Qe6 seems to defend the bishop and keep the queen active.
- Alternatively, Qf5 also defends e7 and keeps pressure.

**Let's check Qe6:**
- Qe6 defends e7, keeps the queen on the kingside, and avoids exchanges.
- White has no immediate threats.

**Let's check Qf5:**
- Qf5 also defends e7, but is less central.

**Conclusion:**
- Qe6 is the most solid, defending the bishop and keeping the queen active.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-22 11:31:42,766 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.35s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White has a dangerous knight on g6 and a bishop on d5, both eyeing the kingside.
- Black's king is on e8, with castling queenside still possible.
- Black's queen is on e6, and the bishop on e2 is deep in White's camp.
- Black's knight is on c6, and the bishop on e7.
- White's king is on g1, with a pawn structure that is somewhat weakened on the kingside.
- Black has a material advantage (extra bishop for a pawn).

**Immediate Threats:**
- White threatens Nxe7, forking the king and queen.
- White's bishop on d5 is strong, but not directly threatening a mate.
- Black's queen is attacked by the bishop on d5.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qxg6**: Captures the knight, but after Bxc6+, Black's king is exposed and loses the right to castle.
2. **Qd7**: Retreats the queen, but allows Nxe7, forking king and queen.
3. **Qf5**: Retreats the queen, but again Nxe7+ is a fork.
4. **Qd6**: Retreats the queen, but Nxe7+ is still a fork.
5. **Qh3**: Retreats the queen, but Nxe7+ is a fork.
6. **Qf7**: Retreats the queen, but Nxe7+ is a fork.
7. **Qd5**: Queen takes bishop, but then Nxe7+ wins the queen.
8. **Qxg6**: Let's analyze this more deeply.

If 1... Qxg6 2. Bxc6+ bxc6 3. Qxg6 fxg6, Black is up a piece, but White has some compensation with open lines and Black's king is exposed. However, Black is still up material.

9. **Castling queenside (O-O-O)**: Let's see if this is possible.
- e8c8 is legal. After 1... O-O-O, White can play Nxe7+ Nxe7, Bxe6+ fxe6, and Black is still up a piece.

10. **Move the queen to a safe square**: But all queen moves allow Nxe7+.

**Best Move:**
- **Qxg6** is the most forcing. After Bxc6+ bxc6 Qxg6 fxg6, Black is up a piece, but White has some play.
- **Castling queenside (e8c8)** is also possible. After Nxe7+ Nxe7, Bxe6+ fxe6, Black is up a piece, but White has some compensation.

**Calculation:**
1. Qxg6 Bxc6+ bxc6 Qxg6 fxg6, Black is up a piece.
2. e8c8 Nxe7+ Nxe7 Bxe6+ fxe6, Black is up a piece.

Between these, castling queenside keeps the king safer and maintains the material advantage.

**Final Decision:**
The best move is to castle queenside, keeping the king safe and maintaining the material advantage.

2025-06-22 11:31:48,780 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.20s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (c6):**
- Black to move.
- Material: Black is up a pawn, but White has a dangerous knight on g6 and a bishop on c6, both eyeing the kingside and queenside.
- White's king is on g1, relatively safe for now.
- Black's king is on c8, with some queenside pawns and pieces for cover.
- White's threats: The knight on g6 is menacing, especially with potential sacrifices or attacks on f8/h8. The bishop on c6 is also strong, pinning the b7 pawn and controlling key diagonals.
- Black's threats: Black has a material advantage and can try to consolidate and neutralize White's activity.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f6d7**: Retreats the knight, but loses the exchange after Nxe7+.
2. **f6g4**: Attacks the bishop on e2, but White can play Nxe7+ and then Bxg4.
3. **e7d6**: Retreats the bishop, but White can play Nxe7+.
4. **e2f3**: Moves the bishop to f3, attacking the knight, but White can play Nxe7+.
5. **f7g6**: Kicks the knight, but White can play Nxe7+.
6. **e7f8**: Retreats the bishop, but White can play Nxe7+.

**Critical tactical consideration:**
- White's main threat is Nxe7+ followed by Bxg4, winning material or exposing the Black king.
- If Black plays f7g6, White can play Nxe7+ Qxe7 Bxb7+ Kb8 Qb5, and Black is in trouble.
- If Black plays e2f3, White can play Nxe7+.

**Best defensive resource:**
- The move **e2f3** attacks the knight on g6, forcing White to react. If White plays Nxe7+, then Qxe7, and after Bxf3, Black is still up material and has exchanged off a dangerous piece.

Let's check the line:
1. ... Be2f3
2. Nxe7+ Qxe7
3. Bxf3 exf3

Black is up a piece for a pawn, and the dangerous knight is gone.

**Final move:**
```
e2f3
```

2025-06-22 11:31:57,632 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.69s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2kr2r1/ppp1bp2/2B1qnN1/8/3Pp3/PPP1Pb2/5P1P/RNB3K1 b - - 0 18

**Material count:**
- Black: 2 rooks, 2 bishops, queen, 6 pawns
- White: 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight, 6 pawns

**Key features:**
- White's knight on g6 is very strong, attacking f8 and e7, and supporting the bishop on c6.
- Black's king is on c8, somewhat exposed.
- White's bishop on c6 is very powerful, pinning the f3 bishop to the king.
- Black's queen is on e6, centralized.
- Black's bishop on f3 is attacked by the pawn on f2, but currently defended by the queen.

**Threats:**
- White may try to play d5, opening the c-file and attacking the king.
- White's knight on g6 is threatening to jump to e7+ or f8.
- Black's bishop on f3 is under attack, but if it moves, the queen on e6 is vulnerable to discovered attacks.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f3g4**: Bishop takes pawn, but then White can play d5, opening the c-file.
2. **e6g4**: Queen takes pawn, but then White can play Nxe7+.
3. **f6e8**: Retreat knight to defend c7, but loses pressure.
4. **e7f8**: Retreat bishop, but loses material.
5. **f3h5**: Bishop to h5, but White can play d5.
6. **d8f8**: Defend f8 square, but White can play Nxe7+.
7. **e6g4**: Queen takes pawn, but Nxe7+ is strong.

**Critical lines:**
- If Black plays **f3g4**, White can play d5, and after Qxd5, Nxe7+ Kb8, Nxg8 Rxg8, Bxd5, White is up material.
- If Black plays **e6g4**, White plays Nxe7+ Kb8, Nxg8 Rxg8, Bxd5, again White is up material.
- If Black plays **f6e8**, White can play Nxe7+ Kb8, Nxg8 Rxg8, Bxd5, White is up material.

**Defensive move:**
- **e6d6**: Queen to d6, defending c7 and f8, and keeping an eye on the d5 break. This also keeps the bishop on f3 defended.

**Tactical alert:**
- White's Nxe7+ is a recurring threat, forking king and rook, and after Rxg8, White can capture on f3 or d5.

**Best move:**
- **e6d6**: This move defends c7, keeps the queen active, and supports the bishop on f3. It also prevents immediate d5 by White, as the queen now covers d5.

Therefore, after careful analysis, the best move is:

```
e6d6
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2krB1r1/ppp1bp2/3q1nN1/8/3Pp3/PPP1Pb2/5P1P/RNB3K1 b - - 2 19

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on c8 and g8, Bishop on e7, Queen on d6, Knight on f6, Bishop on f3, Pawns on a7, b7, c7, e4, g7, h7
- White: Rook on a1, Bishop on e8, Knight on g6, Bishop on c1, King on g1, Pawns on a3, b3, c3, d4, f2, h2

**Immediate threats:**
- White's knight on g6 is attacking the bishop on e7 and threatening to take on e7 with check.
- White's bishop on e8 is pinning the knight on f6 to the king on c8.
- White's king is relatively safe on g1.
- Black's bishop on f3 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal and attacking g2.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6g3** (Queen takes on g3): This threatens mate on g2 and wins a pawn. White cannot take the queen because the pawn is pinned by the bishop on f3.
2. **f6e8** (Knight to e8): Defends the bishop on e7 and unpins the knight.
3. **d8e8** (King to e8): Moves the king away from the pin, but is passive.
4. **e7f8** (Bishop to f8): Retreats the bishop, but loses material after Nxe7+.
5. **f7g6** (Pawn to g6): Kicks the knight, but White can play Nxe7+.

**Tactical considerations:**
- If 1... Qxg3, then 2. hxg3 Rxg8, and Black is threatening mate on g2. White cannot defend g2 easily.
- If 1... Qxg3, White cannot play fxg3 because the pawn is pinned by the bishop on f3.

**Calculation:**
1... Qxg3  
2. hxg3 Rxg8  
Now, Black is threatening mate on g2. White cannot defend g2 with a pawn, and the only way to stop mate is to play Nd2 or Bf4, but both are too slow.

**Conclusion:**
The move **Qxg3** is crushing, threatening mate and exploiting the pin on the f3 pawn.

My move is:
```
d6g3
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2krB1r1/ppp1bp2/5nN1/8/3Pp3/PPP1PbP1/7P/RNB3K1 b - - 0 20

**Material count:**
- Black: Rooks (c8, g8), Bishop (e7), Bishop (f3), Knight (f6), pawns (a7, b7, c7, e4, g7)
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (e8), Knight (g6), pawns (a3, b3, c3, d4, h2)

**White's threats:**
- White's bishop on e8 is attacking f7 and c6.
- White's knight on g6 is menacing, threatening to jump to e7 or f8.
- Black's king is on c8, relatively safe for now, but White has pressure.

**Black's threats:**
- Black's bishop on f3 is pinning the g2 pawn, but not much else.
- Black's knight on f6 is defending, but could become active.
- Black's bishop on e7 is defending, but could be repositioned.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8e8**: Exchange of rooks, but White's bishop on e8 is strong.
2. **d8e8**: Rook to e8, challenging the bishop.
3. **f6e8**: Knight captures bishop, but then White can play Nxe7+.
4. **f3h5**: Bishop to h5, attacking the knight, but not very effective.
5. **f7g6**: Pawn captures knight, but then White's bishop can recapture.
6. **e7f8**: Bishop to f8, defending the back rank.
7. **g8g7**: Rook to g7, defending the seventh rank.

**Critical lines:**

- If **d8e8** (Rook e8), White can play Nxe7+ and after Rxe7, Bxf7, and Black is in trouble.
- If **f6e8** (Knight takes bishop), White plays Nxe7+ and after Rxe7, Bxf7.
- If **e7f8** (Bishop f8), White can play Nxf8, Rxf8, and then d5, opening the center.
- If **g8g7** (Rook g7), White can play Nxe7+ and after Rxe7, Bxf7.

**Best defensive move:**

- **g8f8**: Rook to f8, defending the f7 pawn, and keeping the back rank protected. This also prepares to double rooks on the f-file if needed and keeps the king safe.

**Final move:**
```
g8f8
```

- White: King on g1, rook on a1, bishop on c1, knight on h8, bishop on e8, pawns on a3, b3, c3, d4, g3, h2.

**Material:**
- Black: Rook, 2 bishops, knight, 6 pawns.
- White: Rook, 2 bishops, knight, 6 pawns.

**Key features:**
- White's knight is on h8, which is awkwardly placed and not immediately threatening.
- Black's bishop on f3 is very strong, pinning the g2 pawn and controlling important diagonals.
- Black's king is relatively safe on c8.
- White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed due to the lack of pawn cover on the kingside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f8h8**: Rook to h8, attacking the knight. However, the knight is not going anywhere and is not a threat.
2. **f8g8**: Rook to g8, possibly preparing to double on the g-file or attack g3.
3. **f8e8**: Rook to e8, challenging the bishop on e8.
4. **d8e8**: Queen to e8, but there is no queen on the board.
5. **e7d6**: Bishop to d6, centralizing the bishop.
6. **f6g8**: Knight to g8, possibly to attack the knight on h8.
7. **f3g4**: Bishop to g4, attacking the rook on a1.
8. **f3g2**: Bishop to g2, attacking the h1 square.

**Critical tactical ideas:**
- The bishop on f3 is very strong, and the rook on f8 can swing to the g-file to attack the g3 pawn.
- The knight on h8 is trapped and not participating.
- White's king is vulnerable.

**Best move:**
- **f8g8**: This move threatens to double rooks on the g-file and attack the g3 pawn, which is pinned and cannot be defended by the king. This could lead to a decisive attack on the white king.

Let's check for any immediate tactics:
- If **f8g8**, White cannot defend g3 easily. If White tries to defend with Kf2, then Ng4+ is very strong.
- If White tries to play Bf7, then Rxg3+ is crushing.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8g8
```

2025-06-22 11:33:02,190 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.47s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- White: King on g1, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, Knight on h8, Bishop on f7, Pawns on a3, b3, c3, d4, g3, h2
- Black: King on c8, Rook on g8, Queen missing, Bishop on e7, Knight on f6, Bishop missing, Pawns on a7, b7, c7, e4, f3

**Material:**
- White: R, B, B, N, 6 pawns
- Black: R, B, N, 6 pawns

**Threats:**
- White's bishop on f7 is menacing, and the knight on h8 is awkward but could become active.
- Black's pawn on f3 is strong, but could be a target.
- Black's king is relatively safe for now, but White has pressure.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8h8**: Rook to h8, attacking the knight on h8.
2. **f6g4**: Knight to g4, attacking the bishop on f7 and threatening f2+ ideas.
3. **e7d6**: Bishop to d6, defending f4 and possibly preparing to support the f3 pawn.
4. **d8f8**: Queenless, so not possible.
5. **c8b8**: King sidestep, but not urgent.
6. **f3g2**: Pawn push, but not legal (no pawn on f3 can move to g2).
7. **f6g4**: Knight move, as above.

**Critical lines:**
- If **g8h8**, White must respond to the threat on the knight. If White plays Bxg8, then Rxg8, and Black has exchanged the awkward knight for a rook, which is favorable.
- If **f6g4**, White can play Be6+ and after Kd8, Bxg4, White wins a pawn and attacks the rook on g8.
- If **e7d6**, White can play Be6+ and after Kd8, Nf7+ forks king and rook.

**Calculation:**
- **g8h8**: If White plays Bxg8, Rxg8, White's knight is gone, and Black's rook is active. If White plays Ng6, then Rxh2, and Black is up material.
- **f6g4**: White plays Be6+, Kd8, Bxg4, and White picks up the pawn and attacks the rook.
- **e7d6**: White plays Be6+, Kd8, Nf7+ and White is winning.

**Conclusion:**
The move **g8h8** forces the exchange of White's knight for Black's rook, but the knight is trapped and not participating, so this is a favorable exchange for Black. Other moves lose material or allow White to gain the initiative.

**Final move:**
```
g8h8
```

2025-06-22 11:33:20,921 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.00s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Kf1):**
- Black to move.
- Material: Black is up a pawn, but White has a strong bishop pair and a dangerous passed d-pawn.
- Black's king is on h8, rook on d8, rook on h8, bishop on e7, knight on f6, bishop on f3, pawns on a7, b7, c7, e4.
- White's king on f1, rook on a1, knight on b1, bishop on f7, bishop on c1, pawns on a3, b3, c3, d4, g3, h2.

**Threats and considerations:**
- White's bishop on f7 is very strong, eyeing e8 and g8.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8, but White has no immediate checks.
- Black's bishop on f3 is powerful, controlling the long diagonal and eyeing g2.
- Black's knight on f6 is well placed, defending h7 and d5.
- Black's rook on d8 is on an open file, but not yet active.
- Black's rook on h8 is not active but could swing to the g-file or h-file.
- White's d-pawn is dangerous but currently blockaded.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d8g8**: Doubling rooks on the g-file, threatening g2.
2. **f3g4**: Bishop attacks the knight on b1, but not very effective.
3. **f6g4**: Knight attacks the bishop on f7, but White can recapture.
4. **e7f8**: Retreat bishop, but passive.
5. **d8f8**: Double up on the f-file, but White's bishop on f7 is strong.
6. **h8g8**: Bring rook to g-file, double pressure on g3.
7. **c8b8**: Move king to b8, but not relevant.
8. **c7c6**: Prepare to push c5, but not urgent.

**Key tactical ideas:**
- The bishop on f3 and rook on d8 can coordinate on the g-file.
- The move **d8g8** threatens to double rooks on the g-file and attack g2, which is only defended by the king.
- White's bishop on f7 is strong, but if Black can exchange it, Black will be much better.

**Calculation:**
- If 23...d8g8, White has to defend g2. If 24. Bxg8 Rxg8, Black has a powerful attack on g2.
- If White plays 24. Nd2, defending g2, Black can play ...Rf8, increasing pressure.
- If White plays 24. Bf4, Black can play ...Nh5, attacking f4 and g3.

**Conclusion:**
The move **d8g8** is the most active, threatening to double rooks on the g-file and attack g2. It also keeps the initiative and puts pressure on White.

My move:
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

FEN: 2k3rr/ppp1b3/5n2/3B4/3Pp3/PPP1PbP1/7P/RNB2K2 b - - 3 24

Black to move.

Material:
- Black: King c8, Rooks g8 h8, Bishop e7, Knight f6, Bishop f3, Pawns a7 b7 c7 e4
- White: King f1, Rook a1, Bishop d5, Bishop c1, Knight b1, Pawns a3 b3 c3 d4 g3 h2

Key points:
- White's king is relatively safe on f1, but Black's pieces are very active.
- Black's bishop on f3 is a monster, controlling key diagonals and threatening g2.
- White's bishop on d5 is centralized, but Black has more piece activity.
- Black's rooks are doubled on the g-file, eyeing the g2 pawn.
- White's knight and rook are undeveloped on the queenside.

Candidate moves:
1. ... Rxg3 (g8g3): Sacrificing the rook to open the g-file and expose White's king. After hxg3, Rh1+ is mate.
2. ... Nxd5 (f6d5): Captures the bishop, but White recaptures with the pawn, opening the e-file.
3. ... Rh1+ (h8h1): Immediate check, but White can block with Kf2 or Qg1.
4. ... Rxg2 (g8g2): Not possible, as g2 is not occupied by a White piece.

Let's check ...Rxg3:
- 1... Rxg3 2. hxg3 Rh1+ 3. Kf2 Ng4# (if White plays Ke1, then Rh1# is mate)
- 1... Rxg3 2. hxg3 Rh1+ 3. Kf2 Ng4# is mate.

This is a forced mate in two after ...Rxg3.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g8g3
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k4r/ppp1b3/5n2/3B4/3Pp3/PPP1Pbr1/3N3P/R1B2K2 b - - 1 25

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (h8), Bishop (e7), Knight (f6), Rook (g3), Bishop (f3), pawns (a7, b7, c7, e4)
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (d5, c1), Knight (d2), King (f1), pawns (a3, b3, c3, d4, e3, h2)

**King safety:**
- White's king is on f1, somewhat exposed with Black's rook on g3 and bishop on f3 eyeing the kingside.
- Black's king is on c8, relatively safe for now.

**Threats:**
- Black is threatening Rxh2, which would be mate if the bishop on f3 wasn't pinned by the bishop on d5.
- White's bishop on d5 is a key defender, pinning the bishop on f3 to the king.

**Candidate moves:**
- g3g1+ (Rook check): White can block with Ke2 or Nxf1.
- g3g2: Threatening mate on h2, but White can defend.
- f3g4: Bishop moves, but loses pressure.
- h8g8: Doubling rooks on the g-file.
- e7d6: Bishop moves, but doesn't seem to improve position.
- f6g8: Retreats the knight, not active.
- f3h5: Bishop attacks the knight, but not decisive.
- c7c6: Attacks the bishop, but White can retreat.

**Key tactical ideas:**
- If the bishop on d5 is removed, Rxh2# is mate.
- The bishop on f3 is pinned, so can't move.
- The rook on g3 is very active.

**Critical lines:**
- If h8g8 (doubling rooks), White has to be careful about threats on the g-file.
- If c7c6, White's bishop must move, but then Rxh2 is mate if the bishop leaves the diagonal.

**Calculation:**
1. c7c6 (attacks bishop)
   - If Bxc6, bxc6, White loses a bishop.
   - If Bc4, then Rxh2 threatens mate, but White can play Nxf3.
   - If Bxe4, Nxe4, White wins a pawn but loses the bishop pair.

2. h8g8 (doubling rooks)
   - White can play Nxf3, but then exf3, and the threat of Rxg1+ is strong.

3. g3g1+ (check)
   - White plays Ke2, but then Rxa1, White loses a rook.

**Best move:**
- c7c6 seems to force the bishop to move, and if it leaves the diagonal, Rxh2 is mate. If Bxc6, bxc6, White loses a bishop. If Bc4, Rxh2 is mate. If Bxe4, Nxe4, White loses the bishop pair.

**Final move:**
```
c7c6
```

2025-06-22 11:34:04,808 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.54s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black: King on c8, rook on h8, bishop on e7, knight on f6, rook on g3, bishop on g3, pawns on a7, b7, c6, e4.
- White: King on f1, rook on a1, bishop on d5, bishop on c1, knight on d2, pawns on a3, b3, c4, d4, e3, h2.

**Material:**
- Black has two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and 5 pawns.
- White has two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and 6 pawns.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- Black's rook on g3 and bishop on g3 are very aggressively placed, threatening White's kingside.
- White's king is on f1, somewhat exposed.
- White's bishop on d5 is strong, but Black's pieces are more active.

**Immediate Threats:**
- Black's rook on g3 is attacking g2 and could swing to g1 or g2 for mating threats.
- The bishop on g3 is controlling key diagonals.
- White's bishop on d5 is attacking e4, but e4 is defended.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Rg1+** (g3g1): Immediate check, forcing White's king to move or block.
2. **Bh3+** (f3h3): Threatening to invade on h2 or h1.
3. **Nxd5** (f6d5): Capturing the strong bishop, but after cxd5, White's center is strong.
4. **cxd5** (c6d5): Recapturing on d5, but bishop is not attacking anything critical.
5. **Rh3** (f3h3): Threatening mate on h1 if the g-pawn moves.

**Deep Calculation:**
- **Rg1+** (g3g1): If White plays Kxg1, then Bh3# is mate.
- If White blocks with Ke2, then Rg2+ is devastating.
- If White blocks with Nf3, then exf3 is crushing.

**Check for Tactics:**
- After Rg1+, White has to play either Ke2 or Nf3.
- If Ke2, then Rg2+ Kd1 Rg1+ Nf1 Rxf1# is mate.
- If Nf3, exf3 is winning.

**Conclusion:**
The move **Rg1+** is crushing and leads to a forced mate or decisive material gain.

2025-06-22 11:34:21,056 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.41s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k4r/pp2b3/2p2n2/3B4/2PPp3/PP2Pb2/3N3P/R1B3K1 b - - 0 27

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook (h8), Bishop (e7), Knight (f6), Bishop (f3), pawns (a7, b7, c6, e4, g2)
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (d5, c1), Knight (d2), pawns (a3, b3, c4, d4, h2), King (g1)

**King safety:**
- Black king (c8) is relatively safe.
- White king (g1) is exposed, especially with Black's bishop on f3 and pawn on g2.

**Threats:**
- Black is threatening ...Rxh2, which would be mate if the bishop on f3 is not blocked.
- White's bishop on d5 is strong, but Black's pieces are coordinated and White's king is in danger.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Rxh2 (immediate threat, but let's check if it's mate or if White can block)
2. ...Nxd5 (removes a strong bishop, but loses the g2 pawn and attack)
3. ...cxd5 (captures a bishop, but again, the attack is more important)
4. ...Rh3 (threatening mate on h1, but White can block with Nxf3)
5. ...Ng4 (threatening mate ideas, but White can defend)

**Calculation of ...Rxh2:**
- 1...Rxh2! If 2. Nxf3 exf3 and White cannot stop Rh1# (the bishop on f3 covers h1).
- If 2. Nxf3 exf3, White has no checks, and Rh1# is unstoppable.

**Check for defensive resources:**
- After ...Rxh2, White's only defense is Nxf3, but after exf3, White cannot prevent Rh1#.

**Conclusion:**
The move ...Rxh2 is a forced mate in a few moves. This is the best move.

2025-06-22 11:34:43,357 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.18s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Ra2):**

- Black's king is on c8.
- Black's bishop on e7, knight on f6, pawns on a7, b7, c6, e4, f3, g2.
- Black's rook on h2.
- White's king on g1.
- White's bishop on d5, knight on d2, rook on a2, pawns on a3, b3, c4, d4.

**Material:**
- Black: Rook, bishop, knight, 6 pawns.
- White: Rook, bishop, knight, 5 pawns.

**Tactical and Strategic Considerations:**
- Black's rook on h2 is very active, threatening along the 2nd rank.
- White's bishop on d5 is strong, controlling key diagonals.
- Black's pawn on f3 is advanced and supported by the bishop on e7.
- White's king is relatively safe for now, but Black's threats on the 2nd rank are dangerous.
- Black's f3 pawn is a major asset, threatening to promote or create mating nets.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **h2h1**: Rook to h1, threatening mate ideas (but White can defend with Nf1 or Nf3).
2. **h2g2**: Rook to g2, attacking the king and possibly threatening mate if the knight moves.
3. **f3g2**: Pawn captures on g2, threatening to promote, but White can recapture with the king.
4. **f3h5**: Bishop to h5, but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.
5. **e7d6**: Bishop to d6, defending f4 and supporting the pawn.
6. **f6g4**: Knight to g4, attacking the rook on e3 and threatening f2+.
7. **f3g4**: Bishop to g4, attacking the rook on e2.

**Critical Lines:**
- The f3 pawn is a huge asset. If Black can push g2, White will have to give up material.
- The rook on h2 is very active. Moving it to h1 or g2 could create mating threats.

**Calculation:**
- **h2g2**: If 1... Rh2-g2 2. Kf1 (forced, otherwise g2+) Ng4 3. Nxe4 (trying to eliminate the f3 pawn) dxe4 4. Bxe4, but then Black has lost the f3 pawn.
- **f3g2**: 1... f3xg2 2. Kxg2, and the rook loses its activity.
- **f3h5**: 1... Bh5, not threatening much.
- **f6g4**: 1... Nf6-g4, threatening Ne3+ and f2+.
- **h2h1**: 1... Rh2-h1+ 2. Kf2 (or Kf1) Ng4+ 3. Nxg4 Bxg4, but White is not mated.

**Best Move:**
- **h2g2** looks very strong, as it threatens Rg2+ and if the king moves, then Ng4 with threats of Ne3+ and f2+.

Let's check the line:
1... Rh2-g2
2. Kf1 (only move)
3. Ng4 (threatening Ne3+ and f2+)
If White tries Nxe4, then dxe4 and the f3 pawn is still alive.

Alternatively, after 1... Rg2, if White plays Kf1, then Ng4, and if Nxe4, then dxe4, and the threat of Ne3+ is looming.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h2g2
```

2025-06-22 11:34:53,494 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.16s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on c8, bishop on e7, knight on f6, bishop on f3, rook on g2, pawns on a7, b7, c6, e4, g3
- White: King on f1, bishop on d5 and c1, knight on d2, rook on a2, pawns on a3, b3, c4, d4

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is relatively safe on c8.
- White's king is exposed on f1.

**Threats:**
- Black's rook on g2 is very active, threatening along the second rank.
- Black's bishop on f3 and knight on f6 are both eyeing key squares near White's king.
- White's bishop on d5 is strong, but Black has a lot of pressure.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. ...Rg1+ (forces White's king to move, possibly to f2 or e2)
2. ...Ng4 (threatening mate on h2, but White can defend)
3. ...Be2+ (forcing White's king to move, but White can block with Kg1)
4. ...cxd5 (removes White's strong bishop, but gives up pressure)
5. ...Nxd5 (removes White's bishop, but loses a piece after cxd5)

**Tactical Considerations:**
- ...Rg1+ is very forcing. If 30.Kf2, then ...Ng4# is mate.
- If 30.Ke1, then ...Ng4 is very strong, threatening mate on e3 and h2.

Let's check ...Rg1+:
- 29...Rg1+ 30.Kf2 Ng4# (mate)
- 29...Rg1+ 30.Ke1 Ng4 31.Nxf3 exf3 32.Bxf3 Bh4+ and Black is winning.

Therefore, the move ...Rg1+ is crushing and leads to mate or decisive material gain.

My move:

2025-06-22 11:35:11,955 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.28s):
Let's analyze the position step by step:

**Material Count:**
- Black: King (c8), Bishop (e7), Knight (f6), Bishop (f3), pawns (a7, b7, c6, e4)
- White: King (g1), Bishop (d5, c1), Knight (d2), Rook (a2), pawns (a3, b3, c4, d4)

**Position:**
- Black is up a bishop for a pawn.
- White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed.
- Black's bishops and knight are active.
- White's rook is on a2, not very active.
- Black's bishop on f3 is very strong, eyeing the g2 square and controlling important diagonals.
- Black's knight on f6 is centralized and ready to jump.
- White's bishop on d5 is active, but Black can challenge it.
- White's knight on d2 is passive.

**Tactical Motifs:**
- Black threatens ...Rh1# if the g2 square is not covered, but currently, there is no rook on the h-file.
- The bishop on f3 is pinning the knight on d2 to the rook on a2.
- Black's e4 pawn is restricting White's knight and bishop.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. ...c6xd5: Captures the active bishop, but opens the c-file and gives White a passed pawn.
2. ...Nxd5: Not possible.
3. ...e3: Pushes the pawn, threatening ...e2 and opening lines.
4. ...Ng4: Attacks h2, but not immediately threatening.
5. ...Bd6: Defends e4, but passive.
6. ...c5: Supports d4, but not urgent.
7. ...Bh5: Not threatening.
8. ...Bxa3: Captures a pawn, but not urgent.

**Critical lines:**
- ...cxd5 is the most forcing, as it removes White's best piece and opens the c-file for Black's bishop and rook (if needed).
- After ...cxd5, if cxd5, then ...Nxd5 is possible, but the knight is already on f6.
- If ...cxd5, White might try c5, but then ...dxc5 and Black is still up material.

**Check for tactics:**
- Is there a mate threat? Not immediately.
- Is there a way to win more material? ...cxd5 removes White's best piece and keeps Black's advantage.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the bishop with ...cxd5, removing White's most active piece and maintaining a material advantage.

Final move:

2025-06-22 11:35:43,643 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.59s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), Bishop (e7), Knight (f6), Bishop (f3), Pawns (a7, b7, d5, e4, g2)
- White: King (g1), Bishop (b2), Knight (d2), Rook (a2), Pawns (a3, b3, c4, d4)

**Key factors:**
- Black is up material (two bishops and a knight for rook, bishop, and knight).
- Black's bishops and knight are active, especially the bishop on f3 and knight on f6.
- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1.
- Black has a passed pawn on e4 and a dangerous pawn on g2.
- White's rook on a2 is not very active.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's bishop on f3 is eyeing the d1-h5 diagonal.
- The pawn on g2 is one step from queening, but currently blocked by Black's own bishop.
- White has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Ng4: Threatens mate on h2 (if the bishop moves), but the bishop is currently blocking the pawn.
2. ...Bd6: Centralizes the bishop, but doesn't create immediate threats.
3. ...e3: Pushes the passed pawn, but White can block with Nxf3.
4. ...Nh5: Aiming for f4, but not immediately threatening.
5. ...b6: Solidifies the queenside.
6. ...dxc4: Captures a pawn, but opens the b2-g7 diagonal for White's bishop.

**Tactical ideas:**
- If the bishop on f3 moves, the pawn on g2 can advance.
- The knight can jump to g4 or h5 to threaten White's king.
- The bishop on e7 can move to d6 or c5 to increase pressure.

**Best move:**
After careful consideration, the move ...Ng4 stands out. It threatens to move the bishop and then push g2-g1=Q, and also eyes e3 and h2 squares. White has no immediate way to challenge this, and it increases pressure on White's king.

Therefore, the best move is:
```

2025-06-22 11:36:03,922 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.10s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on c8, pawns on a7, b7, d5, e4, bishop on e7, knight on g4, bishop on f3
- White: King on g1, knight on d2, rook on a2, pawns on a3, b3, c4, d4, bishop on c1

**Immediate threats and considerations:**
- Black is up a piece (two bishops and a knight vs bishop and knight).
- White's king is somewhat exposed, but Black's king is also not entirely safe.
- Black's minor pieces are very active, especially the bishop on f3 and knight on g4.
- White's knight on d2 is currently not threatening much.
- White's bishop on c1 is passive.
- White's rook on a2 is not active.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The bishop on f3 is eyeing the d1 square, but White's knight covers it.
- The knight on g4 is very active and can jump to e3 or h2.
- The bishop on e7 can move to h4, pinning the knight if the g-pawn moves, but that's not possible now.
- The pawn on e4 is strong, restricting White's knight and bishop.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g4e3**: Knight to e3, attacking the rook on a2 and threatening to fork the king and bishop if the king moves to f2.
2. **f3g2**: Bishop to g2, attacking the knight on d2 and threatening to invade on h3.
3. **d5c4**: Pawn takes c4, opening the b-file and possibly activating the bishop.
4. **e7g5**: Bishop to g5, attacking the knight on d2.
5. **e7h4**: Bishop to h4, but this doesn't seem to do much.

Let's look at **g4e3**:
- If 32...Ne3, White must respond to the threat on the rook. If 33.Nxf3, then exf3 and Black has a passed pawn and a strong bishop pair.
- If 33.Rb2, then Nf5, and Black's knight is still active.
- If 33.Nxf3, exf3, and Black's pawn on f3 is very strong, threatening Bg5 and possibly Bh4.

What about **f3g2**?
- 32...Bf3-g2 attacks the knight on d2. If 33.Nxf3, exf3 and again the pawn is strong.
- If 33.Rc2, then Ne3, attacking the rook and threatening f1.

**d5c4**:
- 32...dxc4 opens the b-file, but White can respond with Nxc4, activating the knight.

**e7g5**:
- 32...Be7-g5 attacks the knight, but White can play Nxf3, exf3, and then Bxg5.

**Best move:**
The move **g4e3** (Ne3) is the most forcing, attacking the rook and threatening to fork. If White captures the knight, Black gets a very strong passed pawn on f3, supported by the bishop.

Therefore, my move is:
```
g4e3
```

2025-06-22 11:36:30,967 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.42s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Analysis:**
- Black: King on c8, pawns on a7, b7, d5, e4, bishop on e7, knight on f3, bishop on f3.
- White: King on g1, knight on d2, bishop on b2, rook on a2, pawns on a3, b3, c4, d4.

**Material:**
- Black: 2 bishops, knight, 4 pawns.
- White: rook, bishop, knight, 4 pawns.

**Imbalances:**
- Black is up a minor piece for a rook (bishop+knight vs rook).
- Black's king is relatively safe, White's king is far from the action.
- Black's minor pieces are very active and centralized.
- White's rook is on a2, not very active.
- Black has a passed e4 pawn, and White's queenside pawns are blockaded.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **f3xd2**: Captures the knight, but after Rxd2, White's rook becomes active.
2. **e3xd2**: Also captures the knight, but White can recapture with the rook or bishop.
3. **d5xc4**: Captures a pawn, but opens the d-file for White's rook.
4. **e4e3**: Pushes the passed pawn, but White can block with Nf1.
5. **b7b6**: Solidifies the queenside, but not urgent.
6. **Bishop moves**: e.g., Be7-h4, Be7-g5, but not immediately threatening.

**Critical Tactics:**
- The knight on f3 is very strong, and White's king is cut off.
- If we play **Nxd2**, White must recapture, but then we can play **e3**, threatening e2 and e1=Q.
- If we play **e3**, White can play Nf1, blocking the pawn.

**Calculation:**
- **Nxd2 Rxd2 e3**: White must play Rd1 (to stop e2), then we can play e2, and after Re1, we can play Bh4, threatening mate on f2.
- **Nxd2 Bxd2 e3**: White's bishop is less active than the rook.

**Best Plan:**
- Take the knight with the bishop or knight, then push the e-pawn.

**Which capture is better?**
- **Nxd2**: After Rxd2, e3, White has Rd1, but then e2, Re1, Bh4, and White is in trouble.
- **Bxd2**: After Rxd2, e3, White has Rd1, but the same line.

But if we take with the knight, we keep the bishop pair.

**Let's check for tactics:**
- **Nxd2 Rxd2 e3 Rd1 e2 Re1 Bh4**: White has to play Rc1+ to check, but after Kd7, White is lost.

**Conclusion:**
- **Nxd2** is the best move, keeping the bishop pair and starting the e-pawn push.

My move:
```
f3d2
```
2025-06-22 11:36:30,967 - WARNING - Illegal move: f3d2 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one. Note that we have give you all legal moves.

Thank you for the correction. Let's re-examine the position and legal moves.

**Current FEN:**  
2k5/pp2b3/8/3p4/2PPp3/PP2nb2/RB1N4/6K1 b - - 1 33

**Black to move. Legal moves:**  
c8d8, c8b8, c8d7, c8c7, e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7h4, e7b4, e7a3, f3h5, f3g4, f3g2, f3e2, f3h1, f3d1, e3f5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1, d5c4, b7b6, a7a6, b7b5, a7a5

**Analysis:**

- Black has a powerful bishop pair and knight on f3, with a strong passed e4 pawn.
- White's knight on d2 is pinned to the king by the bishop on b2.
- White's rook on a2 is not active.
- Black's e3 bishop and f3 knight are very active.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The move e3f1 is a check, forcing White's king to h1, but then what?
- The move f3g2 is a check, forcing White's king to h1, but then White's knight is still pinned.
- The move e3g2 is a check, forcing White's king to h1, but then what?
- The move d5c4 wins a pawn, but White can recapture with bxc4.
- The move e3d1 is a check, but White can play Nf1.
- The move e3f5 attacks the rook on b2, but White can defend.

**Critical calculation:**
- Let's try e3f1+:
    - 1... e3f1+ 2. Kxf1 (forced) Nxd2+ 3. Ke2 Nxb3 and Black wins material.
    - But White's king is on g1, so 1... e3f1+ 2. Kxf1 Nxd2+ 3. Ke2 Nxb3 and Black is up a piece.

But in the current position, the king is on g1, so e3f1+ is not possible.

- Let's try f3g2+:
    - 1... f3g2+ 2. Kxg2 (forced) e3g4 (threatening mate on h3), but White can play Nf1, defending h3.

- Let's try e3g2+:
    - 1... e3g2+ 2. Kxg2 Nxd2 (winning the pinned knight), but White can play Bc3, defending.

- Let's try e3d1+:
    - 1... e3d1+ 2. Nf1 (forced) and the knight is no longer pinned.

- Let's try d5c4:
    - 1... d5c4 2. bxc4 and the pawn structure is opened.

- Let's try e3f5:
    - 1... e3f5 2. Nxf3 exf3 and Black has a passed pawn.

**Best move:**
- The move e3f5 attacks the rook and threatens to win material.
- The move f3g2+ is also interesting, but after Kxg2, Black loses the knight.

**Final calculation:**
- e3f5 attacks the rook, and if Nxf3, exf3, and the pawn is very strong.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e3f5
```

2025-06-22 11:37:05,849 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.60s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black: King on c8, bishop on e7, knight on f5, bishop on f3, pawns on a7, b7, d5, e4
- White: King on g1, knight on d2, rook on a2, bishop on a1, pawns on a3, b3, c4, d4

**Material:**
- Black: 2 bishops, knight, 4 pawns
- White: rook, knight, bishop, 4 pawns

**Key features:**
- Black is up a minor piece for a rook (material is roughly balanced, but Black's pieces are very active).
- White's king is far from the action and somewhat boxed in.
- Black's bishops and knight are centralized and active.
- White's rook is on a2, not very active.
- White's knight is on d2, not threatening anything immediate.
- White's bishop is on a1, currently blocked by its own pawns.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- Black's knight on f5 is well placed, attacking d4 and e3.
- Black's bishop on f3 is eyeing the knight on d2.
- Black's bishop on e7 is defending d6 and can swing to other diagonals.
- Black's pawn on e4 is advanced and restricts White's knight.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxd4** (f5d4): Captures a pawn, but is it safe? After Nxd4, White can play Bxd4, but then Bc5 pins the bishop to the king. However, White can play Nxf3 first, but then Black recaptures with Bxf6.
2. **Bg5** (e7g5): Threatens to exchange off White's only active minor piece, but doesn't seem to do much.
3. **Ne3** (f5e3): Attacks the rook on a2 and the bishop on a1. If White plays fxe3, then dxe3 and the bishop on a1 is trapped.
4. **Bh4** (f3h4): Attacks the knight on d2, but White can defend.
5. **dxc4** (d5c4): Opens the d-file, but may allow White's rook to become active.
6. **e3** (e4e3): Pushes the pawn, but White can play Nxf3.

**Deep calculation on Ne3 (f5e3):**
- f5e3 attacks the rook on a2 and the bishop on a1.
- If White plays fxe3, then dxe3 and the bishop on a1 is trapped.
- If White moves the rook, say Ra8+, Kd7, then White has no follow-up.
- If White plays Nxf3, then Bxf6, and Black is still up a piece.

**Let's check the safety of Ne3:**
- After Ne3, White cannot take on f3 because the bishop is defended.
- If White plays Nxf3, Bxf6, White has no immediate threats.
- If White plays fxe3, dxe3, the bishop on a1 is trapped and will be lost.

**Conclusion:**
- Ne3 is a powerful move, attacking two pieces and threatening to win material.

**Final move:**
```
f5e3
```

2025-06-22 11:37:31,149 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.44s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on c8, pawns on a7, b7, e4, bishop on e7, knight on f3
- White: King on g1, pawns on a3, b3, d4, d5, bishop on a1, knight on d2, rook on a2

**Positional factors:**
- Black is up a piece (bishop for a pawn).
- White's bishop is on a1, not very active.
- Black's knight on f3 is extremely powerful, attacking many squares and controlling key central and kingside squares.
- Black's bishop on e7 is well-placed, eyeing the long diagonal and supporting e4.
- White's king is relatively safe for now, but Black's pieces are poised for action.
- White's d5 pawn is advanced, but Black can blockade or attack it.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxd2** (f3d2): Captures the knight, but gives up the powerful knight for a less active one. Not ideal unless it wins material or leads to a clear win.
2. **Bf6** (e7f6): Improves the bishop, but doesn't threaten much immediately.
3. **Bh4** (e7h4): Attacks the rook on a2, but the rook can move.
4. **Nxd4** (f3d4): Not possible, as the knight is on f3.
5. **e3**: Not possible, as pawn is on e4.
6. **Nxd5** (not possible, as knight is on f3).
7. **Nf1** (f3h1): Forks the rook and bishop, but after Kf2, the knight is trapped.
8. **Nxd2** (f3d2): After Rxd2, Black can play e3, but White can respond with Rd3.
9. **Nf1** (f3h1): After Kf2, knight is trapped.

**Best move:**
- **Nxd2** (f3d2) is the most forcing, as it exchanges off White's knight and leaves Black with a material advantage and a strong bishop pair. After Rxd2, Black can play e3, threatening exd2 and pushing the e-pawn. White's pieces are awkward, and Black's bishop and pawns are strong.

**Double-checking tactics:**
- Is there a better move? Bh4 attacks the rook, but after Nf1, White can defend.
- e3 immediately is not possible, as pawn is on e4.
- No immediate checkmate threats for White.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f3d2
```
2025-06-22 11:37:31,149 - WARNING - Illegal move: f3d2 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one. Note that we have give you all legal moves.

2025-06-22 11:37:37,031 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.88s):
Thank you for your patience. Let's carefully reconsider the position and the legal moves.

**Legal moves:**
c8d8, c8b8, c8d7, c8c7, e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7h4, e7b4, e7a3, f3h5, f3g4, f3g2, f3e2, f3h1, f3d1, e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1, b7b6, a7a6, b7b5, a7a5

**Key points:**
- Black's knight on f3 is very strong.
- White's king is on g1, bishop on a1, rook on a2, knight on d2.
- Black's bishop on e7, pawns on a7, b7, e4.
- White's pawns on a3, b3, d4, d5.

**Candidate moves:**
- **f3d1**: Knight to d1, attacking the bishop on a1 and threatening to win the exchange after Rxd1.
- **e7h4**: Bishop to h4, attacking the rook on a2.
- **e3d5**: Knight to d5, attacking the bishop on a1 and threatening to fork.
- **e7a3**: Bishop to a3, attacking the rook on a2.
- **e7f6**: Bishop to f6, centralizing.
- **e7g5**: Bishop to g5, attacking the knight on d2.
- **e3f1**: Knight to f1, check, but White can play Kxf1.
- **b7b6**: Pawn move, but not urgent.
- **a7a5**: Pawn move, not urgent.

**Tactical checks:**
- **f3d1**: If Nxd1, Rxd1, Black wins the bishop for a knight, but White's rook is active.
- **e7h4**: If Ra4, bishop is safe, but not much gained.
- **e7a3**: If Rxa3, bishop is exchanged for rook and pawn, not ideal.
- **e3d5**: Not possible, as knight is on f3.

**Best move:**
- **f3d1** is strong, attacking the bishop and threatening to win material. If White plays Rxd1, Black can play Bxa3, winning the exchange.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f3d1
```

2025-06-22 11:38:13,862 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.28s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Ba1):**
- Black: King on c8, pawns on a7, b7, e4, d4; bishop on e7, bishop on d1; knight on e3
- White: King on h2, pawns on a3, b3, d5, d4; knight on d2; rook on a2; bishop on a1

**Material:**
- Black: 2 bishops, knight, 4 pawns
- White: rook, bishop, knight, 4 pawns

**Key features:**
- Black is up a minor piece for a rook (bishop pair + knight vs. rook + knight + bishop).
- Black's knight on e3 is very strong, attacking d1, f1, g2, c2, d5.
- Black's bishop on d1 is attacking b3 and covers key squares.
- White's king is far away on h2, potentially vulnerable to a mating net if Black can open lines.
- White's rook is on a2, not very active.
- Black's passed e4 pawn is supported and advanced.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e3g4** (N-g4+): Check, forcing White's king to move. After Kh3, Black can continue with Bd6, threatening mate on h2.
2. **e3f5** (N-f5): Attacks d4 and g3, but doesn't create immediate threats.
3. **e3d5** (N-d5): Attacks b4 and f4, but White can respond with Nxe4.
4. **d1h5** (B-h5): Threatens to invade on h4, but White can play Kg1.
5. **e7d6** (B-d6): Prepares to bring the bishop to f4 or g3, but not forcing.
6. **e3c2** (N-c2): Attacks rook and bishop, but White can play Rxc2.

**Most forcing move:** 
- **e3g4+** (N-g4+) is a check and forces White's king to move. After Kh3, Black can play Bd6, threatening mate on h2. If White plays Kg1, Black can continue with Bh4, threatening mate on f2.

**Let's check the line:**
1. ... Ng4+ 
   - If Kh3, Bd6 threatens mate on h2.
   - If Kg1, Bh4 threatens mate on f2.

**Is there any defense for White?**
- After Ng4+ Kh3, Bd6, White has no good way to stop Bh2# except sacrificing material.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
e3g4

2025-06-22 11:38:40,946 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.49s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), Bishop (e7), Knight (g4), Bishop (d1), Pawns (a7, b7, e4)
- White: King (g1), Knight (d2), Rook (a2), Bishop (a1), Pawns (a3, b3, d4, d5)

**Key factors:**
- Black is up a bishop for a pawn.
- White's king is far from the action and boxed in.
- Black's pieces are active, especially the knight on g4 and the bishop on d1.
- White's knight on d2 is passive, and the rook on a2 is not very active.
- Black's e4 pawn is advanced and can be pushed to e3, threatening to create a passed pawn and open lines.
- Black's bishop on d1 controls the a4-e8 diagonal and cuts off the white king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. e4e3: Pushes the pawn, threatening to advance further and possibly promote. Also threatens exd2 if the knight moves.
2. d1e2: Attacks the rook on a2, but the rook can move.
3. g4e3: Knight takes pawn, but then White can play d6, threatening to promote.
4. g4h6: Repositions the knight, but doesn't create immediate threats.
5. b7b6: Prepares to develop the bishop, but not urgent.
6. c8d8: King move, but not necessary now.

**Critical lines:**
- e4e3 is very strong. If White plays fxe3, then Nxe3 attacks the rook and threatens Nc2, forking king and rook. If White ignores, Black can play e2, threatening to promote.

**Check for tactics:**
- e4e3 is the most forcing move, creating a dangerous passed pawn and opening lines for Black's pieces.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the e-pawn, creating a dangerous threat and activating Black's pieces.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/pp2b3/8/3P4/P2P2n1/1P2p3/R2N4/B2b2K1 b - - 0 38

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), Bishop (e7), Knight (g4), Bishop (d1), pawns (a7, b7, e3)
- White: King (g1), Knight (d2), Rook (a2), Bishop (a1), pawns (a4, b3, d5, d4)

**Key features:**
- Black is up a piece (two bishops and a knight vs rook, bishop, and knight).
- White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed.
- Black's e3 pawn is advanced and dangerous.
- Black's knight on g4 is aggressive, eyeing f2 and h2.
- White's rook is on a2, not very active.
- Black's bishop on d1 is pinning the knight on d2 to the rook on a2.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e3e2**: Advance the pawn, threatening e1=Q. White's knight can't capture due to the pin.
2. **d1e2**: Capture the pinned knight, winning material.
3. **g4e3**: Capture the knight with the knight, but this loses the pin and is not as strong.
4. **g4h2**: Check, but White just moves the king to h1.
5. **d1c2**: Attack the rook, but White can move it.
6. **b7b6**: Not urgent, pawn moves are slow.

**Deep calculation:**

- **e3e2**: If White plays Nf1, then e1=Q, and after Rxe2, Bxe2, Black is up a piece and wins easily. If White tries to block with Ra1, then e1=Q+, Nf1, Qxf1#, that's mate.
- **d1e2**: Wins a piece immediately, but after Nf1, the e3 pawn is still strong, but White can try to defend.
- **g4h2+**: Kg2, and nothing is achieved.

**Best move:**
- **e3e2** is the most forcing. It threatens e1=Q, and White can't stop it without losing massive material or getting mated.

**Final move:**
```
e3e2

- Black has a pawn on e2, one step from promotion.
- Black's minor pieces are active.
- White's king is on g1, not very active.
- White's rook is on a2, bishop on a1, knight on d2.
- Black can promote the e2 pawn immediately.

**Critical analysis:**
- Promoting the pawn to a queen (e2e1q) seems very strong, but let's check for any tactical shots for White after that.
- After e2e1q, White can play Nf1 (attacking the queen and covering h2), but Black's queen is safe.
- White's pieces are not coordinated for any immediate threats.
- Black's bishop on d1 covers a4 and b3, so White's rook cannot invade.
- Black's knight on g4 is very active, and White's king is exposed.

**Alternative moves:**
- e2e1r, e2e1b, e2e1n: Underpromotions are not necessary here, as the queen is the most powerful.
- Other moves (bishop or knight moves) do not pose an immediate threat or win.

**Conclusion:**
- Promoting the pawn to a queen is the best move, as it gives Black a decisive material advantage and White has no compensation.

My move:
```
e2e1q
```

2025-06-22 11:39:34,352 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 10.48s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/pp2b3/8/3P4/PP1P2n1/8/R7/B2bqNK1 b - - 1 40

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen (e1), Bishop (d7), Bishop (e7), Knight (g4), pawns a7, b7
- White: Rook (a2), Bishop (a1), King (g1), pawns a4, b4, d5, d4

**King safety:**
- White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed but not immediately in danger.
- Black's king is on c8, relatively safe.

**Threats:**
- Black has a powerful queen on e1, and a knight on g4 attacking f2 and h2.
- White's pieces are awkwardly placed, with the rook on a2 and bishop on a1 not participating in the defense.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe1xf1+**: Immediate check, but White can block with the bishop or move the king.
2. **Qe1e3+**: Check, but White can block with Rf2 or move the king.
3. **Qe1e4**: Centralizes the queen, but not a check.
4. **Ng4e3**: Attacks the queen, but not a check.
5. **Qe1e2**: Attacks the bishop, but not a check.
6. **Qe1h4**: Threatens mate on h2, but White can defend with f3.

But let's look for forced lines:

**1. Qe1xf1+**
- If Kxf1, then Ne3+ forks king and rook, but White can play Kg1.
- If Bxf1, then Ne3+ forks king and rook, but White can play Kg1.
- If Kh2, then Qh4# is mate.

But after Qxf1+, White must respond:
- Kxf1: Ne3+ (forks king and rook), Kg1, Nxc2, White's rook is lost.

**Is there a mate?**
- Qxf1+ Kxf1 Ne3+ Kg1 Nxc2, Black wins the rook and is up a queen for a rook and bishop.

Alternatively, **Qe1e3+**:
- Kg2: Qe4+ (drives king to h3), but White can block with Rg2.

**Qe1h4**:
- Threatens mate on h2, but White can defend with f3.

**Qe1f2+**:
- Kh1: Qh2# is mate.

So, **Qe1f2+** is a forced mate if White plays Kh1.

Let's check:
- Qe1f2+ Kh1 Qh2# (mate)
- Qe1f2+ Kh2: Qh4# (mate)
- Qe1f2+ Kh3: Qh4# (mate)

But White's only legal moves after Qe1f2+ are Kh1, Kh2, Kh3. All lead to mate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e1f2
```

2025-06-22 11:39:48,805 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.91s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black: King on c8, bishop on e7, knight on g4, bishop on d1, pawns on a7, b7.
- White: King on f1, rook on f2, bishop on a1, pawns on d5, d4, b4, a4.

**Material:**
- Black: 2 bishops, knight, 2 pawns
- White: rook, bishop, 4 pawns

**Threats and considerations:**
- White's rook on f2 is active, but Black's minor pieces are coordinated.
- Black's bishop on d1 is attacking a4 and f3 squares.
- White's king is exposed.
- Black's knight on g4 is aggressive, eyeing e3, f2, h2, and h6.
- Black's bishop on e7 is well-placed, controlling key diagonals.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g4e3+** (Nxe3+): Forks king and rook, but White can play Ke1, and after Nxc2+, Rxc2, Black wins the exchange, but White's pawns are dangerous.
2. **g4f2** (Nxf2): Captures the rook, but after Kxf2, Black's knight is gone, and White's king is centralized.
3. **d1a4** (Ba4): Attacks the b-pawn, but not urgent.
4. **e7h4** (Be7-h4): Threatens mate on f2, but White can defend.
5. **g4e5** (Ng5-e5): Centralizes the knight, but not forcing.
6. **g4h2** (Ng4-h2): Threatens Nf3+, but White can play Kg2.

**Critical calculation:**
- **g4e3+** (Nxe3+): If White plays Ke1, then Nc2+ forks king and rook, but after Rxc2, Black is up a piece for a pawn.
- **g4f2** (Nxf2): If Kxf2, Black can play Bh4+ and win the bishop on a1.

Let's calculate **g4f2**:
1. ... Nxf2
2. Kxf2 Bh4+ (check)
3. Ke2 Bxf2 (winning another pawn and threatening d4)

Alternatively, after **g4e3+**:
1. ... Nxe3+
2. Ke1 (if Kg1, then Nxc2, forking king and rook)
3. ... Nc2+ (fork)
4. Rxc2 Bxc2

Black is up a piece, and White's pawns are not dangerous.

**Best move:**
- **g4e3+** is the most forcing, wins material, and keeps the initiative.

Final move:
```
g4e3

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/pp2b3/8/3P4/PP1P4/4n3/5R2/B2b1N1K b - - 2 42

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), pawns (a7, b7), bishop (e7), knight (e3), bishop (d1)
- White: King (h1), pawns (a4, b4, d5, d4), rook (f2), knight (f1), bishop (a1)

**Key features:**
- Black is up a piece (2 bishops + knight vs rook + knight + bishop).
- White's king is on h1, boxed in, and Black's pieces are very active.
- Black's bishop on d1 is cutting off the h5-e2 diagonal, and the knight on e3 is extremely powerful.
- White's rook is on f2, knight on f1, bishop on a1.
- Black's e3 knight attacks f1, g2, d1 bishop attacks a4, and e7 bishop is flexible.

**Immediate threats:**
- ...Bf3+ is a huge threat, as the king is stuck on h1 and the knight on f1 is pinned.
- ...Nxf1 is possible, but after Rxf1, White is still under pressure.
- ...Bf3+ forces Rxf3 (otherwise mate), then ...Nxf1, and Black is up a full piece and White's king remains exposed.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7f6** (Bf6): Prepares Bf3+ and keeps pressure.
2. **e7f3** (Bf3+): Immediate check, forces Rxf3, then Nxf1.
3. **e3f1** (Nxf1): Immediate capture, but after Rxf1, White's rook is more active.
4. **d1f3** (Bf3+): Same as e7f3, but from a different bishop.

But let's check the forced line:

1. ...Bf3+ (e7f3)
   - If Rxf3, then Nxf1, and Black is up a piece, and White's king is still stuck.
   - If Kg1, then Nxf1, and again, Black is up a piece.

Is there any mate? Let's check:

- ...Bf3+ Rxf3 Nxf1
- White has no checks, and Black is up a piece.

Alternatively, is there a forced mate?
- ...Bf3+ Kg1 Nxf1 (threatening Ng3#)
- White has no way to stop Ng3# except Rxf3, but then Nxf3#

So, let's check this line:

1. ...Bf3+ (e7f3)
   - If Kg1, then Nxf1, threatening Ng3# (mate, as the king is boxed in).
   - If Rxf3, then Nxf1, and again, Ng3# is unstoppable.

Therefore, the move ...Bf3+ is crushing and leads to mate.

**Final move:**
```
e7f3
```

Thank you for your patience. Let's re-examine the position and the legal moves.

**Legal moves:**
c8d8, c8b8, c8d7, c8c7, e7f8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6, e7g5, e7c5, e7h4, e7b4, e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, d1h5, d1g4, d1a4, d1f3, d1b3, d1e2, d1c2, b7b6, a7a6, b7b5, a7a5

Let's analyze the position:

- Black's knight on e3 is extremely powerful, and the bishop on d1 is pinning the f1 knight.
- White's king is stuck on h1, and the rook on f2 is the only defender.
- The move ...Nxf1 (e3f1) is possible, capturing the pinned knight and threatening mate ideas.

Let's check ...Nxf1:

1. ...Nxf1
   - If Rxf1, then Black can play Bxa4, winning a pawn and keeping the initiative.
   - If Kg1, then the rook is still pinned, and Black can continue with Bxa4 or other improving moves.

Is there a forced mate? Not immediately, but ...Nxf1 wins material and keeps the attack.

**Other candidate moves:**
- ...Bd1f3 (d1f3) is legal and gives check, but the rook can take on f3.
- ...Bd1g4 (d1g4) attacks the rook, but the rook can move.
- ...Bd1a4 (d1a4) wins a pawn, but less forcing.

**Conclusion:** The move ...Nxf1 (e3f1) is the most forcing, winning material and keeping the attack.

**Final move:**
```
e3f1
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black: King on c8, Bishop on e7, Bishop on d1, Knight on f1, pawns on a7, b7
- White: King on h1, Rook on f6, pawns on d5, d4, b4, a4, Bishop on a1

**Material:**
- Black: 2 bishops, knight, 2 pawns, king
- White: rook, bishop, 4 pawns, king

**Threats:**
- White's rook on f6 is very active, but White's king is stuck on h1 and is vulnerable to back-rank threats.
- Black's minor pieces are very active and coordinate well, especially with the knight on f1 and bishop on d1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop e7xf6**: Captures the rook, but let's check if it's safe.
   - After Bxf6, White has no immediate check or threat. White's bishop is on a1 and can't participate.
   - White's pawns are far from queening, and Black's pieces dominate the board.
   - This wins the exchange and leaves Black with a decisive material advantage.

2. **Other moves**: None of the other moves (bishop or knight moves, king moves, pawn moves) are as strong as simply capturing the rook.

**Tactics:**
- After Bxf6, White has no checks, and Black's pieces dominate the board.
- White's king is still trapped on h1, and Black can continue to press for mate or further material gain.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the rook with the bishop.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/pp6/5b2/3P4/PP1P4/8/6K1/B2b1n2 b - - 1 44

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), Bishop (f6), Bishop (d1), Knight (f1), Pawns (a7, b7)
- White: King (g2), Bishop (a1), Pawns (d5, d4, b4, a4)

**Position:**
- Black is up a piece (2 bishops and a knight vs 1 bishop).
- White has advanced pawns, but Black's minor pieces are active.
- Black's king is safe.
- White's king is on g2, somewhat exposed.
- Black's knight on f1 is very strong, controlling key squares.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Nd2** (f1d2): Attacks the bishop on a1 and the pawn on b4. If the bishop moves, Black can take b4.
2. **Ne3+** (f1e3): Check, but White can block with Kf2 or Kg1.
3. **Bxd4** (d1d4): Captures a pawn, but White can recapture with the c-pawn.
4. **Bxd4** (f6d4): Also captures a pawn, but White can recapture.
5. **b6** (b7b6): Prepares to activate the queenside pawns.
6. **a5** (a7a5): Similar idea, but less urgent.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- The knight on f1 is attacking the bishop on a1 and the pawn on h2 (but h2 is not present).
- The bishop on d1 is attacking a4 and b3 squares.
- White's bishop on a1 is not very active.

**Best Plan:**
- Black should press the material advantage and try to win more pawns or force a trade of pieces.
- The move **Nd2** (f1d2) attacks the bishop and threatens to win the b4 pawn. If the bishop moves, Black can take b4, further reducing White's counterplay.

**Calculation:**
- 1...Nd2 2. Bc3 (only move to save the bishop) Nb3 (attacking the bishop again and threatening to win the a4 pawn).
- If 2. Bc3 Nb3 3. Kf2 Nxa1, Black wins the bishop.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
f1d2

2025-06-22 11:41:04,771 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.20s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/pp6/5b2/3P4/PP1P4/8/3n3K/B2b4 b - - 3 45

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), Bishop (f6), Bishop (d1), Knight (d2), pawns (a7, b7)
- White: King (h2), Bishop (a1), pawns (d5, d4, a4, b4)

**Position:**
- White's king is on h2, far from the action.
- Black's pieces are centralized and active.
- White's bishop is stuck on a1, blocked by its own pawns.
- Black's knight on d2 controls key squares and blocks the d-pawn.
- Black's bishops are active and can coordinate for threats.
- Black is up a piece (White has only one bishop for Black's two bishops and a knight).

**Immediate threats and tactics:**
- Black can consider pushing the queenside pawns, but White's pawns are also advanced.
- Black's bishop on f6 can attack the a1 bishop or support other threats.
- The knight on d2 is very powerful, controlling many squares and restricting White's king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d2f3+** (Check): King must move to h1, then what? Not much follow-up, but it keeps White's king stuck.
2. **f6d4**: Attack the b4 pawn, but White can defend with bishop or push.
3. **d1a4**: Attack the b4 pawn, but not decisive.
4. **f6g5**: Threaten to invade on e3 or f4, but not immediate.
5. **d2b3**: Attack the a1 bishop, but White can defend.
6. **d2e4**: Centralize the knight, but not a direct threat.

**Best plan:**
- Black should try to activate the pieces, threaten White's pawns, and keep White's king cut off.
- The move **d2f3+** forces White's king to h1, after which Black can try to invade with the bishops or knight, or push the queenside pawns.

Let's check the consequences of **d2f3+**:
- 45...Nd2-f3+ 46.Kh1 (forced)
- Now, Black can play ...Bxd4, ...Bxd4, or ...Bxd4, but White's king is stuck on h1, and Black can slowly improve.

Alternatively, **d1a4** attacks the b4 pawn, but White can defend with Bc3.

**Another idea:** **f6d4** attacks the b4 pawn and threatens to win material.

But the most forcing move is **d2f3+**, which restricts White's king and keeps the initiative.

**Final move:**
```
d2f3
```

2025-06-22 11:41:20,504 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.62s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black king on c8
- Black pawns: a7, b7
- Black bishop on d1
- Black knight on f3
- Black bishop on f6

- White king on h3
- White pawns: d5, d4, a4, b4
- White bishop on a1

**Material:**
- Black: 2 bishops, knight, 2 pawns
- White: bishop, 4 pawns

**Threats & Evaluation:**
- Black is up a piece for two pawns.
- White's king is cut off on the kingside, and Black's pieces are active.
- Black's knight on f3 is a monster, controlling many squares around the White king.
- White's bishop on a1 is out of play.
- Black's bishop on d1 is eyeing a4 and b3 squares.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate or a way to win more material?
- The White king is on h3, and the knight on f3 can jump to g5, h4, or e5.
- Bishop on f6 can go to h4, g5, e5, d4.
- Bishop on d1 can attack a4, b3, e2, c2.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f3g5+**: Knight check. If White plays Kh4, then ...Nf3+ again, repeating. If Kg3, then ...Ne4+ is possible.
2. **f3h4+**: Knight check. If K moves to g3, then ...Nf5+ is possible.
3. **f6h4**: Bishop to h4, threatening mate on g3.
4. **d1a4**: Bishop takes pawn, threatening to invade.
5. **d1b3**: Bishop takes pawn, threatening to invade.

Let’s calculate **f3g5+**:
- 1...Nf3-g5+ 2.Kh4 (only move)
- 2...Nf3 (repeat)
So, that's a repetition.

What about **f6h4**:
- 1...Bf6-h4
- Threatening mate on g3.
- White can play Kg2, but then ...Ne1+ wins the bishop on a1.
- If Kg4, then ...f5+ is not possible, but ...h5+ is not possible either.

What about **d1a4**:
- 1...Bd1xa4
- Now threatening to invade on b3 or c2.
- White still can't activate the bishop.

What about **f3h4+**:
- 1...Nf3-h4+ 2.Kg4 (only move)
- 2...Nf5 (forking king and bishop, but bishop is on a1, so not effective)

What about **f3e5**:
- 1...Nf3-e5
- Threatening to go to f3 again, but not much.

What about **f6d4**:
- 1...Bf6-d4
- Attacking a1, but not a big threat.

What about **f6g5**:
- 1...Bf6-g5
- Threatening mate on g2, but White can play Kg4.

**Best move:**
**Bf6-h4** is very strong, threatening mate on g3, and if White tries to escape, Black can win the bishop on a1 or continue the attack.

Let's check for any tactics for White after ...Bf6-h4:
- 1...Bf6-h4
- If Kg2, then ...Ne1+ wins the bishop.
- If Kg4, then ...h5+ is not possible, but ...f5+ is not possible either.
- If d6, then ...Ng5# is mate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f6h4
```

2025-06-22 11:41:34,558 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.65s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), pawns (a7, b7), bishop (d1), bishop (h4), knight (f3)
- White: King (h3), pawns (a4, b4, d5, d4), bishop (b2)

**Position:**
- Black is up a piece (bishop and knight vs bishop).
- White's king is exposed on h3, and Black's minor pieces are very active.
- Black's bishop on h4 is cutting off the White king's escape squares.
- Black's knight on f3 is very powerful, controlling key squares around the White king.
- Black's bishop on d1 is also well-placed, potentially threatening to invade.

**Threats:**
- Black can consider moves like ...Ng5+ or ...Bf2, increasing pressure on the White king.
- White's only bishop is on b2, far from the action.
- White's pawns are advanced but not immediately threatening.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **...Ng5+** (f3g5): This checks the White king. If Kh2, then Nf3+ is mate.
2. **...Bf2** (d1e2): Threatens mate on g3.
3. **...Bf2** (d1b3): Attacks the b4 pawn, but less forcing.
4. **...Nd2** (f3d2): Attacks the bishop, but less forcing.

Let's check the forcing line with ...Ng5+:

- 1...Ng5+ 2.Kh2 (only move)
- 2...Nf3# is mate.

So ...Ng5+ is a forced mate in two.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f3g5
```

2025-06-22 11:41:46,538 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.82s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on c8, pawns on a7, b7, bishop on d1, knight on g5, bishop on h4
- White: King on g2, pawns on d5, d4, a4, b4, bishop on b2

**Material:**
- Black: 2 bishops, knight, 2 pawns
- White: bishop, 4 pawns

**Threats and Tactics:**
- Black's minor pieces are very active and White's king is exposed.
- Black's bishop on d1 and knight on g5 coordinate well.
- The bishop on h4 eyes the g3 square, which could be a mating net if the king is forced to h3.
- White's bishop on b2 is not currently threatening anything immediate.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **g5h3+**: Knight check. If White plays Kxh3, then Bf6 is mate. If Kf1, then Bf3 is mate.
2. **d1g4**: Threatens to attack the g3 square, but not as forcing as a check.
3. **d1e2**: Attacks the bishop, but White can defend.
4. **h4g3**: Captures a pawn, but not as forcing as a check.

**Calculation:**
- **g5h3+**: 
    - If Kxh3, then Bf6# (mate).
    - If Kf1, then Bf3 is mate.
    - If Kf1, then Bf3# (mate).
    - If Kh2, then Bf3 is mate.

This is a forced mate in one after the check.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is the knight check, which leads to immediate mate.

2025-06-22 11:41:59,861 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.67s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/pp6/8/3P4/PP1P3b/7n/6K1/2Bb4 b - - 11 49

- Black: King on c8, pawns on a7, b7, bishop on h4, knight on h3
- White: King on g2, pawns on d5, d4, b4, a4, bishop on c1

**Material:**
- Black: Bishop, knight, 2 pawns
- White: Bishop, 4 pawns

**Positional factors:**
- Black's bishop on h4 is active, eyeing the g3 square.
- Black's knight on h3 is close to the White king.
- White's king is exposed on g2.
- White's pawns are advanced but not immediately threatening.
- Black's king is relatively safe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h4g3**: Bishop to g3, threatening mate on f2.
2. **h3g5**: Knight to g5, attacking the bishop and covering f3.
3. **d1h5**: Bishop to h5, but not threatening much.
4. **h4e1**: Bishop to e1, attacking the bishop.
5. **h4f2**: Bishop to f2, check, but White can block with king or bishop.

**Tactical ideas:**
- **h4g3** threatens mate on f2, but White can play Bf4, defending f2.
- **h3g5** attacks the bishop on c1, but White can defend.
- **h4f2+** forces White's king to move, but after Kf1, no immediate follow-up.

Let’s check **h4g3**:
1. ... Bg3
   - If Kxh3, Nf4# (mate)
   - If Bf4, Bxf4, Kxh3, Nf4# (mate)
   - If d6, Bxd6, White has no defense to Nf4#.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- After Bg3, White is in zugzwang. If White plays any pawn move, Nf4# is coming.
- If White plays Bf4, Bxf4, Kxh3, Nf4#.

**Conclusion:** The move **h4g3** is a direct threat, and White cannot prevent mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h4g3
```

2025-06-22 11:42:10,542 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.81s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/pp6/8/1P1P4/P2P4/6bn/6K1/2Bb4 b - - 0 50

**Material count:**
- Black: King (c8), pawns (a7, b7), bishop (h3), bishop (d1), knight (none)
- White: King (g2), pawns (a4, b5, d4, d5), bishop (c1)

**Positional factors:**
- Black is up a bishop and has two connected passed pawns on the queenside.
- White has four pawns, but they are blockaded and not immediately threatening.
- Black's bishop on h3 is very powerful, controlling key squares and threatening to invade.
- White's king is far from the queenside and can't help stop the pawns.
- Black's king is safe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b7b6**: Start pushing the queenside pawns. White can't stop both.
2. **a7a6**: Same idea, but b6 is more direct.
3. **d1g4**: Attack the bishop on c1, but White can defend.
4. **h3g5**: Move the bishop to a more active square, but not necessary.
5. **d1f3**: Threaten to invade on e4 or g4.
6. **g3d6**: Centralize the bishop.

**Critical analysis:**
- The most direct plan is to push the b-pawn. White cannot stop both the a- and b-pawns, and Black's bishops control the promotion squares.
- White's king is too far to help.
- There are no immediate tactics for White.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to start pushing the b-pawn.

2025-06-22 11:42:23,797 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.89s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/p7/1p6/1P1P4/P2P4/4B1bn/6K1/3b4 b - - 1 51

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), Bishop (d1), Bishop (h3), Knight (g3), Pawn (a7, b6)
- White: King (g2), Bishop (e3), Pawns (a4, b5, d4, d5)

**Position:**
- Black is up a minor piece (2 bishops + knight vs 1 bishop).
- White has advanced pawns, but Black's pieces are very active.
- White's king is on g2, somewhat exposed.
- Black's knight on g3 is menacing, threatening forks and attacks.
- Black's bishop on d1 is controlling the long diagonal.
- White's bishop on e3 is defending, but not very active.

**Immediate threats and candidate moves:**
- The knight on g3 is attacking h1 and e2 squares.
- The bishop on d1 is attacking a4 and e2.
- The bishop on h3 is attacking g4 and f1.
- White's king is somewhat boxed in.

**Legal moves:**
- King moves: c8d8, c8b8, c8d7, c8c7, c8b7
- Knight moves: h3g5, h3f4, h3f2, h3g1
- Bishop moves: g3b8, g3c7, g3d6, g3e5, g3h4, g3f4, g3h2, g3f2, g3e1, d1h5, d1g4, d1a4, d1f3, d1b3, d1e2, d1c2
- Pawn moves: a7a6, a7a5

**Tactical ideas:**
- The bishop on d1 can attack e2, which could be a fork if the king moves.
- The knight on g3 can jump to f1 or h1, but those are not legal.
- The bishop on h3 can move to g4, pinning the bishop on e3 if the king moves.
- The bishop on d1 can go to e2, attacking the bishop on e3.

**Critical lines:**
- If ...Bg4, White can play Bf2, but then Nf5+ is possible.
- If ...Ne2, White can play Kf3, but then Nxd4+.
- If ...Bf3+, White must move the king, then Nf5+ or Ne2+.
- If ...Bxa4, White can push d6, but Black is still up material.

**Best move candidate:**
- ...Bf3+ looks strong, forcing the king to move, then Nf5+ or Ne2+ can follow, picking up more pawns or attacking the bishop.
- ...Bxa4 wins a pawn, but is less forcing.
- ...Bg4 attacks the bishop, but White can defend.

**Calculation:**
1. ...Bf3+ 
   - If Kxf3, then Nf5+ forks king and bishop.
   - If Kg1, then Ne2+ forks king and bishop.
   - If Kh2, then Nf1+ wins the bishop.

Let's check:
1. ...Bf3+ 
   - Kxf3 Nf5 (forks king and bishop, wins bishop)
   - Kg1 Ne2+ (forks king and bishop, wins bishop)
   - Kh2 Nf1+ (king must move, then Nxe3)

So, ...Bf3+ wins the bishop on e3 by force.

**Conclusion:** The best move is:
```
g3f1
```
But let's double-check: Is Bf3+ legal? The bishop is on h3, so h3f3 is legal.

So the correct move is:
```
h3f3
```
2025-06-22 11:42:23,797 - WARNING - Illegal move: g3f1 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one. Note that we have give you all legal moves.

2025-06-22 11:42:28,870 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.07s):
Thank you for your patience. Let's re-examine the position and the legal moves.

**FEN:** 2k5/p7/1p6/1P1P4/P2P4/4B1bn/6K1/3b4 b - - 1 51

**Black to move.**

**Legal moves:**
c8d8, c8b8, c8d7, c8c7, c8b7, h3g5, h3f4, h3f2, h3g1, g3b8, g3c7, g3d6, g3e5, g3h4, g3f4, g3h2, g3f2, g3e1, d1h5, d1g4, d1a4, d1f3, d1b3, d1e2, d1c2, a7a6, a7a5

**Analysis:**

- Black is up a piece and has a dominating position.
- White's king is on g2, bishop on e3, pawns on a4, b5, d4, d5.
- Black's knight on g3, bishops on d1 and h3, pawns on a7, b6.

**Key tactical ideas:**
- The bishop on d1 can attack a4 or e2.
- The knight on g3 can jump to several squares, but none seem to give an immediate fork.
- The bishop on h3 can move to f4, f2, g5, or g1.

**Candidate moves:**
- d1a4: wins a pawn, threatens to take more pawns.
- d1e2: attacks the bishop on e3.
- h3f4: attacks the bishop on e3.
- h3f2: attacks the king and bishop.
- g3e1: attacks the bishop on e3.
- a7a5: supports the b5 pawn push.

**Let's look at d1a4:**
- d1a4, White cannot defend the b5 pawn, and Black will start picking up pawns.

**Let's look at d1e2:**
- d1e2, threatens the bishop on e3, but White can defend with Bf2.

**Let's look at h3f2:**
- h3f2, attacks the king, but the king can move to f1 or h2.

**Let's look at g3e1:**
- g3e1, attacks the bishop, but White can play Kf2.

**Best move:**
Taking the pawn with d1a4 seems the most straightforward, as it wins material and keeps up the pressure.

**Final move:**
```
d1a4
```

2025-06-22 11:42:40,380 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.49s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/p7/1p6/1P1P4/b2P4/4B1Kn/8/8 b - - 0 52

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on c8, pawn on a7 and b6, bishop on a4, knight on h3
- White: King on h3, bishop on e3, pawns on b5, d5, d4

**Position:**
- White's king is on h3, far from the action.
- Black's bishop on a4 is well placed, controlling the d1–h5 diagonal.
- Black's knight on h3 is not attacked, but not very active.
- Black's king is on c8, relatively safe.
- White's bishop on e3 is active, controlling important squares.
- White's pawns are advanced, but not immediately threatening.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c8d8 (King move, but doesn't change much)
2. c8b8 (King move, stays safe)
3. c8d7 (King move, centralizes a bit)
4. c8c7 (King move, closer to the queenside pawns)
5. c8b7 (King move, supports b6 pawn)
6. a4b5 (Bishop captures pawn, but b5 is protected by the b6 pawn)
7. a4b3 (Bishop move, attacks d5 pawn)
8. a4c2 (Bishop move, attacks e3 bishop)
9. a4d1 (Bishop move, attacks d4 pawn)
10. h3g5 (Knight move, attacks e6 and f7 squares, but not very useful)
11. h3f4 (Knight move, attacks e2 and d3, but not much impact)
12. h3f2 (Knight move, attacks d1 and e4, but not much impact)
13. h3g1 (Knight move, attacks f3 and e2, but not much impact)
14. a7a6 (Pawn move, supports b5 pawn)
15. a7a5 (Pawn move, supports b5 pawn)

**Key considerations:**
- White's king is far from the queenside, so Black's queenside pawns are relatively safe.
- Black's bishop on a4 is well placed, but could be more active.
- Black's king could try to get closer to the queenside pawns to support promotion.
- Black's knight is not very active on h3; it could be repositioned.

**Critical lines:**
- If Black plays a4b3, attacking the d5 pawn, White may respond with d5d6, pushing the passed pawn.
- If Black plays c8c7, the king is closer to supporting the b6 pawn and possibly advancing the a-pawn.
- If Black plays a7a6, the pawn is protected and can support b5.

**Best move:**
- The move a4b3 attacks the d5 pawn, which is a critical passed pawn for White. If White pushes d5d6, Black can respond with Kd7, and the bishop on b3 controls the promotion square. This seems to be the most active and pressing move, putting pressure on White's center and potentially winning a pawn.

**Final move:**
```
a4b3
```

2025-06-22 11:42:48,551 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.57s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on c8, pawn on a7 and b6, bishop on b3, knight on h3.
- White: King on f3, pawns on d4, d5, b5, bishop on e3.

**Material:**
- Black: 2 pawns, bishop, knight
- White: 4 pawns, bishop

**King Safety:**
- Both kings are relatively safe, but White's king is more centralized.

**Pawn Structure:**
- Black's a7 and b6 are weak, but White's pawns are advanced and connected.
- Black's bishop on b3 is active, controlling the d1-h5 diagonal and supporting b5 pawn push.

**Threats:**
- White's d5 and b5 pawns are dangerous.
- Black's knight on h3 is awkward but can jump to more active squares.
- Black's bishop on b3 is well-placed, potentially supporting a passed pawn.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **b3d5**: Bishop to d5, attacking the e4 pawn and centralizing the bishop.
2. **h3g5**: Knight to g5, attacking the e4 pawn and threatening checks.
3. **h3f4**: Knight to f4, attacking the e2 square and centralizing.
4. **c8d8**: King to d8, centralizing the king.
5. **a7a6**: Pawn to a6, supporting b5 push.
6. **b6b5**: Pawn to b5, but not possible since b5 is occupied by White.

**Deep Analysis:**
- **b3d5**: If Bxd5, exd5, Black gets a passed pawn but loses the bishop pair. White's king is closer to the queenside pawns.
- **h3g5**: Knight to g5 attacks e4, but White can defend with Kf4 or move the bishop.
- **h3f4**: Knight to f4 attacks e2, but White can play Bxf4, exf4, and then push d6.
- **c8d8**: King to d8 is slow and doesn't address the immediate threats.
- **a7a6**: Prepares to support b5, but White can play bxa6.

**Best Move:**
- **b3d5** is the most active, centralizing the bishop, attacking e4, and possibly threatening Bxf3+ in some lines. It also keeps the knight on h3, which can jump to g5 or f4 later.

**Final Move:**
```
b3d5

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on c8, bishop on d5, pawn on a7 and b6, knight on h3.
- White: King on g3, bishop on e3, pawns on b5 and d4.

**Material:**
- Black: 2 pawns, bishop, knight, king.
- White: 2 pawns, bishop, king.

**Key features:**
- Black is up a minor piece (knight).
- White's king is somewhat exposed on g3.
- Black's bishop on d5 is very active, controlling many squares.
- Black's knight on h3 is not doing much but could be repositioned.
- White's bishop on e3 is defensive, covering key squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d5e6**: Attack the b3 pawn, but White doesn't have a pawn on b3.
2. **d5e4**: Centralize the bishop, but it's already well placed.
3. **d5g8**: Retreat, but unnecessary.
4. **d5f3**: Check, but White can capture with the bishop.
5. **h3g5**: Bring the knight back into play, attacking the e4 and f3 squares.
6. **a7a6**: Defend the b5 pawn, but not urgent.
7. **c8d7**: Activate the king.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The knight on h3 is out of play. Bringing it back via g5 or f4 could be useful.
- The bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal.
- The king can be activated to support the queenside pawns.

**Best move:**
- **h3g5** stands out. It brings the knight back into play, attacks the e4 and f3 squares, and prepares to support the advance of the queenside pawns. White's king is cut off from the queenside, and Black can push the a- and b-pawns in the future. There are no immediate threats from White.

**Final move:**

- White's king is far from the queenside, so Black's a- and b-pawns could become dangerous.
- White's bishop on g5 is not attacking any pawns directly but could become active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c8b8** (King to b8): Prepares to support the b6-pawn and potentially push the a-pawn.
2. **c8d7** (King to d7): Centralizes the king, but may allow White to attack the b6-pawn.
3. **a7a6** (Pawn to a6): Prepares to push b5, but White can play bxa6.
4. **d5e6** (Bishop to e6): Defends the b6-pawn, but less active than on d5.
5. **d5c4** (Bishop to c4): Attacks the b5-pawn, but White can defend with Be3.
6. **d5b7** (Bishop to b7): Defends b6, but less active.
7. **d5e4** (Bishop to e4): Centralizes and attacks the g2-square, but White can play Kf4.

**Key considerations:**
- Black's king is needed to support the queenside pawns.
- The bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling both promotion squares for the b- and a-pawns.
- White's king is far from the queenside, so Black can try to activate the king and push the pawns.

**Best plan:**  
Bring the king closer to the queenside pawns to support their advance. The move **Kb8** is safe and prepares to push the a-pawn. The bishop on d5 is well-placed and should not be moved unless necessary.

**Final move:**
```
c8b8

2025-06-22 11:43:12,310 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.62s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on b8, Bishop on d5, pawns on a7, b6
- White: King on h2, Bishop on g5, pawns on b5, d4

**Positional factors:**
- Black is up a pawn (2 vs 2), but White's pawns are more advanced and connected.
- Black's king is on b8, White's king is far away on h2.
- Black's bishop is centralized and controls many squares.
- White's bishop is on g5, attacking d5 and covering the b2 promotion square.
- Black's a7 pawn is backward, but can advance.
- Black's b6 pawn is blockaded by White's b5 pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a7a6**: Prepares to play a6xb5 if White pushes bxa6, but doesn't change much.
2. **d5e6**: Retreats bishop, but loses central control.
3. **d5c4**: Attacks d4 pawn, but White can defend with Be3.
4. **d5f3+**: Check, but White plays Kh3 or Kh1, not much gained.
5. **d5b7**: Defends b6, but not necessary now.
6. **d5g8**: Passive, not needed.
7. **b8c8**: King move, but doesn't improve position.
8. **d5e4**: Attacks d4 pawn, but White can defend with Be3.
9. **d5g2**: Attacks h2, but White king can move.

**Best plan:**
- Black's main advantage is the passed a-pawn. The bishop should support its advance.
- White's king is far from the queenside, so Black can try to create a passed pawn and promote.
- The bishop on d5 is well placed, controlling the b3 square and supporting a7-a5-a4.

**Move calculation:**
- If **a7a5**, White cannot stop a4 easily. If bxa6, then bxa6 and the b-pawn is passed.
- If **a7a6**, White can play bxa6, bxa6, and then try to push d5.
- If **d5c4**, White can play Be3, defending d4.
- If **d5e4**, White can play Be3.

**Key move:**
- **a7a5** is not in the legal moves list, but **a7a6** is. Let's check if **a7a6** is best.

After **a7a6**:
- If White plays bxa6, then bxa6, and Black has a passed a-pawn.
- If White does nothing, Black can play a5 next.

**Conclusion:**
- **a7a6** is the best move, preparing to create a passed pawn and using the bishop to support its advance.

Final move:
```
a7a6
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on b8, pawns on a6 and b6, bishop on d5
- White: King on h2, bishop on d8, pawns on b5, d4

**Material:**
- Both sides have a bishop and two pawns, but White's bishop is far from the action and the king is cut off.

**Key factors:**
- Black's king is safe.
- Black's bishop is active, controlling many squares.
- Black's pawns are connected and can advance.
- White's king is far from the queenside and cannot help stop the pawns.
- White's bishop is on d8, not immediately threatening anything.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a6a5: Start pushing the a-pawn.
2. b6b5: Push the b-pawn.
3. d5c6: Retreat bishop to support pawn push.
4. d5e4: Centralize bishop, but not necessary.
5. d5b7: Defend b6, but not needed now.
6. d5e6: Defend b6, but not needed.
7. d5g8: Attack bishop, but not effective.
8. d5a8: Attack bishop, not effective.

**Critical lines:**
- If we push a6-a5, White cannot stop both pawns.
- If we push b6-b5, White can play Bxb6, so that's not good.
- If we play a6-a5, White's bishop can't stop both pawns, and the king is too far.

**Best move:**
- a6a5 is the most direct and strong. The plan is to play a5-a4, b6-b5, and promote one of the pawns. White's king is too far to help.

**Final move:**
```
a6a5

2025-06-22 11:43:27,113 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.86s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (b8), Bishop (d5), Pawns (b6, a5)
- White: King (h2), Bishop (h4), Pawns (b5, d4)

**Position:**
- Black is up a pawn.
- White's king is far from the queenside, where the action is.
- Black's bishop is centralized and controls key diagonals.
- White's bishop is on h4, not very active.
- Black's a5 and b6 pawns are connected and can become dangerous passed pawns.
- White's b5 pawn is blockaded by Black's b6 pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a5a4**: Advance the a-pawn, creating a passed pawn. White cannot stop both pawns easily.
2. **d5c4**: Attack the b5 pawn, but White can defend with d4-d5.
3. **d5e6**: Prepare to support pawn advance, but not urgent.
4. **b8c8**: King move, but not urgent.
5. **d5b3**: Attack the b5 pawn, but White can defend.
6. **d5e4**: Centralize bishop, but not as forcing.

**Critical analysis:**
- **a5a4** is the most direct and challenging move for White. If White tries to stop the a-pawn with d4-d5, Black can play a4-a3, and the b-pawn is ready to advance as well.
- White's king is too far to help.
- White's bishop is out of play.

**Tactics:**
- After **a5a4**, if White plays d4-d5, then a4-a3, and the pawns are unstoppable.
- If White tries to bring the bishop back, it's too slow.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the a-pawn and create a decisive passed pawn.

2025-06-22 11:43:35,712 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.23s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (b8), Bishop (d5), Pawn (b6), Pawn (a4)
- White: King (h2), Bishop (f6), Pawn (b5), Pawn (d4)

**Positional factors:**
- Black is up a pawn (4 vs 3).
- Black's a4 pawn is advanced and could become a passed pawn.
- White's king is far from the queenside action.
- White's bishop is active on f6, but can't immediately threaten Black's pawns.
- Black's bishop on d5 is central and controls many squares.

**Candidate moves:**
- a4-a3: Pushes the passed pawn, but White can play Be7 and then Bxa3 if not careful.
- b8-c8 or b8-a8: King moves, but not urgent.
- d5-e6: Attacks the b5 pawn, but White can defend with Be5.
- d5-c4: Attacks the b5 pawn, but White can play Be5.
- d5-b7: Defends b6, but not necessary now.
- d5-f3: Attacks h2, but White's king is safe for now.
- d5-g8: Not useful.
- a4-a3: The most direct way to create a passed pawn.

**Tactical considerations:**
- If a4-a3, White can't stop the pawn with the bishop immediately, and the king is too far.
- If White tries to bring the bishop to e7, Black can play a2 and then b2, and the pawn will queen.
- If White plays Be5+, Black can play Kb7 and then push the pawn.

**Calculation:**
1. a4-a3
   - If White plays Be7, then a2, and the pawn is unstoppable.
   - If White plays d4-d5, Black can play a2, and the pawn is unstoppable.
   - If White plays Be5+, Black can play Kb7, and the pawn is still unstoppable.

**Conclusion:**
The move a4-a3 is the most direct and winning plan, as White cannot stop the a-pawn from queening.

2025-06-22 11:43:45,880 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.37s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (b8), Bishop (d5), Pawn (a3), Pawn (b6)
- White: King (h2), Bishop (h4), Pawn (b5), Pawn (d4)

**Position:**
- Black has a passed a-pawn on a3, which is two squares from promotion.
- White's king is far away on h2, and White's bishop is on h4, controlling the a1-h8 diagonal.
- Black's bishop is centralized on d5, controlling many squares.
- White has a pawn on d4 and b5.

**Immediate threats and plans:**
- Black's a-pawn is very close to queening, but White's bishop can control the promotion square.
- Black's bishop can support the a-pawn or try to restrict White's bishop.
- White's king is too far to help immediately.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a3a2**: Push the pawn. White can play Bg3+ or Bg5, but the pawn is one step from queening.
2. **d5e4**: Attack the bishop, but White's bishop is not under attack.
3. **d5c4**: Attack the b5 pawn.
4. **d5e6**: Defend the a2 square.
5. **d5g8**: Not relevant.
6. **b8c8**: King move, not urgent.

**Critical analysis:**
- **a3a2** is the most forcing move. After a3a2, White must stop the pawn from queening. The only way is to keep the bishop on the a1-h8 diagonal (e.g., Bg3+ or Bg5). If White's bishop leaves the diagonal, Black queens.
- After a3a2, Black can try to support the pawn with the bishop or king, or try to exchange bishops (which would win).

**Is there any danger?**
- White's king is too far to help.
- White's bishop can only stop the pawn by staying on the diagonal.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the a-pawn.

2025-06-22 11:43:56,469 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.54s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on b8, pawn on b6, pawn on a2, bishop on d5
- White: King on h2, bishop on g3, pawn on b5, pawn on d4

**Material:**
- Black: King, bishop, 2 pawns (a2, b6)
- White: King, bishop, 2 pawns (b5, d4)

**Key points:**
- Black's a2 pawn is one step from queening, but White's bishop on g3 controls a1.
- Black's b6 pawn is blockaded by White's b5 pawn.
- Black's bishop on d5 is well-placed, controlling the a8 square and helping support the a2 pawn.
- White's king is far away on h2, so White cannot immediately attack Black's pawns.
- Black's king is on b8, currently blocking the a8 promotion square.

**Legal moves:**
- b8c8
- b8a8
- b8b7
- b8a7

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b8c8**: Moves the king away from the a-file, allowing the a2 pawn to promote next move. However, White can play Bf4+, forcing the king back to b7 or b8, and then White can try to blockade the a-pawn with the bishop.
2. **b8a8**: Keeps the king on the a-file, but does not help promote the pawn.
3. **b8b7**: Moves the king to b7, still blocks the a-pawn.
4. **b8a7**: Moves the king to a7, but then the king is on the edge and not helping.

**Deep analysis:**
- If 1... b8c8, 2. Bf4 (threatening to blockade the pawn), then 2... Kd7 (trying to bring the king to support the pawn), but White can play 3. Bc1, blockading the pawn.
- If 1... b8a8, White can play Be5, attacking the bishop and preparing to blockade the pawn.
- If 1... b8b7, White can play Be5, again attacking the bishop.
- If 1... b8a7, White can play Be5, and the king is stuck on the edge.

**Best move:**
- The most promising is **b8c8**, as it allows the a2 pawn to promote next move. After 2. Bf4, Black can play Kd7, and after 3. Bc1, Black can play Bc4, threatening to exchange bishops and promote the pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b8c8
```

2025-06-22 11:44:03,650 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.30s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on c8, bishop on d5, pawn on a2, pawn on b6
- White: King on h2, bishop on f2, pawn on b5, pawn on d4

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's a2 pawn is one step from promotion.
- White's king is far from the action.
- White's bishop on f2 can potentially stop the a-pawn, but only if it can get to a1 or b2 in time.
- Black's bishop on d5 controls the a8 square and can help support the pawn's promotion.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Promote the a2 pawn: a2a1Q, a2a1R, a2a1B, a2a1N
2. Move the bishop: d5g8, d5a8, etc.
3. Move the king: c8d8, c8b8, etc.

**Analysis:**
- Promoting the pawn is the most forcing move. The only question is which piece to promote to.
- a2a1Q is the most natural, as it gives Black a queen and should be winning.
- Is there any danger of stalemate? Let's check:
    - After a2a1Q, White's king on h2 has g1 and h1 available, so not stalemate.
    - White can try to check with the bishop, but Black's king is safe and can hide on b7 or d7.
    - Black's bishop and queen will easily overpower White's bishop and pawns.

**Conclusion:**
- Promoting to a queen is the best move.

Final move:
```
a2a1q

2025-06-22 11:44:10,383 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.76s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Bishop (d5), King (c8), Pawn (b6)
- White: King (h2), Bishop (h4), Pawn (b5), Pawn (d4)

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen for a bishop and has a pawn.
- White's king is on h2, far from the action.
- Black's queen is on a1, bishop on d5, king on c8.
- White's bishop is on h4, pawns on b5 and d4.

**Immediate threats:**
- No immediate mate threats from White.
- Black can try to coordinate queen and bishop for mate or to win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a1h1+**: Queen check, forces White's king to move to g3 or h3.
2. **a1h8+**: Queen check, but White can block with bishop.
3. **a1a2**: Queen attacks d4 pawn.
4. **d5g8**: Bishop attacks king, but not useful.
5. **d5e4**: Bishop centralizes, but not a threat.
6. **a1h4**: Queen takes bishop, but that's not possible since bishop is on h4.

**Best plan:**
- Deliver checks to drive the king to a vulnerable square, or win the bishop.
- a1h1+ is forcing.

**After 1...Qa1-h1+:**
- 2. Kg3 (forced)
- Then Qg1+ or Qe1+ can continue the attack.

Let's check if there's a forced mate or win of material.

**1...Qa1-h1+ 2.Kg3 (forced)**
- 2...Qg1+ 3.Kf4 (only move)
- 3...Qxd4+ wins the pawn with check, and the king is exposed.

Alternatively, after 1...Qa1-h1+ 2.Kg3, Black can play ...Qe1+ or ...Qe4, but Qg1+ is more forcing.

**Conclusion:**
The most forcing move is:
```
a1h1
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/8/1p6/1P1b4/3P3B/6K1/8/7q b - - 3 64

**Material:**
- Black: King on c8, Bishop on d5, Queen on h1, Pawn on b6
- White: King on g3, Bishop on h4, Pawn on b5, Pawn on d4

**White King:** g3  
**Black Queen:** h1  
**Black Bishop:** d5  
**Black Pawn:** b6  
**Black King:** c8

**White threats:** None immediate. White's king is exposed, and Black's queen and bishop are well placed.

**Black threats:** Black's queen on h1 and bishop on d5 are coordinating well. The White king is on g3, and the bishop on h4 is pinned to the king by the queen on h1.

**Candidate moves:**
- h1g2+ (Queen check)
- h1e4 (Queen attacks bishop and threatens mate ideas)
- d5g8 (Bishop check, but doesn't seem to lead anywhere)
- d5e4 (Bishop attacks bishop)
- h1h4 (Queen takes bishop, but is it safe?)
- h1h3 (Queen check)
- h1h2 (Queen check)
- h1g1 (Queen check)
- h1f1 (Queen check)
- h1e1 (Queen check)

**Immediate checks:**
- h1g1+ (King can go to f4 or h3)
- h1h3+ (King can go to f4 or f2)
- h1g2+ (King can go to f4 or f2)

Let's look at the most forcing moves: checks.

1. **h1g1+**
   - If Kg3-f4, then ...Qxd4 is possible, but White can play Bf2.
   - If Kg3-h3, then ...Qg2# is mate.

But after h1g1+, White can play Kf4, and the king escapes.

2. **h1h3+**
   - If Kg3-f4, then ...Qxh4 is possible, but White can play Kg5.
   - If Kg3-f2, then ...Qxh4 is possible, but White can play Kg1.

3. **h1g2+**
   - If Kg3-f4, then ...Qxh4 is possible, but White can play Kg5.
   - If Kg3-f2, then ...Qxh4 is possible, but White can play Kg1.

4. **h1h4**
   - Queen takes bishop, but is it safe? Let's check:
     - h1h4, Kg3xh4, then ...b6b5, but White is up a piece.
     - h1h4, Kg3f4, then ...Qxh4, but White can play Kg5.

5. **h1e4**
   - Queen attacks bishop and threatens mate ideas.

But let's check for mate in one: is there a mate in one?
- h1g2+ Kg3f4, no mate.
- h1g2+ Kg3f2, no mate.
- h1h3+ Kg3f4, no mate.
- h1h3+ Kg3f2, no mate.
- h1h4, not mate.

But what about h1g2+? Let's check the lines:

**Line 1: h1g2+**
- If Kg3f4, then ...Qxh4 is possible, but White can play Kg5.
- If Kg3f2, then ...Qxh4, White can play Kg1.

**Line 2: h1h3+**
- If Kg3f4, then ...Qxh4, White can play Kg5.
- If Kg3f2, then ...Qxh4, White can play Kg1.

**Line 3: h1h4**
- Queen takes bishop, but King can escape.

**Line 4: h1e4**
- Queen attacks bishop, but not a check.

**Line 5: d5e4**
- Bishop takes bishop, but not a check.

**Line 6: h1h2**
- Queen check, King can go to f4 or f2.

**Is there a forced mate?**

Let's try h1g1+:

- h1g1+ Kg3f4
- ...Qxd4 (threatening mate on f2)
- White plays Bf2 to block, but then ...Qxf2+ and mate soon.

But let's check h1g1+ Kg3h3:

- h1g1+ Kg3h3
- ...Qh1# is mate.

So, **h1g1+** forces mate if the king goes to h3.

If White plays Kg3f4, then ...Qxd4 is very strong.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h1g1+
```

2025-06-22 11:44:29,145 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.99s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/8/1p6/1P1b4/3P3B/7K/8/6q1 b - - 5 65

**Black:** King on c8, Bishop on d5, Pawn on b6, Queen on g1  
**White:** King on h3, Bishop on h4, Pawn on b5, Pawn on d4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black is up a queen and bishop for a bishop (and a pawn). White's king is exposed on h3, and Black's queen is very active.

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black's queen on g1 is menacing.  
- White's king is on h3, with no pawn cover and only the bishop on h4 nearby.  
- Black can look for forced mates or ways to win more material.

**Candidate moves:**  
- g1g2+ (check, but White can block with Bishop or move King to h4)
- g1h1+ (check, but White can move King to g4 or h4)
- d5g2 (threatens mate on h1, but not immediate)
- d5e6 (improves bishop, but not forcing)
- d5g8 (retreats bishop, not threatening)
- g1g4 (check, but White can block with Bishop or move King)
- g1h2+ (forces King to g4 or h4, but not mate)

Let's calculate the most forcing lines:

**1. g1g2+**  
- If White plays Bxg2, Black can play Bxg2# (but that's not possible, as the bishop is on d5).
- If White plays Kg4, then Qf3# is not possible (bishop covers f3).
- If White plays Kg3, then Qxg3# is mate.

But after g1g2+, White can only play Bxg2 or Kg4.

**2. g1h1+**  
- If White plays Kg4, then Qxh4# is mate (since the bishop on d5 covers f3 and g4 squares).
- If White plays Kg3, then Qxh4# is mate.

Let's check this in detail:

**g1h1+**
- Kg4: Qxh4#
- Kg3: Qxh4#
- Bh2: Qxh2#

So, **g1h1+** is a forced mate in 1, as White's only legal moves after g1h1+ are Kg4, Kg3, or Bh2, all of which are met by Qxh4# or Qxh2#.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g1h1
```

2025-06-22 11:44:36,081 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.97s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/8/1p6/1P1b4/3P2KB/8/8/7q b - - 7 66

**Black:** King on c8, Bishop on d5, Pawn on b6, Queen on h1  
**White:** King on g4, Bishop on h4, Pawn on b5, Pawn on d4

**White's threats:**  
- White's king is exposed, but there are no immediate threats to Black.
- White's bishop on h4 is not attacking anything critical.

**Black's plan:**  
- Black is up a queen and bishop for a bishop, with a passed pawn on b6.
- White's king is exposed, and Black's queen is very active.
- Black should look for a forced mate or a way to win material.

**Candidate moves:**  
- h1g2+ (Queen check)
- h1e4+ (Queen check)
- d5e6 (Bishop move, not a check)
- d5e4 (Bishop takes pawn, not a check)
- d5g8 (Bishop check, but White king can escape)
- d5f3 (Bishop check, but White king can escape)

Let's check the checks first:

1. **h1g2+**  
   - White's only legal move is to take with the bishop: Bxg2.
   - Then Black can play Bxg2, and White's king is still exposed.
   - But this exchanges queens for bishop, which is not optimal since Black is up material and can press for more.

2. **h1e4+**  
   - White's only legal move is to take with the bishop: Bxe4.
   - Again, this exchanges queens for bishop, not optimal.

3. **h1h4**  
   - Queen takes bishop, winning a piece.

But let's check if there is a forced mate:

- After h1h4, White's king is on g4, and Black threatens Qh5#.
- White cannot stop Qh5# after h1h4.

Let's check:
- h1h4, White's only move is Kf5 or Kg5.
- If Kg5, then Qh5# is mate.
- If Kf5, then Qh5+ forces Kg5, and then Qh4#.

So, **h1h4** is a forced mate in two.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-22 11:44:41,642 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.34s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on c8, bishop on d5, queen on h4, pawn on b6.
- White: King on f5, pawns on b5, d4.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's queen on h4 is very active, and White's king is exposed.
- White has no immediate threats; the king is in a precarious position.
- Black can look for a forced mate or a decisive material gain.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h4h5+**: Queen check, forcing the king to move.
   - If Kf6, then ...Qh6# is mate.
   - If Kg6, then ...Bf7# is mate.
   - If Kf4, then ...Qh4+ repeats.
2. **h4g4+**: Queen check, but the king can go to f6 or f4.
3. **h4e4+**: Queen check, but White can block with the d4 pawn.
4. **d5e6+**: Bishop check, but White can go to f6 or e5.
5. **h4f4+**: Queen check, but White can go to g6 or f6.

**Calculation:**
- After **h4h5+**:
   - If Kf6, then Qh6# (mate).
   - If Kg6, then Bf7# (mate).
   - If Kf4, then Qh4+ repeats.

**Conclusion:**
- **h4h5+** is a forced mate in 1 or 2, depending on White's response.

**Best move:**
```
h4h5
```

2025-06-22 11:44:47,727 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.08s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/8/1p6/1P1b3q/3P1K2/8/8/8 b - - 3 68

**Black:** King on c8, Bishop on d5, Queen on h5, Pawn on b6  
**White:** King on f4, Pawn on b5, Pawn on d4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black is up a queen and bishop for two pawns.  
**King Safety:** White's king is exposed on f4.  
**Threats:** Black can look for checks and mating nets.

**Candidate moves:**
- h5f3+ (Queen check)
- h5h4+ (Queen check)
- d5e6 (Bishop check)
- h5h6 (Queen check)
- h5g4 (Queen check)
- h5f7 (Queen check)

Let's check each:

1. **h5f3+**: King can only go to g5 (as e5 is covered by bishop, e3 by queen, f5 by queen, f3 by queen, f4 is occupied).
   - After Kg5, Black can play Qg4# (checkmate).

2. **h5h4+**: King can go to e5 or f5.
   - If Ke5, Qe4# is mate.
   - If Kf5, Qh5# is mate.

But let's check the fastest mate:

- **h5f3+** Kg5 Qg4# (mate in 2)
- **h5h4+** Ke5 Qe4# (mate in 2)
- **h5h4+** Kf5 Qh5# (mate in 2)

So, both h5f3+ and h5h4+ lead to mate in 2.

But h5f3+ is more forcing, as it only allows Kg5, and then Qg4# is mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h5f3
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (c8), Queen (f3), Bishop (d5), Pawn (b6)
- White: King (e5), Pawns (b5, d4)

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen and bishop for two pawns.
- White's king is centralized but exposed.
- Black's queen is very active on f3, and the bishop on d5 controls key diagonals.
- White's pawns are not immediately threatening.

**Immediate threats:**
- No immediate mate threats from White.
- Black can look for checks, threats of mate, or winning more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Queen checks:** f3e4+, f3e3+, f3g3+, f3h5+, f3f5+, etc.
2. **Bishop moves:** d5e4+ (check), d5e6, etc.
3. **King moves:** c8d8, c8b8, etc.

**Tactical ideas:**
- f3e4+ forces the White king to move (d6 or f6), but after Kd6, there are no immediate mates.
- f3f7+ forces the king to f6 or d6.
- d5e4+ is a discovered check, but the king can move to e6 or f6.

**Best move search:**
- Let's check f3e4+:
    - 1... Qe4+ 2. Kd6 (if Kf6, Qf4+ wins the d4 pawn)
    - After 2. Kd6, Black can play Qe6+ and keep checking.
- Let's check d5e4+:
    - 1... Be4 2. Kxe4, then Qe4# is not possible because the king is on e4.
- Let's check f3f7+:
    - 1... Qf7 2. Kd6 (if Kf6, Qf6# is mate)
    - 2. Kd6, then Qd7+ wins the d4 pawn.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- After 1... Qf7+ 2. Kd6, 2... Qd7+ 3. Ke5, then Qe7+ and the king is forced to f4 or f5, but not mated yet.

**What about f3f5+?**
- 1... Qf5+ 2. Kd6 (if Kxf5, Bxd4 is winning)
- 2. Kd6, then Qe6+ and the king is forced to d5 or c6.

**What about f3f6+?**
- 1... Qf6+ 2. Kxd5 (if Kxf6, Bxd4 is winning)

Let's check this line:
1... Qf7+
2. Kd6 Qd7+
3. Ke5 Qe7+
4. Kf4 Qf6+

2025-06-22 11:45:07,018 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.93s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on c8, Queen on f7, Bishop on d5, pawns on b6
- White: King on d6, pawns on b5, d4

**King safety:**
- White's king is exposed on d6.
- Black's king is relatively safe.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens to check the White king with the queen.
- White has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
- Queen checks: f7f6+, f7e6+, f7g6+
- Bishop moves: d5e4+, d5c4+, d5b7+, d5e6+
- Queen attacks: f7d7+, f7c7+, f7b7+, f7a7+
- Quiet moves: c8d8, c8b8, b6b5

**Tactical ideas:**
- Black can try to force the White king into a mating net.
- The queen and bishop can coordinate for mate.

Let's check forcing moves:

1. **f7f6+** (Queen check)
   - White's only legal move: Kxd5 (since e5, c5, d7, d6 are all covered by queen or bishop)
   - After Kxd5, Black can play Qe6# (mate).

2. **f7e6+** (Queen check)
   - White's only legal move: Kxe6
   - After Kxe6, Black can play Bxe6# (mate).

3. **d5e4+** (Bishop check)
   - White's king can go to e5 or c6, not as forcing.

**Conclusion:**
Both f7f6+ and f7e6+ are mate in two. Let's verify:

- f7f6+ Kxd5 Qe6#
- f7e6+ Kxe6 Bxe6#

Both are mate in two, but f7f6+ is more direct and uses the queen for mate.

**Final move:**
```
f7f6
```

2025-06-22 11:45:12,851 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.92s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on c8, Queen on f6, Pawn on b6
- White: King on d5, Pawn on b5, Pawn on d4

**Material:** Black is up a queen and a pawn for two pawns. White's king is centralized but exposed.

**Threats:**
- White's only hope is to push pawns or try to use the king for shelter.
- Black can check the king, try to win pawns, or force a queen trade.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qf3+**: Forces the king to move, as the only squares are c4, c6, d6, e5, e4.
2. **Qf5+**: Similar, but White can block with the d4 pawn.
3. **Qf7**: Passive, no threat.
4. **Qe7**: Attacks the b4 square, but not forcing.
5. **Qf4**: Attacks d4 pawn.
6. **Qd8**: King move, but not necessary.

**Best plan:** 
- Black should use the queen to check and drive the king away from the pawns, then pick them off.
- Immediate checks are best to avoid any stalemate tricks or perpetuals.

**Calculation:**
- 1... Qf3+ 2. Kc4 (if Kd6, then Qf6+ wins d4 pawn) 
- After Kc4, Black can play ...Qe2+ or ...Qf7+ and keep checking, or start picking off pawns.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Not immediate, but Black can win all the pawns and force mate.

**Avoid stalemate:** White has pawns, so no stalemate yet.

**Final move:** The most forcing is to check the king and drive it away from the pawns.

2025-06-22 11:45:18,915 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.81s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on c8, Queen on f3, pawn on b6.
- White: King on d4, pawn on b5.

Material: Black is up a queen for a pawn. White's king is centralized, but Black's queen is extremely powerful and White has no immediate threats.

Immediate tactical considerations:
- White's king is exposed.
- Black's queen can check from many angles.
- Black must avoid stalemate and perpetual check.
- Black can try to force the white king away and promote the b-pawn.

Candidate moves:
1. **Qf3-f4+**: Forces the white king to move. If Kd5, then Qf5+ wins the pawn on b5. If Kc3, then Qe5+.
2. **Qf3-e3+**: Forces the king to c4 or d5. If Kd5, then Qe5+.
3. **Qf3-f1**: Threatens to invade the first rank, but doesn't check.
4. **Qf3-f5**: Attacks the b5 pawn directly.
5. **Qf3-d1+**: Forces the king to c3 or e4.

Let's check the most forcing move: **Qf3-f4+**

- If Kd5, then Qf5+ and Black wins the b5 pawn.
- If Kc3, then Qe5+ and again Black wins the b5 pawn.
- If Kd3, then Qf5+ and again Black wins the b5 pawn.

So, **Qf3-f4+** seems to win the b5 pawn next move, after which Black's b6 pawn will be unstoppable.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f3f4
```

2025-06-22 11:45:25,889 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.83s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/8/1p6/1P6/3P1q2/2K5/8/8 b - - 4 73

- Black: King on c8, Queen on f4, pawn on b6
- White: King on c3, pawns on b5, d4

White's king is cut off from the b-pawn, but the d-pawn is dangerous and can advance. Black's queen is very active and can check or attack pawns. The Black king is relatively safe for now.

**Immediate threats:**
- White may try to push d5 and then d6, but the queen can harass the king and pawns.
- Black can try to check the king, win pawns, or support the b-pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f4c1+**: Check, forcing the king to b3 or d3. If Kb3, then Qb1+ wins the b5 pawn.
2. **f4f3+**: Check, but the king can go to c4, still protecting the b5 pawn.
3. **f4f5**: Attacks the d5 square, but not a check.
4. **f4g3+**: Check, but king can go to c4.
5. **f4f8**: Passive, not useful.
6. **f4e4**: Attacks the d4 pawn, but not a check.

**Calculation:**
- After **f4c1+**, if Kb3, then Qb1+ Kc4 Qc2+ Kd5 Qf5+ wins the d4 pawn or forces the king away.
- If Kd3, then Qb1+ Kc4 Qc2+ Kd5 Qf5+ again.

**Let's check the line:**
1. ... Qc1+ 2. Kb3 (if Kd3, similar) Qb1+ 3. Kc4 Qc2+ 4. Kd5 Qf5+ 5. Kc4 (if Kd6, Qf8 wins the pawn) ... Qe6+ and Black can keep checking or win pawns.

**Alternative:**
- If Black plays Qf3+, White can play Kc4, still protecting the b5 pawn.

**Conclusion:**
- **Qc1+** is the most forcing move, driving the king away and picking up pawns.

My move:
```
f4c1
```

2025-06-22 11:45:33,307 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.20s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/8/1p6/1P6/1K1P4/8/8/2q5 b - - 6 74

**Black:** King on c8, Queen on c1, pawn on b6  
**White:** King on b4, pawns on b5 and d4

**Material:** Black is up a queen for two pawns.  
**Threats:** White's only hope is to promote a pawn, but Black's queen is well placed to stop this. Black's king is safe.

**Immediate Tactics:**  
- The white king is on b4, and the only two pawns are b5 and d4.
- Black's queen on c1 can check the white king from several squares.
- Black can also consider picking up pawns or going for mate.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **c1b2+**: Check, forces the king to a4 or c4.
2. **c1d2+**: Check, king can go to a4 or c4.
3. **c1e3**: Attacks the d4 pawn.
4. **c1b1+**: Check, king can go to a4 or c4.
5. **c1c3**: Attacks the d4 pawn directly.
6. **c1c7**: Defends b7 square, but not necessary.
7. **c1c4**: Attacks the king directly, but the king can take the queen.

**Best Plan:**  
- Black should check the king and try to pick up pawns, while avoiding stalemate.
- **c1b2+** is a forcing check. Let's see the responses:
    - If Kc4, then Qc2+ picks up the d4 pawn.
    - If Ka4, then Qxd4 is possible.

Let's check for stalemate traps:
- If the white king is driven to a4 and Black takes all pawns, be careful not to stalemate.

**Calculation:**
1. **c1b2+** Kc4 Qc2+ Kd5 (forced) Qb3+ Kc6 Qxb5, and Black wins easily.
2. **c1b2+** Ka4 Qxd4+ Kb3 Qd5+ Kc3 Qxb5, again Black wins.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is a check that forces the white king away from the pawns and allows Black to pick them up.  
Therefore, the best move is:

```
c1b2

2025-06-22 11:45:39,651 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.30s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on c8, pawn on b6, queen on b2
- White: King on a4, pawn on b5, pawn on d4

**Material:** Black is up a queen for two pawns.

**Threats:**
- White's king is exposed on a4.
- White has two connected passed pawns, but they are not immediately dangerous.
- Black's queen is extremely active and can harass the white king or target the pawns.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- Check if there are any forced mates or ways to win material.
- Look for checks with the queen: b2xa2, b2c2, b2d4, b2b5, b2b4, b2b3, b2a3, b2a1, etc.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **b2a2+**: King must move to b4 or a3.
   - If Ka4-b4, then Qb2xd4+ picks up the pawn with check.
   - If Ka4-a3, then Qb2xa3# is checkmate.
2. **b2d4**: Grabs a pawn, but not with check.
3. **b2b5**: Captures the pawn, but not with check.
4. **b2b4+**: King moves to a3 or b3.
   - If Ka4-a3, then Qb2xa3# is checkmate.
   - If Ka4-b3, then Qb2xb5+ picks up the pawn.
5. **b2c2+**: King moves to a3 or b4.
   - If Ka4-a3, then Qb2xa3# is checkmate.
   - If Ka4-b4, then Qb2xd4+.

**Best Move:**
- **b2a2+** is the strongest. If White plays Ka4-a3, then Qb2xa3# is mate. If Ka4-b4, then Qb2xd4+ picks up the pawn with check, and Black will easily win.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b2a2
```

2025-06-22 11:45:45,326 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.84s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on c8, pawn on b6, queen on a2
- White: King on b4, pawn on d4, pawn on b5

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen for two pawns.
- White's king is exposed on b4.
- Black's queen is active on a2, and White's pawns are not immediately threatening.

**Immediate threats:**
- No immediate mate threats from White.
- Black can consider checks, picking up pawns, or cutting off the White king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a2b2+**: Check, forces White's king to a3 or c3.
2. **a2a5**: Attacks the d4 pawn and keeps White's king cut off.
3. **a2a1**: Keeps the queen on the long diagonal, but less active.
4. **a2a4**: Attacks the d4 pawn and keeps the king cut off.
5. **c8d8**: King move, not urgent.

**Let's analyze a2b2+:**
- If Kc4, then Qxb5+ picks up a pawn.
- If Ka3, then Qxb5 wins a pawn.
- If Kc3, then Qxb5 wins a pawn.

So, a2b2+ seems to win the b5 pawn, simplifying the position and making the win easier.

**Is there any better move?**
- a2a5 or a2a4 attacks d4, but White can defend with Kc4 or Ka4.
- a2b2+ is forcing and wins a pawn.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to check with the queen and pick up the b5 pawn.

```
a2b2

2025-06-22 11:45:50,921 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.57s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on c8, pawn on b6, queen on b2
- White: King on d4, pawn on b5

**Material:** Black is up a queen for a pawn.

**Threats:**
- White has no immediate threats. The b5 pawn is blockaded by Black's b6 pawn.
- Black's queen is extremely active and can check the White king or start picking up pawns.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **b2d4+**: Check the White king. White must move the king, and Black can continue checking or start picking up pawns.
2. **b2b5**: Captures the pawn, but does not check.
3. **b2b4**: Captures the pawn, but does not check.
4. **b2c3+**: Check the White king, but White can move to d5 or e4.
5. **King moves**: Not urgent, as the king is safe.
6. **b2b3**: Not urgent.

**Analysis:**
- **b2d4+**: This move checks the White king and forces it to move. After the king moves, Black can continue checking or start picking up pawns. This keeps the initiative and prevents White from activating their king or pushing the b-pawn.
- **b2b5**: Captures the pawn, but White's king is still active and can try to approach the b6 pawn.
- **b2c3+**: Also a check, but less forcing than b2d4+.

**Best Move:**
- **b2d4+** is the most forcing move, keeping the White king cut off and maintaining the initiative. Black can then proceed to pick up pawns or force the king further away.

My move:
```
b2d4
```

2025-06-22 11:45:56,618 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.94s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on c8, Queen on d4, Pawn on b6
- White: King on b3, Pawn on b5

**Material:** Black is up a queen for a pawn, a decisive advantage.

**Threats:**
- White's only hope is to push the b-pawn, but it's easily blockaded or captured.
- Black's queen is extremely active and can deliver checks or force the white king away from the pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4d3+**: Check, forcing the white king to move. If Kb4, then Qd4+ picks up the pawn.
2. **d4d5**: Attacks the pawn, but doesn't force anything.
3. **d4c5**: Attacks the pawn, but doesn't force anything.
4. **d4e3+**: Check, but the king can go to a4 or b4.
5. **d4d1+**: Check, but the king can go to a2 or b2.
6. **d4d5**: Attacks the pawn, but not as forcing as a check.

**Best plan:** Use checks to drive the white king away from the b5 pawn, then capture it. After that, Black can easily win with queen and king vs king.

**Calculation:**
- 1... Qd3+ 2. Kb4 (if Ka4, then Qc4# is mate)
- 1... Qd3+ 2. Ka2 (if Ka4, Qc4#)
- 1... Qd3+ 2. Kb2 (then Qxb5+ wins the pawn immediately)

Let's check the lines:
- 1... Qd3+ 2. Kb2 Qxb5+ 3. Kc3 (or Ka3) Qc5+ and Black wins easily.

**Is there a mate?**
- 1... Qd3+ 2. Ka4 Qc4# is mate.

**Conclusion:** The move 1... Qd3+ is the most forcing and can lead to immediate mate if White blunders, or wins the pawn otherwise.

My move:
```
d4d3
```

2025-06-22 11:46:02,077 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.77s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on c8, Queen on d3, Pawn on b6
- White: King on b2, Pawn on b5

**Material:** Black is up a queen and a pawn for a pawn.
**Threats:** 
- White has no immediate threats. 
- Black can deliver checks and look for a forced mate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
- Queen checks: d3d2+, d3d4+, d3d5+, d3d1+, d3b5+, d3c2+, d3b3+, d3a3+, d3f1+, d3f3+, d3h3+, d3g3+, d3e3+, d3e2+, d3c3+, d3d6+, d3g6+, d3h7+, d3d7+, d3d8+
- King moves: c8d8, c8b8, c8d7, c8c7, c8b7

**Analysis:**
- The White king is on b2, so checks on the b-file or a3 are interesting.
- d3b5+ is a check, but White can block with the pawn (b5).
- d3b3+ forces the king to a1 or b1.
- d3c2+ forces the king to a1 or b1.
- d3d2+ forces the king to a3 or b1.
- d3a3+ forces the king to b1.

Let’s look at d3b3+:
- 1... Qb3+ 2. Ka1 (only move)
- Now, Qc3+ is mate.

Let’s check:
1... Qb3+ 2. Ka1 Qc3#

This is a forced mate in two.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d3b3
```

2025-06-22 11:46:06,766 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.04s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on c8, pawn on b6
- White: King on b3, pawn on b5

It's Black to move.

Material: Equal pawns, but both are passed pawns. The kings are close to the pawns.

Key points:
- If Black pushes the pawn (b6-b5), White can capture (b5xb6) and then White's king will escort the pawn.
- If Black moves the king, White may try to invade or push their pawn.
- The Black king must stay close to the b6 pawn to support its advance and also prevent White's king from invading.

Let's consider the candidate moves:

1. **c8d8**: King moves toward the center, but White can play Kc4, attacking the b6 pawn.
2. **c8b8**: King stays close to the pawn, but White can play Kc4, again threatening the pawn.
3. **c8d7**: King moves toward the center, but White can play Kc4.
4. **c8c7**: King stays on the same file, but White can play Kc4.
5. **c8b7**: King moves to b7, directly protecting the b6 pawn.

If Black plays **c8b7**, the king is directly protecting the pawn and prevents White's king from attacking it. If White plays Kc4, Black can play Kc7, and the pawn is still protected.

Therefore, the best move is to play **c8b7**, keeping the king close to the pawn and preventing White's king from attacking it.

Final move:
```
c8b7
```

2025-06-22 11:46:12,321 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.06s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on b7, pawn on b6
- White: King on a3, pawn on b5

It's Black to move.

White's plan is to push the b-pawn and try to queen. Black's king is in front of the pawn, which is ideal for stopping it. The Black pawn on b6 is also a useful shield.

Let's look at the candidate moves:

1. **b7c8**: King moves away from the pawn, allowing White to play b6 and then b7, which is dangerous.
2. **b7b8**: King stays in front of the pawn, but on the back rank. After b6, Ka8, b7+ Kb8, Ka6, and White queens.
3. **b7a8**: King moves to the corner. After b6, Ka7, b7, Kb8, Ka6, and White queens.
4. **b7c7**: King moves to c7, staying close to the pawn. After b6+, Kc8, Ka6, Kb8, Kxb6, Black loses the pawn.
5. **b7a7**: King moves to a7, staying in front of the pawn. After b6+, Ka8, Ka6, Kb8, Kxb6, Black loses the pawn.

The best move is to keep the king in front of the pawn and not allow White to make progress. Let's check the opposition:

If 1... Kc7, 2. Kb4 Kd6, 3. Kc4 Ke5, but White can push b6 and try to make progress.

But if 1... Kc8, White plays Kb4, Kb7, Ka4, and Black can keep the opposition.

But in this position, the best move is to keep the king in front of the pawn and not allow White to make progress. The move 1... Kc7 keeps the opposition and prevents White from advancing.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b7c7
```

2025-06-22 11:46:17,538 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.72s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

- Black: King on c7, pawn on b6
- White: King on a4, pawn on b5

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Equal pawns, but Black's king is closer to the queening square of the b-pawn. White's king is far from the action.

**Immediate threats:** White's pawn is on b5, but Black's pawn is on b6 and can advance. Black's king is well-placed to support the pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c7d6: Centralizes the king, but doesn't help the pawn advance immediately.
2. c7d7: Similar, but doesn't help much.
3. c7b7: Moves king behind the pawn, but not optimal.
4. c7b8: Retreats, not useful.
5. c7c8: Retreats, not useful.
6. c7d8: Retreats, not useful.

**Best plan:** Advance the pawn. But it's White's move after this, so let's see if we can make progress.

But currently, it's Black to move, and the pawn can't move (blocked by b5). So, the best move is to bring the king to b7 to support b6-b5 push in the future.

But c7b7 is legal and keeps the king close to the pawn, supporting its advance and preventing White's king from approaching.

**Calculation:**
- If c7b7, White can't make progress. If White plays Ka5, then Black can play bxa5, and the pawn is free to run.
- If White plays Kb4, then Black can play Kc7, keeping the opposition.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c7b7
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

- Black: King on b7, pawn on b6
- White: King on a3, pawn on b5

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Equal pawns, but Black's pawn is closer to promotion and supported by the king. White's king is cut off from the b-file, and White's pawn is blockaded by Black's pawn.

**Short-term tactics:** 
- Black can keep the king on the b-file to support the b6 pawn and prevent White's king from approaching.
- Advancing the b-pawn is not possible for either side at the moment.
- Black should avoid stalemate and keep zugzwang ideas in mind.

**Long-term strategy:** 
- Black can try to bring the king to c5, then play b5-b4, and promote the pawn.
- The king should not move away from the b-file, or White's king will invade.

**Candidate moves:**
1. b7c8: King to c8, but this allows White's king to approach via b4.
2. b7b8: King to b8, keeps the king on the b-file, but doesn't make progress.
3. b7a8: King to a8, but this is passive and could lead to stalemate if not careful.
4. b7c7: King to c7, keeps the king close to the pawn and prepares to go to c5.
5. b7a7: King to a7, but this is passive and could lead to stalemate.

**Best move:** 
- b7c7 is the most active, keeping the king close to the pawn and preparing to go to c5, which is the key square to support b5-b4 in the future.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b7c7
```

2025-06-22 11:46:27,857 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.76s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

- Black: King on c7, pawn on b6
- White: King on a2, pawn on b5

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Even, both sides have a pawn, but Black's pawn is one rank ahead and White's king is cut off.

**Key considerations:**
- Black's king is ideally placed to support the b-pawn.
- White's king is far from the action and cannot stop the b-pawn.
- The only way for White to draw is to sacrifice the pawn and get in front of Black's pawn, but the king is too far.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c7d6: Centralizes the king, but doesn't help push the pawn.
2. c7d7: Stays with the pawn, but doesn't make progress.
3. c7b8: Retreats, not useful.
4. c7c8: Retreats, not useful.
5. c7b7: Stays, not useful.
6. c7d8: Retreats, not useful.

**Best move:** The most direct plan is to push the pawn, but it's White's move after any king move, so let's see if we can make progress.

But wait: None of the legal moves are pawn pushes, only king moves. Let's check if moving the king to d6 is best, as it keeps the king close to the pawn and prepares to support b5-b4 if needed.

But let's check if White can do anything after c7d6:
- If White plays Ka3, then Black can play Kc5, and the pawn will queen.
- If White plays Kb3, then Black can play Kd5, and again, the pawn will queen.

So, the best move is to centralize the king and make progress.

**Final move:**
```
c7d6
```

2025-06-22 11:46:32,256 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 3.86s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on d6, pawn on b6
- White: King on a1, pawn on b5

It's Black to move.

**Immediate considerations:**
- Black is up a pawn (b6 vs b5).
- White's king is far from the action (a1).
- Black's king is centralized and can support the b6 pawn.
- White's pawn is blockaded by Black's b6 pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d6e7: King steps away from the b6 pawn, but White can't attack it immediately.
2. d6d7: King stays close to b6, but doesn't make progress.
3. d6c7: King moves closer to the queenside, supporting b6 and possibly attacking b5.
4. d6e6: King steps away from the queenside.
5. d6e5: King steps away from the queenside.
6. d6d5: King steps away from the queenside.
7. d6c5: King moves toward b5, attacking White's pawn.

**Best plan:**
- The main idea is to attack and capture the b5 pawn, then promote the b6 pawn.
- Moving the king to c5 attacks the b5 pawn directly.

**Check for opposition:**
- White's king is too far to help.
- After d6c5, White cannot defend the b5 pawn.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to play d6c5, attacking the b5 pawn and preparing to win it.

Final move:
```
d6c5
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

- Black: King on c5, pawn on b6
- White: King on b1

It's Black to move. The pawn is on b6, and the Black king is on c5. The White king is on b1, far from the action. The goal is to promote the b-pawn safely.

Candidate moves:
1. c5d4: King advances, but doesn't support the pawn directly.
2. c5c4: King stays on the c-file, but doesn't help the pawn.
3. c5d5: King moves away from the pawn.
4. c5b5: King moves closer to the pawn, supporting its advance.
5. c5d6: King moves away from the pawn.
6. c5b4: King moves to b4, directly supporting the pawn's advance to b5 and then b4.

Best move:
- c5b4 is the most direct and supports the pawn's advance. After b4, the pawn can march to b3, b2, and promote, as the White king is too far to stop it.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c5b4
```

2025-06-22 11:46:42,140 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.50s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on b4, pawn on b6
- White: King on c1, pawn on b5

It's Black to move. The kings are close to the pawns. Black's b6 pawn is one step from promotion, but White's king is near enough to try to stop it. White's b5 pawn is blockaded by Black's king.

Let's look at the candidate moves:

1. **b4c5**: King moves away from the pawn, allowing White to play bxa6, which is dangerous.
2. **b4b5**: Illegal (occupied by White pawn).
3. **b4a5**: King moves away from the pawn, similar issue as above.
4. **b4c4**: King moves toward White king, but doesn't help promote the pawn.
5. **b4a4**: King moves away from pawn, not helpful.
6. **b4c3**: King moves away from pawn, not helpful.
7. **b4b3**: King moves away from pawn, not helpful.
8. **b4a3**: King moves away from pawn, not helpful.

The only move that keeps the pawn protected and makes progress is **b4c4**. This keeps the king close to both pawns and supports the advance of the b-pawn.

Let's check what happens after **b4c4**:

- If White plays Kc2, Black can play b5-b4, and the pawn is unstoppable.
- If White plays Kb2, Black can play b5-b4, and again, the pawn is unstoppable.
- If White plays Kd2, Black can play b5-b4, and the pawn is unstoppable.

But let's check if White can try to capture the pawn with Kb2 and Kc3. After **b4c4**, White's king cannot reach the b6 pawn in time.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b4c4
```

Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on c4, pawn on b6.
- White: King on d1, pawn on b5.

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Equal pawns, but Black's pawn is more advanced and White's king is far from the action.

**Key ideas:**
- Black's king is well-placed to support the b-pawn.
- White's king is too far to stop the pawn.
- Black can push the pawn or improve the king's position.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c4xb5**: Captures White's pawn, leaving Black with a clear path to promote.
2. **c4c5**: Supports pawn push, but White can try to approach.
3. **b6b5**: Pushes pawn, but White can capture with b5xb6.
4. **Other king moves**: Don't seem to improve Black's position as much as capturing the pawn.

**Calculation:**
- If 1. ... c4b5, White has no pawns left, and Black's b-pawn will promote easily.
- White's king is too far to stop the pawn.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the b5 pawn.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

- Black: King on b5, pawn on b6
- White: King on e1
- It's Black to move.

Objective: Convert the pawn advantage. The White king is far away, so Black should aim to promote the pawn safely.

Candidate moves:
1. b5c6: King moves toward the center, supporting the pawn's advance.
2. b5a6: King moves away from the pawn, not optimal.
3. b5c5: King stays close to the pawn, but doesn't make progress.
4. b5a5: King moves away from the pawn, not optimal.
5. b5c4: King advances toward the center, but leaves the pawn unprotected.
6. b5b4: King steps back, not optimal.
7. b5a4: King moves away from the pawn, not optimal.

Best move:
- b5c6 keeps the king in front of the pawn, allowing for b6-b5-b4-b3-b2-b1=Q, with the king shepherding the pawn forward. The White king is too far to interfere.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b5c6

Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on c6, pawn on b6
- White: King on e2

It's Black to move. The goal is to convert the extra pawn into a win. The White king is far from the action, so Black should advance the pawn carefully, keeping the king close to support promotion and avoid stalemate tricks.

Let's consider the candidate moves:

1. **c6d7**: King moves toward supporting the pawn's advance. This is a standard technique in king and pawn endgames.
2. **c6c7**: King moves in front of the pawn, but this blocks the pawn's advance and is not ideal.
3. **c6b7**: King moves to b7, supporting the pawn, but not as active as d7.
4. **c6d6**: King moves away from the pawn, not optimal.
5. **c6d5**: King moves away from the pawn, not optimal.
6. **c6c5**: King moves away from the pawn, not optimal.
7. **c6b5**: King moves to b5, staying near the pawn, but not as active as d7.
8. **b6b5**: Pawn advances, but without king support, White's king could approach and try to draw.

The best move is to bring the king in front of the pawn to support its advance. The most active and winning plan is to play:

```
c6d7

2025-06-22 11:46:57,383 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 2.84s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

- Black: King on d7, pawn on b6
- White: King on e3

It's Black to move. The pawn is on b6, and the Black king is on d7. The White king is on e3, far from the pawn. The goal is to promote the pawn safely.

Candidate moves:
1. b6b5: Advance the pawn. White's king is too far to stop it.
2. King moves: d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7e7, d7c7, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6. But these do not help as much as pushing the pawn.

If Black plays b6b5, the pawn will continue to b4, b3, b2, b1=Q. The White king is too far to stop the pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b6b5
```

Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on d7, pawn on b5
- White: King on f4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black is up a pawn.
**Position:** The Black king is central and can support the b-pawn. The White king is far from the queenside and cannot immediately stop the pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5b4**: Pushes the pawn, aiming to create a passed pawn. The White king is too far to stop it immediately.
2. **d7c6**: Move the king closer to support the pawn, but b4 is more direct.
3. **d7e6**: Move the king toward the center, but less relevant than pushing the pawn.
4. **d7c8, d7d8, d7e8, d7e7, d7c7, d7d6**: King moves, but none are as urgent as pushing the pawn.

**Calculation after b5b4:**
- If White tries to run toward the pawn (Ke4-d4-c4), Black can push b3 and the king can support the pawn's promotion.
- The White king is too far to stop the pawn in time.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to push the pawn immediately.

2025-06-22 11:47:08,676 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.07s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on d7, pawn on b4
- White: King on e4

It's Black to move. The pawn on b4 is advanced, and the White king is close enough to try to stop it. The Black king is on d7, which is well placed to support the pawn's advance or block the White king.

Let's consider the candidate moves:

1. **b4-b3**: Advance the pawn. White can play Kd3, getting closer to the pawn. After b2, Kc2, and the king is in front of the pawn, which is not ideal for Black.
2. **King moves**: 
   - d7-e8: King moves away from the pawn, not ideal.
   - d7-d8: King moves to the back rank, not ideal.
   - d7-c8: King moves away from the pawn, not ideal.
   - d7-e7: King stays near the pawn, but doesn't make progress.
   - d7-c7: King stays near the pawn, but doesn't make progress.
   - d7-e6: King moves toward the White king, but White can approach the pawn.
   - d7-d6: King moves toward the White king, but White can approach the pawn.
   - d7-c6: King moves toward the pawn, but White can approach the pawn.

The key is to keep the White king cut off from the pawn's path and support the pawn's advance.

If we play **d7-d6**, White can play Kd4, then after b3, Kc3, and White is in time to stop the pawn.

If we play **d7-c7**, White can play Kd4, then after b3, Kc4, and again White is in time.

If we play **d7-e6**, White can play Kd4, then after b3, Kc4, and again White is in time.

If we play **d7-e7**, White can play Kd4, then after b3, Kc4, and again White is in time.

If we play **b4-b3**, White can play Kd3, then after b2, Kc2, and White is in front of the pawn.

If we play **d7-d8**, White can play Kd4, then after b3, Kc4, and again White is in time.

If we play **d7-e8**, White can play Kd4, then after b3, Kc4, and again White is in time.

If we play **d7-c8**, White can play Kd4, then after b3, Kc4, and again White is in time.

If we play **d7-c6**, White can play Kd4, then after b3, Kc4, and again White is in time.

It appears that no matter what, White can get in front of the pawn and the game is likely a draw with best play.

However, the most pressing move is to advance the pawn and force White to respond.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b4b3

2025-06-22 11:47:22,362 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 13.00s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on d7, pawn on b3
- White: King on d3

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black is up a pawn (b3).  
**King positions:** Black's king is on d7, White's king is on d3.  
**Pawn:** Black's b3 pawn is two squares from promotion.  
**White's king:** The white king is close to the b3 pawn, but not directly in front of it.

**Legal moves:**
- d7e8 (King to e8)
- d7d8 (King to d8)
- d7c8 (King to c8)
- d7e7 (King to e7)
- d7c7 (King to c7)
- d7e6 (King to e6)
- d7d6 (King to d6)
- d7c6 (King to c6)
- b3b2 (Pawn to b2)

**Candidate moves:**
- b3b2: Pushes the pawn, threatening to promote next move. White's king is on d3, so after b3b2, if White plays Kc2, then b1=Q is possible, but White can capture the queen after Kxb1. However, after b3b2, if White plays Kc3, then b1=Q is not possible because White can take on b2.
- King moves: Moving the king to support the pawn's promotion.

**Critical analysis:**
If I play b3b2:
- White can play Kc2, attacking the pawn.
- After Kc2, if I play b1=Q, White plays Kxb1 and the pawn is gone.
- If I play any king move, White will take the pawn next move.

If I play Kc6:
- White can play Kc3, approaching the pawn.
- If I play Kb5, White plays Kxb3 and the pawn is lost.

If I play Ke6:
- White can play Kc3, and again, the pawn is lost.

If I play Kd6:
- White can play Kc3, and again, the pawn is lost.

If I play Kc8:
- White can play Kc3, and again, the pawn is lost.

If I play Kd8:
- White can play Kc3, and again, the pawn is lost.

If I play Ke7:
- White can play Kc3, and again, the pawn is lost.

If I play Kc7:
- White can play Kc3, and again, the pawn is lost.

If I play Ke8:
- White can play Kc3, and again, the pawn is lost.

So, let's try to see if there is a way to shield the pawn from the white king.

If I play Kc6:
- White plays Kc3.
- I play Kb5.
- White plays Kxb3.

No, the pawn is lost.

If I play Kd6:
- White plays Kc3.
- I play Kc5.
- White plays Kxb3.

No, the pawn is lost.

If I play Ke6:
- White plays Kc3.
- I play Kd5.
- White plays Kxb3.

No, the pawn is lost.

If I play b3b2:
- White plays Kc2.
- If I play Kc6, White plays Kxb2.

No, the pawn is lost.

Is there a way to shield the pawn? Let's try to triangulate with the king.

2025-06-22 11:47:27,968 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 3.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black has a king on d7 and a pawn on b2.
- White has a king on e4.
- The pawn on b2 is one step from promotion.
- White's king is too far to stop the pawn from promoting.
- Black can promote the pawn immediately.

Candidate moves:
1. Promote the pawn to a queen: b2b1q
2. Promote the pawn to a rook: b2b1r
3. Promote the pawn to a bishop: b2b1b
4. Promote the pawn to a knight: b2b1n
5. Move the king: d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7e7, d7c7, d7e6, d7d6, d7c6

Promoting to a queen is the most logical and direct way to win. White's king is too far to create any counterplay. Promoting to a rook, bishop, or knight is unnecessary and only risks stalemate if not careful.

Check for stalemate:
- After b2b1q, White's king on e4 has legal moves (d5, f5, d3, f3, etc.), so no stalemate.

Therefore, the best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

b2b1q

2025-06-22 11:47:33,078 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.16s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on d7, Queen on b1
- White: King on d4

It's Black to move. White's king is exposed in the center, and Black's queen is very active. The goal is to checkmate or force a decisive material advantage.

Let's look for forced mates or ways to restrict the White king.

Candidate moves:
1. b1e4+ — Queen check, forcing the king to move.
2. b1b4+ — Queen check, but the king can escape to c5 or d5.
3. b1d3+ — Queen check, king can go to e5 or c5.
4. b1b2 — Not a check, but keeps queen active.

Let's calculate b1e4+:
- If 1...Qe4+, White must move the king:
    - 2. Kc5 (only move, as e5 is covered by queen, c3 is covered by queen, d5 is covered by queen)
    - Now, Black can play ...Qc6+ and force the king further.

Let's check if this is a forced mate:
1...Qe4+
2. Kc5 Qc6+
3. Kd4 (only move)
3...Qd5+ (forces king to c3)
4. Kc3 Qd4+ (forces king to b3)
5. Kb3 Qb4#

This is a forced mate in 5.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b1e4
```
