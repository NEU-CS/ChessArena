2025-06-21 23:29:37,202 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.56s):
Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of chess. As White, I have the first move and a wide range of opening choices. The best opening moves aim to control the center, develop pieces, and prepare for king safety (castling).

Candidate moves:
- e2e4: Opens lines for the queen and bishop, controls the center.
- d2d4: Also controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.
- c2c4: English Opening, controls d5 and prepares for a flexible pawn structure.
- g1f3: Develops a knight, controls e5 and d4.
- b1c3: Develops a knight, controls d5 and e4.

Among these, e2e4 and d2d4 are the most popular and theoretically sound. e2e4 is slightly more aggressive and leads to open games, while d2d4 can lead to more closed positions.

Given the need for a critically urgent and ambitious approach, I will play the most aggressive and classical move:

```
e2e4
```

Let's analyze the position:

1. e4 d6

This is the start of a Pirc Defense. As White, we want to occupy the center and develop pieces efficiently. The most principled move is to play d4, grabbing more central space and opening lines for both the queen and the light-squared bishop.

Candidate moves:
- d2d4: Occupies the center, classical main line.
- b1c3: Develops a knight, but d4 is more direct.
- f1c4 or f1b5: Developing bishop, but center control first is better.
- c2c4: Queen's Gambit style, but less direct than d4.

No tactical threats from Black yet. The best move is to play d4.

Final move:
```
d2d4
```

2025-06-21 23:31:15,239 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.16s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White has a strong center with pawns on d4 and e4.
- Black has played ...a5 and ...d6, which is a bit unusual. The ...a5 move weakens b5 and leaves the queenside slightly vulnerable.
- All minor pieces are still on their original squares.
- White can develop pieces, support the center, or push in the center.

Candidate moves:
1. **Nf3**: Develops a knight, supports e4 and d4, and prepares to castle.
2. **Nc3**: Develops a knight, supports d4 and e4, and eyes b5 and d5.
3. **Bc4/Bb5**: Develops a bishop, possibly pinning or pressuring Black's queenside.
4. **d5**: Pushes in the center, gaining space and possibly cramping Black.
5. **e5**: Pushes in the center, but Black can respond with ...dxe5.
6. **a4**: Challenges Black's a5 pawn, but not urgent.
7. **c4**: Supports the center and prepares for queenside expansion.

Of these, **Nc3** is the most natural, developing a piece, supporting the center, and keeping options open. **Nf3** is also good, but Nc3 directly challenges Black's queenside play and supports a future e5 or d5 push.

After careful consideration, the best move is:

```
b1c3

2025-06-21 23:32:45,980 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.06s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1.e4 d6 2.d4 a5 3.Nc3 g5**

- Black has played some unorthodox moves: ...a5 and ...g5, weakening both flanks.
- White has a strong center and rapid development potential.
- Black's king is still in the center and kingside is weakened by ...g5.
- White can consider immediate central action (e5, d5), development (Nf3, Bc4, etc.), or even direct attacks (Qh5, Bxg5 ideas).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4-d5**: Gains space, attacks the knight, and opens the center while Black is underdeveloped.
2. **e4-e5**: Pushes in the center, attacks the knight, but doesn't open lines as much as d5.
3. **Nf3**: Develops, but less ambitious than central breaks.
4. **Qh5**: Directly targets the g5 pawn and h7, but Black can defend with ...Nf6.
5. **Bc4**: Develops and eyes f7, but not immediately threatening.
6. **h4**: Tries to undermine Black's kingside, but Black can respond with ...g4.

**Deep analysis:**

- **d5**: If ...Nf6, then Bxg5 is possible, exploiting the pin on the knight. If ...Bg7, White can continue with Nf3 and e5 ideas. Also, ...h6 can be met by h4, opening the kingside.
- **e5**: If ...dxe5, then dxe5 Qxd1+ Kxd1, White has a lead in development. If ...Nc6, then exd6 Qxd6, White is still ahead in development.
- **Qh5**: ...Nf6, Qxg5 Rg8, Qh4 Rg4, White's queen is awkward.

**Conclusion:**
- **d5** is the most principled, opening the center while Black is underdeveloped and has weakened kingside squares.

2025-06-21 23:34:09,765 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.11s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black has played an aggressive kingside pawn push (g5) and moved the knight to h6, which is awkward and blocks kingside castling.
- White has a strong center with pawns on e4 and d5.
- Black's queenside is underdeveloped, and the king is still in the center.
- The move d5-d6 is not possible yet, but White can increase pressure or develop pieces.

Candidate moves:
1. **Bishop development:** Bc1xg5, Bc1-e3, Bc1-f4, Bc1-d2. Bg5 is interesting, pinning the knight and threatening to take on g5.
2. **Queen moves:** Qd1-h5 threatens mate on h7, but Black can defend with Bg7 or Nf7.
3. **e4-e5:** Kicks the knight, but after dxe5, White can recapture with the queen or knight.
4. **h2-h4:** Undermines Black's kingside pawn structure.
5. **Nf3:** Develops a piece, controls e5 and h4.
6. **a2-a4:** Undermines Black's queenside, but less urgent.

Let's look at the most forcing moves:

- **Qh5:** Threatens mate, but after Bg7, White doesn't have a direct follow-up.
- **h4:** If gxh4, Qxh5 is very strong, threatening mate and attacking the knight on h6.
- **Nf3:** Solid development, but not as forcing as h4 or Qh5.

Let's calculate **h4**:
1. h4 gxh4
2. Qh5 (threatening Bxh6 and Qxh6#)
   - If Bg7, Bxh6 Bxh6 Qxh6, White is up material and attacking.
   - If Ng4, Qxh4, White is better.

If Black doesn't take:
1. h4 g4
2. Bxh6 Bxh6
3. Qxh6, White is threatening Qxh7#.

**h4** is a strong attacking move, opening the h-file and threatening to break through on the kingside.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h2h4
```

2025-06-21 23:35:18,923 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.36s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:** Equal.
**King safety:** Both kings are uncastled, but Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside anymore (rook moved to g8). White's king is safer for now.
**Development:** White is ahead. All minor pieces are out or ready to be developed. Black's queenside is undeveloped.
**Pawn structure:** White has a strong center and space advantage. Black's kingside is weakened (g5, h6, rook on g8).

**Tactical ideas:**
- The move h4-h5 is strong, threatening to open the h-file and attack Black's king.
- The move hxg5 is also tempting, opening the h-file and possibly targeting the knight on h6.
- The move dxc6 is not possible (no pawn on c6).
- Developing pieces with tempo (Bf4, Bg5, etc.) is possible.
- Qh5 is a candidate, threatening Qxh6 and putting pressure on Black's kingside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h4h5: Directly attacks the knight on h6, threatens to open the h-file.
2. hxg5: Opens the h-file, attacks the knight, and threatens Qh5.
3. Qh5: Immediate pressure on h6, but Black can defend with ...Rg6 or ...Bg7.
4. Bxg5: Not possible, pawn on g5.
5. Nf3: Develops, but less urgent than attacking.
6. Bf4: Develops, but less urgent.

**Calculating h4h5:**
- h4h5, g5g4 (if Black tries to close), Bxh6, Bxh6, Qxh6, Ng4 (only defense), Qxh7, Nf6, Qh4, gxh4, Rxh4, White is winning.
- h4h5, gxh4, Rxh4, gxh4, Qxh5, White is threatening mate on h7.

**Calculating hxg5:**
- hxg5, Rxg5 (if Black recaptures), Nf3, Rg6, Nh4, Rg8, Qh5, White is attacking.
- hxg5, Ng4, Qxg4, Bxg4, f3, Bd7, fxg4, White is up a piece.

**Calculating Qh5:**
- Qh5, Rg6, hxg5, Ng4, Qxg6, fxg6, Rxh6, Nxh6, Bxg5, White is better.

**Best move:**
h4h5 is the most direct, opening lines and threatening to win material or attack the king. Black's kingside is weak, and this move keeps the initiative.

My move:
```
h4h5

2025-06-21 23:37:15,153 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.64s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 6...Qd7:**
- Black's king is still in the center (e8), unable to castle kingside due to the rook on g8 and the h6 knight blocking f7.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped (b8 knight, c8 bishop).
- White has a strong pawn on d5, cramping Black.
- Black's kingside is weakened by ...g5 and ...h6.
- White's h5 pawn is advanced, threatening to open the h-file.
- White's pieces are ready to develop rapidly.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bb5** (f1b5): Pins the knight on c6 to the king, threatens to win material, and increases pressure.
2. **Nf3** (g1f3): Develops a piece, prepares to castle, and eyes the g5 pawn.
3. **Be3** (c1e3): Develops, supports d5, and eyes the kingside.
4. **Qd4** (d1d4): Centralizes the queen, threatens to invade on the kingside, but could be premature.
5. **g4** (g2g4): Aggressive, but could weaken White's own king.
6. **a4** (a2a4): Tries to open the a-file, but less relevant now.

**Deep analysis:**
- **Bb5** is the most forcing. If ...Bg7, then dxc6 wins a piece (the knight on h6 is loose). If ...Ra6, White can continue development with Nf3 or Qd3.
- **Nf3** is solid, but less forcing.
- **Be3** is solid, but not as aggressive as Bb5.
- **Qd4** is interesting, but the queen could be vulnerable.
- **g4** is too weakening.

**Calculation after 7.Bb5:**
- 7.Bb5 pins the knight.
- If 7...Bg7, then 8.dxc6 bxc6 9.Bxg5 (threatening to win the h6 knight).
- If 7...c6, then dxc6 bxc6, and the pin remains.
- If 7...Ra6, White can continue with Nf3.

**Conclusion:**
The move **Bb5** is the most aggressive, increases pressure, and could win material.

My move:

2025-06-21 23:38:39,724 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.30s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- White to move.
- Black's king is on e8, unable to castle (rook on h8 has moved).
- Black's queen is on d7, knight on h6, bishop and rook undeveloped.
- White has a bishop on b5 pinning the knight on c6, knight on c3, pawns on e4, d5, h5, etc.
- Black's last move was ...c5, attacking d4 and opening the c-file.
- White's bishop on b5 is very active, and Black's king is stuck in the center.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- The move b5xc6+ (b5c6) is a check, and if bxc6, then dxc6 wins a piece (the queen on d7 is hanging after the exchange).
- b5xd7+ (b5d7) is also a check, but after Qxd7, White loses the bishop for a queen trade, which is not optimal.
- d5xc6 (d5c6) is possible, but after bxc6, White hasn't gained much.
- e4e5 attacks the knight on h6, but Black can play dxe5 or Nxe5.

**Best Candidate Move:**
- b5xc6+ (b5c6) is the most forcing move. Let's calculate:
    1. b5c6+ bxc6 (forced)
    2. dxc6 Qxc6 (if Qxc6, then Bxg5, but let's see)
    3. Bxg5 Rxg5 (if Black takes back)
    4. Nf3, White is up a pawn and has a strong initiative.

But let's check if b5c6+ wins more:
- b5c6+ bxc6
- dxc6 Qxc6
- Bxg5 Rxg5
- Nf3 Rxg2
- Qd5 Qxd5
- Nxd5

Alternatively, after b5c6+ bxc6, dxc6 Qxc6, White can play Qd5, threatening c7 and g5.

**Alternative:**
- d5xc6 is less forcing.
- e4e5 is not as strong.

**Conclusion:**
b5c6+ is the most forcing and best move, opening the center and exploiting Black's king in the center.

My move:
```
b5c6

- Black's king is on e8, hasn't castled, and is in the center.

**Tactical Features:**
- White's bishop on c6 is attacking d7 (queen and rook).
- Black's knight on h6 is awkward.
- White's h5 pawn is advanced, threatening h5xg6.
- Black's g6 rook is on an open file, but not active yet.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **c6d7**: Bishop takes queen, winning material.
2. c6b7: Bishop attacks rook, but not as strong as c6d7.
3. h5g6: Pawn takes on g6, but Black can recapture.
4. d1d2: Prepares to castle queenside, but not urgent.
5. d1g4: Attacks g6 rook, but not as strong as c6d7.

**Calculation:**
- After **c6d7+**, Black must recapture with the knight or bishop (since the queen is taken).
- White wins the queen for a bishop, a decisive material advantage.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the queen with the bishop.

2025-06-21 23:40:12,695 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.15s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 10...Kd7:**
- Black's king is on d7, somewhat exposed.
- Black's bishop is on f8, knight on h6, rook on h6, and pawns are advanced on the queenside.
- White has a knight on c3, pawns on e4, d5, h5, and a rook on h1.
- White's queen and bishop are on their original squares, but the center is open and Black's king is vulnerable.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The move h5-h6 is possible, but Black can respond with ...Ng4 or ...Rxh6.
- The move Qg4 targets the g5 pawn and the knight on h6, but it's not currently possible in one move.
- The move Bxg5 is not possible.
- The move e4-e5 attacks the pinned knight on h6 and opens the e-file, but Black can respond with ...dxe5.
- The move Nf3 develops a piece and eyes e5 and g5.
- The move Qd2 prepares to castle queenside, bringing the rook to d1 and increasing pressure on the d-file.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Nf3 – Develops a piece, eyes e5 and g5, prepares to castle.
2. Qd2 – Prepares long castle, brings rook to d1.
3. h5xg6 – Opens the h-file, but after ...hxg6, Black's rook is active.
4. e4-e5 – Opens the center, but after ...dxe5, the position is unclear.
5. g4 – Prepares g5, but weakens kingside.

**Deep analysis:**
- Nf3 is solid, develops, and keeps options open.
- Qd2 is also good, but Nf3 is more flexible.
- e4-e5 is tempting, but after ...dxe5, White doesn't have a clear follow-up.
- h5xg6 opens the h-file, but Black's rook becomes active.

**Best move:**
Nf3 is the most flexible, develops a piece, and keeps all options open. It also prepares to castle and supports the center.

Final move:
```
g1f3

2025-06-21 23:41:04,385 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.17s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns
- Black: 2 Rooks, Bishop, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns

**King Safety:**
- White's king is on e1, can castle kingside.
- Black's king is on d7, cannot castle, and is somewhat exposed.

**Piece Activity:**
- White's knights are centralized and have good scope.
- White's queen and rooks are undeveloped but can be activated quickly.
- Black's pieces are somewhat cramped, and the king is vulnerable.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- The move h5-h6 is possible, but Black's knight on g6 covers h8.
- The move Nxg5 threatens to bring more pieces into the attack.
- Castling kingside (O-O) would bring the rook to f1, eyeing the f-file and connecting the rooks.
- The move e4-e5 opens the center, but Black's king is already exposed.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. O-O (castling kingside): Brings the rook to f1, improves king safety, and prepares for central or kingside action.
2. Nxg5: Brings another piece into the attack, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.
3. e4-e5: Opens the center, but Black's pieces are ready to contest.
4. h5xg6: Opens the h-file, but Black can recapture with the knight.
5. Qd1d4: Centralizes the queen, threatens to invade d7 or g7.
6. Nf3e5: Centralizes the knight, attacks g6, and threatens to jump to c4 or f7.

**Deeper Analysis:**
- Castling is safe and brings the rook to f1, which could be decisive given Black's exposed king.
- e4-e5 is tempting, but after dxe5, Nxe5+ Nxe5, Nxe5+ Kd6, Black's king can run to c7.
- Qd1d4 is strong, threatening both g7 and d7, and if Black plays cxd4, Nxd4 attacks the c6 knight and threatens to bring more pieces into the attack.

**Best Move:**
Castling kingside (O-O) is the most prudent, as it brings the rook into play, connects the rooks, and keeps the king safe. It also prepares for a rook lift or a central break with e4-e5.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e1g1

2025-06-21 23:42:30,575 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.49s):
Let's analyze the position step by step:

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, Bishop, Knight, 6 Pawns

**King safety:**
- White's king is castled and relatively safe.
- Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed, and the queenside pawns are advanced, making it more vulnerable.

**Piece activity:**
- White's knights are centralized and can jump into strong squares.
- Black's pieces are somewhat cramped, especially the bishop on f8 and rook on h6.

**Immediate threats:**
- White's knight on f3 can jump to g5, threatening to invade e6 or f7.
- The pawn on h5 can be pushed to h6, opening lines against Black's king.
- The queen and rook can quickly join the attack via d2 or d4.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h5-h6**: Opens the h-file, threatens to open lines against Black's king, but Black can respond with ...Rhxh6.
2. **Nf3-g5**: Threatens Ne6+ and puts pressure on f7 and h7. If Black plays ...Ne5, White can play f4.
3. **Nc3-b5+**: Immediate check, but Black can play ...Kb6 or ...Kd8.
4. **e4-e5**: Opens the center, but Black can play ...Nxe5 or ...dxe5.
5. **Qd1-d4**: Centralizes the queen, threatens Qxa4, but doesn't create an immediate threat.

**Deep calculation:**
- **Nf3-g5**: If ...Ne5, then f4, and if ...gxf4, Bxf4, White's attack grows. If ...Nf4, then Bxf4, gxf4, Qg4, White gets strong kingside play.
- **Nc3-b5+**: If ...Kb6, then c4, trapping the king. If ...Kd8, then Qd2, threatening Qxg5.
- **h5-h6**: If ...Rhxh6, then Bxg5, and White's attack is strong.

**Best move:**
After careful analysis, **Nc3-b5+** looks very strong. It forces Black's king to b6 or d8. If ...Kb6, then c4 traps the king. If ...Kd8, then Qd2 threatens Qxg5 and Qxa4. This move exploits Black's exposed king and could lead to a quick win.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c3b5
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 6 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, Knight, 6 Pawns

**Position:**
- White has a knight on b5, which is very active and attacks d6 and c7.
- Black's king is on d7, somewhat exposed.
- Black's knight is on h6, not very active.
- Black's bishop on f8 is undeveloped.
- White's pieces are more active, especially the knight on b5 and the queen on d1.
- White has a potential for a kingside attack, and Black's king is not safe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5c7**: Knight fork, attacking the king and rook.
2. **b5d4**: Centralizing the knight, but less forcing.
3. **f3g5**: Threatening Ne6+ and opening lines.
4. **c1g5**: Developing bishop, but less forcing.
5. **e4e5**: Opening the center, but Black's king is already exposed.

**Calculation:**
- **b5c7**: After this, Black must respond with Kxc7, then White can continue development or attack.
- **b5d6**: Check, but Black can play exd6.
- **b5a7**: Attacks the rook, but less forcing than c7.
- **b5c7** is a fork, winning material.

**Best move:**
- **b5c7** wins the exchange (rook for knight) and keeps up the initiative.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b5c7
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns

**King safety:**
- White's king is castled and relatively safe.
- Black's king is still in the center (d7), which is dangerous.

**Piece activity:**
- White's knight on c7 is deep in enemy territory, attacking a8 and e6.
- White's other knight is on f3, ready to jump.
- White's rooks are ready to come to open files.
- Black's pieces are somewhat cramped, and the king is exposed.

**Tactical considerations:**
- The knight on c7 can fork the king and rook with c7xa8, but after Rxa8, White loses the knight.
- c7e6 is a check, but after fxe6, White loses the knight.
- c7e8 is a check, forcing the king to move, but after Kxe8, White loses the knight.
- d5xe6 is a pawn capture, but Black can recapture with f7xe6.
- h5xg6 is a pawn capture, but Black can recapture with h7xg6.

**Strategic considerations:**
- Black's king is in the center and vulnerable.
- White should try to open lines and attack the king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c7e6+ (knight check): fxe6, loses the knight.
2. c7e8+ (knight check): Kxe8, loses the knight.
3. d5e6 (pawn capture): fxe6, opens the f-file.
4. f3g5 (knight move): threatens Nxf7, but not immediately dangerous.
5. c1g5 (bishop development): threatens to bring more pieces into the attack.
6. d1d3 (queen lift): prepares to swing the queen to attack.
7. d1e2 (queen move): prepares to attack the king.

**Deep calculation:**
- Let's look at c7e6+:
    - c7e6+ fxe6 (forced)
    - d5e6+ Kxe6 (forced)
    - Nxg5+ (if f3g5 was played earlier, but not possible now)
    - White has lost a knight and a pawn for two pawns, but the Black king is exposed.

- Let's look at c1g5:
    - c1g5 Be7 (defending)
    - Bxe7 Nxe7
    - Nxa8 Rxa8
    - White wins the exchange.

- Let's look at d1d3:
    - d1d3 Be7
    - Nxa8 Rxa8
    - White wins the exchange.

- Let's look at c7a8:
    - c7a8 Rxa8
    - White wins the exchange.

But after c7a8, Black's king is still in the center, and White can continue to attack.

**Best move:**
- c7a8 wins the exchange (rook for knight) and keeps the initiative, as Black's king is still exposed.
- c1g5 develops a piece and threatens to win the exchange, but c7a8 does it immediately.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c7a8
```

2025-06-21 23:44:59,195 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.65s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 14... Ng8:**
- White: King on g1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c1, Knight on f3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, e4, f2, g2, h5.
- Black: King on d7, Queen is off the board, Rooks on g6, Bishop on b7, Knight on b8, pawns on a4, b7, c5, d6, e5, f7, g7, h8, Knight on g8.

**Material:**
- White is up a full rook (White has both rooks, Black has only one).
- Black's king is exposed on d7.
- Black's knight on b8 and bishop on b7 are awkwardly placed.
- Black's rook on g6 is active, but White's king is safe.
- White's h5 pawn is advanced and can be used for attack.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a8c7+ (Check with the knight, forking king and rook)
2. f3g5 (Bringing another piece into the attack)
3. d1d2 or d1e2 (Connecting rooks, preparing to double)
4. c1g5 (Developing bishop, attacking rook)
5. h5g6 (Pawn break, opening lines)
6. d1g4+ (Not possible, queen is on d1, but no direct check)
7. a8b6 (Knight attacks rook and bishop, but less forcing than a8c7+)

**Most forcing move:**
- a8c7+ is a check, and the king has to move. Let's see what happens after that.

**Calculation:**
1. a8c7+ Kxc7 (forced, as only legal move)
2. Nxg5 (threatening Ne6+ and Qg4, but let's see if there's something better)
   - Alternatively, Qg4+ is not possible yet.
   - After Kxc7, Black's king is on c7, still exposed.

But let's check if a8c7+ wins material:
- After a8c7+ Kxc7, White can play Nxg5, threatening Ne6+ fork.
- If Black tries to defend with Nf6, then Ne6+ forks king and rook.

Alternatively, after a8c7+, if Black plays Kd8, then Nxa8 wins the rook.

But after a8c7+, Kxc7 is forced.

So, a8c7+ is a forcing move that wins the exchange (rook for knight), and keeps up the attack.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is the forcing check:

```
a8c7
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 6 Pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 6 Pawns

**Position:**
- White's knight is on c7, deep in Black's territory, attacking the rook on a8 and the bishop on b8.
- Black's king is on d7, somewhat exposed.
- White's pieces are generally well-coordinated.
- Black's pieces are somewhat passive, and the king is vulnerable.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c7e8**: Knight takes rook with check. This is a forcing move, wins the exchange, and checks the king.
2. **c7a8**: Knight takes rook, but no check.
3. **c7e6**: Knight check, but doesn't win material.
4. **c7a6**: Knight check, but doesn't win material.
5. Other knight moves: Not as forcing or material-winning.
6. Other moves: Not as forcing as c7e8.

**Calculation for c7e8:**
- 16. Nc7xe8+ Kxe8 (forced)
- White is up the exchange (rook for knight).
- The Black king is still exposed, and White can continue to press.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to take the rook with check, maximizing material gain and keeping the initiative.

2025-06-21 23:46:40,436 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.45s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 6 pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns

**King Safety:**
- White's king is relatively safe, castled kingside.
- Black's king is on d7, exposed and vulnerable.

**Piece Activity:**
- White's pieces are very active. The knight on e8 is deep in enemy territory, and Black's king is stuck in the center.
- Black's pieces are cramped, and the king is exposed.

**Tactical Opportunities:**
- The knight on e8 attacks f6 and d6.
- The queen on d1 can swing to g4 or g5, potentially threatening mate.
- The rook on f1 can come to b1 or d1, pressuring the b7 pawn or the d-file.
- The move h5-h6 is possible, opening lines against Black's king.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **h5-h6**: Threatens to open the h-file and create mating threats.
2. **Nxf6+**: Immediate check, but after Bxf6, White loses a powerful knight.
3. **Qd2**: Threatens to swing the queen to a5 or g5.
4. **Nd6**: Knight check, but after Kxd6, White loses the knight.
5. **Nxg7**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.
6. **Qd3**: Threatens Qb5+ or Qh3.

**Deep Calculation:**
- **h5-h6**: If ...Rxh6, then Nxg7, and White is threatening Nf5, Qg4, and Qg5 with devastating effect. If ...g4, then Nh4, and White can bring the queen to g4.
- **Nxf6+**: Bxf6, now h5-h6 is less effective.
- **Nd6**: Kxd6, White loses the knight.
- **Qd3**: Prepares Qb5+ or Qh3, but not as forcing as h5-h6.

**Conclusion:**
The move **h5-h6** is the most promising. It opens lines, threatens to break open Black's king position, and keeps all attacking pieces on the board.

My move:
```
h5h6
```

2025-06-21 23:47:34,212 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.48s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1nb1Nb2/1p2kp1p/3p1nrP/2pPp1p1/4P3/p4N2/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 18

**White:** King on g1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on e8, Queen on d1, Knight on f3, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, e4, f2, g2, h6  
**Black:** King on e7, Rook on f6, Bishop on b8, Knight on b8, Pawns on a3, b7, c5, d6, e5, g5, h7

**Key features:**
- White's bishop on e8 is very strong, controlling g6 and f7.
- White's pawn on h6 is advanced and restricts Black's king.
- Black's king is exposed on e7.
- Black's rook on f6 and bishop/knight on b8 are somewhat passive.
- White's knight on f3 can jump to g5 or e5, both attacking squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxe5** (f3e5): Attacks the pinned rook on f6 and threatens Nc6+.
2. **Nxg5** (f3g5): Attacks h7 and threatens Qh5.
3. **Qd2** (d1d2): Prepares Qg5 or Qh5.
4. **Bishop moves:** The bishop is well-placed, no need to move.
5. **dxc6:** Not possible, pawn is on d5.
6. **Pawn moves:** Not urgent.

**Tactical calculation for Nxe5:**
- 18. Nxe5 dxe5 (if Black captures)
- 19. Bxg5 wins the rook on f6, but Black can try ...Nd7 or ...Kf7.
- If 18...Rxf1+ 19. Qxf1 Kxe8, White is up material and has a strong attack.

**Tactical calculation for Nxg5:**
- 18. Nxg5 Rxh6 (if Black captures h6)
- 19. Nxh7 Rxh7, White has lost the h-pawn, but can play Qh5.

**Tactical calculation for Qd2:**
- Prepares Qg5 or Qh5, but not as forcing as Nxe5.

**Tactical calculation for Nxe5:**
- 18. Nxe5 dxe5 (if Black captures)
- 19. Bxg5 wins the rook, and Black's king is exposed.

**Best move:** Nxe5 is the most forcing and wins material. It also opens up the position against Black's exposed king.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f3e5
```

2025-06-21 23:48:21,053 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.80s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Queen (d1), Bishop (e8), Knight (e5), pawns (a3, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h6), King (g1)
- Black: Rook (g6), Bishop (b8), Knight (e4), pawns (a3, b7, c5, d6, e7, f7, g5, h7), King (e7)

**Key features:**
- White's knight on e5 is very strong, centralized, and attacking.
- White's bishop on e8 is awkward but can be repositioned.
- Black's king is exposed on e7.
- Black's knight on e4 is strong but can be attacked.
- White's pawn on h6 is advanced and could be a threat.
- Black's rook on g6 is active, but not threatening immediate mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e5g6**: N(g6) attacks the rook on g6 and threatens to win material.
2. **e5f7**: Nf7+ is a check, but after Kxf7, White loses the knight.
3. **d1h5**: Qh5 threatens Qxh7+ and puts pressure on the kingside.
4. **d1g4**: Qg4 attacks the rook on g6 and threatens Qd7+.
5. **e8g7**: Be8-g7 attacks the rook on g6 and supports the h6 pawn.
6. **c1g5**: Bg5+ check, but Black can block with f6 or Nf6.
7. **e5c6**: Nc6+ check, but Black can play bxc6 or Kd7.

**Deep analysis:**

- **e5g6**: N(g6) attacks the rook, but Black can play Rxg6, hxg6, and then White has a passed pawn on g6, which is dangerous.
- **d1h5**: Qh5 threatens Qxh7+, but Black can play Nf6, defending h7.
- **d1g4**: Qg4 attacks the rook and threatens Qd7+, but Black can play Nf6, defending.
- **e8g7**: Be8-g7 attacks the rook, and if Rxg7, hxg7, White has a dangerous passed pawn on g7.

**Best move:**

After careful consideration, **e8g7** is the most promising. It attacks the rook, and if Black exchanges, White gets a dangerous passed pawn on g7, threatening to promote. If the rook moves, White can play Qh5, threatening Qxh7+ and Qf7#.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e8g7
```

2025-06-21 23:49:16,109 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.98s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (after 19...h6):**
- White: King on g1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and f1, Bishop on c1, Knight on g7 and e5, pawns on a3, b2, c2, d5, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e7, Queen is off the board, Rook on h6, Bishop on f8 and b8, Knight on e4, pawns on a3, b7, c5, d6, g5.

**Material:**
- White is up a full rook (Black is missing a rook, White has both).
- White also has a knight on g7 deep in Black's territory.
- Black's king is exposed on e7.

**Threats:**
- White's knight on e5 is strong, and the knight on g7 is menacing.
- Black's king is vulnerable.
- Black's rook on h6 is active, but not threatening immediate mate.
- Black's knight on e4 is centralized, but not attacking anything critical.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf5+** (e5f7): Knight check, forcing the king to move.
2. **Qh5** (d1h5): Threatens mate on e8, but Black can block with Nf6.
3. **Qd4** (d1d4): Centralizes queen, threatens mate on g7, but not immediate.
4. **Ng4** (e5g4): Attacks rook, but not forcing.
5. **Nf3** (e5f3): Retreat, not forcing.
6. **Qf3** (d1f3): Threatens mate on f7, but not immediate.

Let's look at **Nf5+** (e5f7):

- 1. Nf7+ Kxf7 (forced, otherwise White wins a piece)
- Now, White can play Qf3+ (d1f3), threatening mate on f7 and f8.
- If Black plays Nf6 to block, then Nxg5+ wins the rook on h6.
- Alternatively, after Nf7+, if Black plays Ke8, then Nxg5 wins the rook.

But let's check if **Nf7+** is the most forcing.

**Calculate 1. Nf7+ Kxf7 2. Qf3+ Nf6 3. Nxg5+ Kg8 4. Qxf6 Rxf6**
- White is up a rook and a pawn, with a winning position.

Alternatively, after **Nf7+**, if Black plays Ke8:
- 1. Nf7+ Ke8 2. Nxg5, White wins the rook.

**Is there a more direct mate?**
- 1. Qh5 Nf6 (blocks, covers e8)
- 2. Nf5+ Bxf5 (if ...Ke6, then Qe8# is not possible because of the knight)
- Not as forcing.

**Is there a way to win more material?**
- 1. Nf7+ is the most forcing, wins the rook, and keeps the attack.

**Final move:**
```
e5f7
```

2025-06-21 23:50:15,982 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.70s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (h5):**

- White: King on g1, rook on a1 and f1, queen on d1, bishop on c1, knight on f7 and g7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e7, rook on h5 and g5, bishop on f8 and b8, knight on e4 and b8, pawns on a3, b7, c5, d6, h7.

**Material:**
- White: Up a rook and a pawn (White has two rooks, Black has two, but White has both knights on the 7th and Black has a bishop and knight).
- Black: Down material, but has some activity with rooks on the kingside.

**Threats:**
- Black's last move was ...Rh5, possibly aiming for ...Rxh2 or ...Rg2+.
- White's knights on f7 and g7 are very powerful, especially f7, which is threatening to jump to h8 or d8.
- White's queen and bishop are not yet developed, but the queen has access to the kingside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxh5** (d1h5): Captures the rook, but is it safe? After Qxh5, Black can play Nf6, attacking the queen and threatening mate on g2.
2. **Nxh5** (g7h5): Captures the rook with the knight, but then Black can play Nf6, attacking the knight and threatening mate.
3. **Qf3** (d1f3): Defends g2 and attacks the knight on e4.
4. **Qe2** (d1e2): Defends g2 and keeps the queen flexible.
5. **Nxd6** (f7d6): Captures a pawn with check, but after Kxd6, White loses the knight.
6. **Qxh5** (d1h5): Let's analyze this further.

**Deep analysis of Qxh5:**
- 21. Qxh5 Nf6 (threatening ...Rxg2+ and ...Ng4)
- 22. Qh4 (defending g2)
- Black has no immediate threats. White is up a rook.

**Deep analysis of Nxh5:**
- 21. Nxh5 Nf6 (threatening ...Ng4 and ...Rxg2+)
- 22. Nxf6 Kxf6 (White is up a rook, but Black has some activity)

**Deep analysis of Qf3:**
- 21. Qf3 Nf6 (attacking the queen)
- 22. Nxg5 (if possible) or Qg3 (defending g2)

**Is there a forced mate?**
- After Qxh5, Black's only check is Rxg2+, but White can play Kxg2.

**Conclusion:**
- Qxh5 wins a rook and keeps the initiative. Black has no immediate threats. White is up a full rook and should win.

**Final move:**
```
d1h5

2025-06-21 23:52:00,345 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.12s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 6 Pawns
- Black: Bishop, Bishop, Knight, Queen, 5 Pawns

**King Safety:**
- White's king is on g1, relatively safe.
- Black's king is on e7, exposed and vulnerable.

**Threats:**
- White has a knight on f7, threatening to jump to h8 or d8.
- The queen on h5 is very active, eyeing the kingside and center.
- Black's pieces are awkwardly placed, and the king is in the center.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qh5xg5**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't create an immediate threat.
2. **Nf7xh8**: Captures a rook, but the knight may get trapped.
3. **Qh5h7+**: Forces the king to f8 (as Kd8 allows Nf7xd8+ winning the queen).
4. **Nf7xd6+**: Forks king and bishop, but after Kxd6, White loses the knight.
5. **Qh5g6**: Attacks the bishop on f5, but Black can defend.
6. **Qh5h6**: Threatens mate on g7, but Black can defend with Nf6.

**Critical Tactic:**
- **Qh5h7+**: If Kf8, then Nf7xd8, forking king and queen. If Ke8, then Qg8# is mate.

Let's calculate:
1. Qh5h7+ Kf8
   - Nf7xd8, White wins the queen.
2. Qh5h7+ Ke8
   - Qg8# is checkmate.

**Conclusion:** Qh5h7+ is a powerful check, either winning the queen or delivering mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h5h7

2025-06-21 23:53:23,044 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.47s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1n3b2/1p1bkNNQ/3p4/3P2p1/2p1n3/p7/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 23

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 7 pawns
- Black: 2 Bishops, Knight, 2 Rooks, 6 pawns

**Key features:**
- Black's king is on d7, exposed.
- White's queen is on h7, threatening.
- White's knight on f7 attacks d8 and h8.
- Black's bishop on f8, knight on b8, bishop on d7, rook on a8, rook on h8.
- Black's king is boxed in, with limited escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h7h8**: Queen to h8, check. Black must respond.
2. **f7h8**: Knight to h8, check. But then Black can take with rook.
3. **h7g8**: Queen to g8, check. King can't move, only bishop can block.
4. **h7g6**: Queen to g6, check. King can't move, bishop can block.
5. **g7e8**: Rook to e8, check. Bishop can block.
6. **g7e6**: Rook to e6, check. King can't move, bishop can block.
7. **c1g5**: Bishop to g5, attacking queen and pinning bishop.

**Let's check the most forcing moves:**

### 1. h7h8+
- Black must respond. Only move is ...Bh6 (since king can't move, and knight can't block).
- Then Qxh6, and if Rxh6, Nxh6, and White is up a queen for a rook and has a crushing attack.

### 2. h7g8+
- King can't move.
- Only move is ...Be7.
- Then Qe6+ (supported by knight), king can't move, only ...Kc7.
- Then Qxe7+, winning a piece and keeping the attack.

### 3. f7d8+
- Knight to d8, check. King can't move, only ...Kxd8.
- Then Qxf8+, king must move to c7, and White wins a rook.

### 4. f7h8+
- Knight to h8, check. Rook takes, queen takes, king can't move, only bishop can block.

### 5. h7e4
- Queen to e4, check. King can't move, only bishop can block.

### 6. g7e8+
- Rook to e8, check. Bishop can block.

### 7. c1g5
- Bishop to g5, attacking the bishop, but not as forcing as the checks.

**Best move:**
- The most forcing and likely winning move is **h7h8+**. After ...Bh6, Qxh6, Rxh6, Nxh6, White is up a queen for a rook and has a decisive attack.

**Final move:**
```
h7h8
```

**FEN:** 1n3b1Q/1p1bkNN1/3p4/2nP2p1/2p5/p7/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 24

**White:** King g1, Rook f1, Bishop c1, Queen h8, Knights f7 & g7, pawns a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King d7, Rook (none), Bishop f8, Queen (none), Knights b8 & c5, pawns a3, b7, c4, d6, g5

**Material:**  
White: Q, 2N, R, B, 7P  
Black: 2N, B, 5P

White is up a queen for a bishop and two knights, but Black has some advanced pawns and a passed a-pawn. However, White's queen and knights are extremely active and Black's king is exposed.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White's queen on h8 is very active.
- White's knight on f7 attacks d8 and h6.
- White's knight on g7 attacks e6 and h5.
- Black's king is on d7, somewhat exposed.
- Black's bishop on f8 is passive.

Let's analyze the position again:

FEN: 1n3b1Q/1p1bkNN1/3p4/2nP2p1/2p5/p7/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 24

White to move.

**Key points:**
- White's queen is on h8, knights on f7 and g7, rook f1, bishop c1.
- Black's king is on d7, bishop f8, knights b8 and c5, pawns a3, b7, c4, d6, g5.

**Immediate threats and opportunities:**
- White's queen and knights are very active.
- Black's king is exposed.
- White can deliver a check with the queen: Qxf8+ is possible.
- After Qxf8+, if Black replies with Kc7, White can continue the attack.
- If Black plays Kc8, White can continue to press.

Let's check the move Qxf8+:
- Qxf8+ forces Black to respond.
- If Kc7, White can play Ne8+ (with the knight on g7), forking king and bishop.
- If Kd8, White can play Ne6+ (forking king and bishop).

This looks like a strong forcing move.

**Let's check the legal moves list:**

- g7h5 (Nh5)
- f7d8 (Nd8+)

- b2b3 (b3)

- f2f4 (f4)
- b2b4 (b4)

But Qxf8+ is not in the legal moves list, which means the bishop is protected by the king, and the queen can't capture it.

So, let's look for the best check or threat.

**Move g7e6 (Ne6+) is a check.**
- If Black plays Nxe6, then dxe6+ wins material.
- If Black plays Ke8, then Qxf8# is mate.
- If Black plays Kc8, then Qxf8+ wins the bishop.

**Let's check g7e6 (Ne6+):**
- If Black plays Nxe6, then dxe6+ forks king and bishop.
- If Black plays Ke8, Qxf8# is mate.
- If Black plays Kc8, Qxf8+ wins the bishop.

This looks like a very strong move.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
g7e6
```

2025-06-21 23:55:30,009 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.33s):
Let's analyze the position:

White:
- King on g1
- Rook on a1, f1
- Bishop on c1
- Queen on h8
- Knights on e6, f7
- Pawns: a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2

Black:
- King on d7
- Bishop on f8
- Knights on a6, c5
- Pawns: a3, b7, c4, d6, g5

Material: White is up a queen for a bishop and knight, and has a dominating position. Black's king is exposed, and White's queen and knights are extremely active.

Threats:
- White threatens Nxf8, winning the bishop.
- White can also consider Qxf8, but that's not check.
- White can also consider Qh3, threatening mate on d7, but the queen is already very powerful on h8.
- The move Nxf8 is very strong, as it wins a piece and threatens further devastation.

Tactics:
- Nxf8 is a check, forcing Black's king to move.
- After Nxf8+, Black's king has to move (to e8 or c7), and White's queen and knights will dominate.

Let's check Nxf8+:

1. Nxf8+ Kc7 (if Kd8, then Ne6+ forks king and bishop)
2. Ne6+ (forks king and bishop, but let's see if there's something more direct)
3. Qg7+ (if king moves to b6, then Qc7# is mate)

Alternatively, after Nxf8+ Kc7, White can play Qg7+ and then Qc7#.

Let's check the line:

1. Nxf8+ Kc7
2. Qg7+ Kb6
3. Qc7#

So, Nxf8+ is a forced mate in 3.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e6f8
```

2025-06-21 23:55:40,526 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.27s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5N1Q/1p1bkN2/n2p4/2nP4/2p3p1/p7/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 26

**White:** King g1, Rook a1, Bishop c1, Queen h8, Knights f8 & f7, pawns b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King d7, Bishop d7, Knights a6 & c5, pawns a3, b7, c4, d6, g4

**Material:** White is up a queen for a bishop and two knights, but Black has dangerous advanced pawns and some piece activity.  
**King safety:** Black's king is exposed on d7. White's queen and knights are menacing.  
**Tactics:** White's queen on h8 is very powerful, and the knights on f8 and f7 are close to the Black king.

Let's look for forcing moves: checks, captures, threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qh8-g8+ (check)
2. Qh8-h7 (threatening mate ideas)
3. Nf8xd7 (capture)
4. Nf7xd6 (capture)
5. Nf7-h6 (threatening mate ideas)
6. Nf7-g5 (threatening mate ideas)
7. Nf7-e5 (centralizing, but less forcing)

**Let's check Qh8-g8+:**
- 1. Qg8 is check. Black's only legal move is ...Kc7 (since the bishop on d7 is pinned by the queen).
- After 1...Kc7, White can play Qd8# (mate), but let's check if that's possible.
- Wait: after 1. Qg8+ Kc7, the queen is not on d8, but on g8.
- Let's see if there are any mates after Qg8+.

**What about Nf8xd7+:**
- 1. Nxd7+ Kxd7 (forced)
- Then Qh7+ (check), Kc8 (only move), Qc7# is mate.

Let's check this line:
1. Nf8xd7+ Kxd7
2. Qh7+ Kc8
3. Qc7#

This is a forced mate in three.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
f8d7

2025-06-21 23:55:49,790 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.67s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 7Q/1p1NkN2/n2p4/3P4/2p3p1/p2n4/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 27

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 6 Pawns
- Black: Queenless, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 6 Pawns

But in this position, White has a *huge* material advantage: White has a Queen, Black does not. White's pieces are also very active, and Black's king is nowhere to be seen (so it's castled or on the back rank). White's queen is on h8, which is extremely aggressive.

**Threats and Tactics:**
- The queen on h8 is menacing. 
- Black's king is not visible, but the only way for Black to be alive is if the king is on g8 or h8, but the queen is there.
- White's knight on f7 is attacking d6 and h6.
- White's knight on d7 is attacking b8, f8, b6, f6, e5, c5.
- Black's knight on d3 is attacking b2, c1, e1, f2, f4, e5.
- Black's knight on a6 is not doing much.
- White's rook on f1 is on the open file.

**Immediate Candidate Moves:**
- h8g8 (Queen to g8, possibly threatening mate or winning material)
- f7h6 (Knight to h6, threatening mate or forking)
- d7f8 (Knight to f8, possibly threatening mate or forking)
- c1h6 (Bishop to h6, threatening mate or forking)
- f7d8 (Knight to d8, forking or threatening)
- f7g5 (Knight to g5, threatening mate or forking)
- f7e5 (Knight to e5, threatening mate or forking)

But let's check for mate threats:

**Is there a forced mate?**
- h8g8: Queen to g8. If Black's king is on g8, this is mate. But if not, let's see.
- f7h6: Knight to h6, threatening mate on g8 if the king is on g8.
- d7f8: Knight to f8, threatening mate or forking.

But let's check the move **Qh8-g8**:
- If Black's king is on g8, this is checkmate.
- If not, it could be a check, and White can follow up.

Alternatively, **Nf7-h6** threatens mate on g8 if Black's king is on g8.

But let's check the move **Nf7-h6**:
- If Black's king is on g8, Nh6# is mate.
- If not, it could be a check.

But the queen on h8 is very powerful. Let's check if **Qh8-g8** is mate.

**Let's check the legality of Qh8-g8:**
- The move is legal.
- If the king is on g8, this is mate.

Given the position, the best move is to play for mate or maximum pressure.

**Final move:**
```
h8g8
```

2025-06-21 23:55:55,108 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.85s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (g8), 2 Knights (d7, f7), Rook (f1), Bishop (c1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: Bishop (none), Queen (none), Rook (none), Knights (none), pawns (a3, b5, c4, d3, g4), King (not visible, but must be on the board)

**King safety:**
- White's king is on g1, safe.
- Black's king is not visible, but the only possible square is h8 (since g8 is occupied by White's queen).

**Threats:**
- White's queen is on g8, directly in front of Black's king (h8).
- White has a knight on f7, which covers h8 and g5.
- White has a knight on d7, which covers f8, e5, b6, c5.
- Black's only hope is to avoid mate or perpetual.

**Immediate tactics:**
- The queen on g8 is threatening Qh8# (checkmate), but the knight on f7 already covers h8, so the king is already mated if it is on h8.

But let's check: Is Black's king on h8? The FEN does not show a king, but the only possible square is h8.

**Legal moves:**
- All legal moves for White are listed, including g8h8 (which would be Qh8# if Black's king is on h8).

**Conclusion:**
- The move g8h8 is checkmate.

My move:
```
g8h8
```

2025-06-21 23:56:03,150 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.57s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (h8), 2 Knights (d7, f7), Rook (f1), Bishop (c1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: No visible pieces on the board, but from the FEN, Black has pawns on a3, b5, c4, c5, d6, g4, g5

**King Safety:**
- White's king is on g1, very safe.
- Black's king is not visible, but from the FEN, Black has no king on the board, which means White is to move and Black's king is likely on the queenside or off the board (possibly a puzzle or a bug in the FEN). However, let's proceed as if it's a normal position.

**Threats:**
- White's queen is on h8, threatening h7 and g7 squares.
- White's knights are deep in enemy territory (d7, f7).
- Black's pawns are advanced, but none are immediately threatening promotion.

**Candidate Moves:**
- h8g8 (Queen to g8, threatening mate on g7)
- h8f8 (Queen to f8, threatening f7)
- h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8 (Queen to back rank, but not threatening much)
- h8h7 (Queen to h7, threatening mate on h8)
- f7d8 (Knight to d8, not threatening)
- f7h6 (Knight to h6, threatening g8)
- f7d6 (Knight to d6, not threatening)
- f7g5 (Knight to g5, not threatening)
- f7e5 (Knight to e5, not threatening)
- d7f8 (Knight to f8, not threatening)
- d7b8 (Knight to b8, not threatening)
- d7f6 (Knight to f6, not threatening)
- d7b6 (Knight to b6, not threatening)
- d7e5 (Knight to e5, not threatening)
- d7c5 (Knight to c5, not threatening)
- c1h6 (Bishop to h6, threatening mate on g7)
- c1g5 (Bishop to g5, not threatening)
- c1f4 (Bishop to f4, not threatening)
- c1e3 (Bishop to e3, not threatening)
- c1d2 (Bishop to d2, not threatening)

**Tactical Considerations:**
- The queen on h8 is very powerful, and the knight on f7 supports a mate on h6 or g5.
- c1h6 is a strong move, threatening mate on g7, and Black cannot stop it.

**Best Move:**
- c1h6 threatens Qg7# and there is no way for Black to stop it, as the knight on f7 covers g8 and h8, and the queen on h8 covers the 8th rank.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c1h6
```

2025-06-21 23:56:09,933 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.17s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (h8), Bishop (h6), Knight (d7), Rook (a1, f1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, g3, h2)
- Black: King (f7), Knight (a6), pawns (a3, b5, c4, c5, d6, g4)

**Positional factors:**
- White's queen is on h8, a powerful spot.
- White's bishop on h6 is eyeing g7 and f8.
- White's knight on d7 is very active, controlling key squares.
- Black's king is on f7, exposed.
- Black's knight on a6 is out of play.
- Black's queenside pawns are advanced but not immediately threatening.

**Immediate tactics:**
- The Black king is vulnerable.
- White can consider Qf8# (but the queen is on h8, so not possible in one move).
- The bishop on h6 can move with tempo, possibly threatening mate or winning material.
- The knight on d7 can jump to f6 with check, but f6 is protected by the g4 pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qf8+ (not possible, queen is on h8)
2. Qh7+ (forces Kg6, then Qg7# is mate)
3. Qf6+ (not possible, queen is on h8)
4. Qh5+ (forces Kg7, then Qg5+ and mate soon)
5. Qh7+ (again, looks promising)

Let’s check Qh7+:
- 1. Qh7+ Ke8 (if Kg6, then Qg7# is mate)
- 1... Kf6 (illegal, f6 is protected)
- 1... Ke7 (illegal, d7 knight covers e7)
- 1... Kf8 (illegal, f8 is covered by bishop)
- 1... Ke8 (only legal move)

After 1. Qh7+ Ke8, what next?
- 2. Qg8# is mate (the king cannot escape).

**Checkmate sequence:**
1. Qh7+ Ke8 (forced)
2. Qg8# (mate)

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h8h7
```

2025-06-21 23:56:16,080 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.68s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (e8):**
- White: King on g1, rook on f1 and a1, queen on h7, bishop on h6, knight on d7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, knight on a6, pawns on a3, b5, c4, c5, d6, g4.

**Material:**
- White is up a queen for a rook and has a very strong attack.
- Black's king is exposed and surrounded by White's pieces.

**Immediate threats:**
- White's queen and bishop are both attacking the Black king.
- The knight on d7 is very close to the Black king.
- Black's king is on e8, with no immediate defenders.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qg8+ (h7g8): King must move to e7 or d8 (but d8 is covered by the knight).
2. Qf8+ (h7f8): King must move to d7 or e7 (but d7 is covered by the knight).
3. Qh8+ (h7h8): King must move to e7 or d8 (but d8 is covered).
4. Nf6+ (d7f6): King must move to d8 or e7 (but d8 is covered).
5. Qe7+ (h7e7): King must move to f7 or d8 (but d8 is covered).
6. Qh5+ (h7h5): King must move to d8 or f7 (but d8 is covered).

Let's check the most forcing move: 
- Qg8+ (h7g8): If Ke7, then Qf8# is mate.
- If Kd8, not possible (covered by knight).
- If Qg8+ Ke7, Qf8# is checkmate.

Let's verify:
1. h7g8+ Ke7
2. h7f8#

This is a forced mate in two.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h7g8
```

FEN: 6Q1/3k4/n2p3B/1pnP4/2p3p1/p7/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 32

White: King on g1, Queen on g8, Bishop on h6, Rook on a1, f1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on d7, Knight on a6, pawns on a3, b5, c4, d6, g4, c5

Material: White is up a queen and bishop for a rook and knight, with extra pawns. Black's king is exposed and White's queen is very active. Black's pieces are mostly on the queenside and not defending the king.

Immediate threats:
- White's queen is on g8, eyeing the back rank and the 8th file.
- White's bishop on h6 controls key diagonals and can swing to f8 or g7.
- Black's king is on d7, with some pawn cover but limited mobility.

Candidate moves:
1. Qf7+ (forces the king to c8 or d8, but c8 is covered by the bishop)
2. Qg7 (threatening Qxg4, but not a direct threat)
3. Qe6+ (forces Kc7 or Kd8, but Kc7 is covered by the bishop)
4. Qxg4+ (wins a pawn, but not a direct threat)
5. Bf8 (threatens Qe6+ and mates)
6. Qe8+ (forces Kc7 or Kc8, but not a direct threat)
7. Qf8 (threatens Qe7#)

Let's check Qf7+:

1. Qf7+ Kc8 (Kd8 is not possible, c8 is covered by bishop)
2. Qe8+ Kc7
3. Qc6+ Kd8
4. Bg5#

Alternatively, after Qf7+ Kc8, White can play Qe8+ and if Kc7, then Qc6+ wins the knight or continues the attack.

Let's check Qe6+:

1. Qe6+ Kc7 (Kd8 is not possible)
2. Qe7+ Kc8
3. Qe8+ Kc7
4. Qc6+ Kd8
5. Bg5#

So, Qe6+ seems to lead to a similar line.

What about Bf8? It threatens Qe7# and Qe8#.

1. Bf8 Kc7 (if Kd8, then Qe7#)
2. Qe7+ Kc8
3. Qe8+ Kc7
4. Qc6+ Kd8
5. Bg5#

So, Bf8 is a quiet move, but threatens mate and forces Black to respond.

Is there a forced mate in one? Let's check Qe8+:

1. Qe8+ Kc7
2. Qc6+ Kd8
3. Bg5#

So, Qe8+ is a forcing move.

But Qf7+ seems to be the most direct, as it forces the king to c8, then Qe8+ and Qc6+.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
Qg8f7
```

2025-06-21 23:57:01,211 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 13.62s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (f7), Bishop (h6), Rook (a1, f1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)
- Black: King (d8), Knight (a6, c5), pawns (a3, b5, c4, d6, g4)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed and on the back rank.
- White's queen is very active on f7.
- White's bishop on h6 is eyeing the f8 square and can potentially join an attack.
- Black's pieces are far from their king and not defending well.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate or a decisive material gain?
- Let's check checks first.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qf7-g8+ (forces Kg8, only move)
2. Qf7-f8+ (forces Kd7, only move)
3. Qf7-e8+ (forces Kc7, only move)
4. Qf7-h7 (no immediate threat)
5. Bh6-f8 (threatens mate on e7, but not immediate)
6. Bh6-g7 (no immediate threat)
7. Bh6-g5 (no immediate threat)
8. Bh6-f4 (no immediate threat)
9. Bh6-e3 (no immediate threat)
10. Bh6-d2 (no immediate threat)
11. Bh6-c1 (no immediate threat)

Let's check the forcing moves:

**1. Qf7-g8+**
- Black must play Kd7 (only legal move).
- After that, White can play Bh6-f8, threatening mate on e7, but Black can defend with Nc7 or b4.

**2. Qf7-f8+**
- Black must play Kd7.
- Then, White can play Bh6-f8, threatening mate on e7, but again, Black can defend with Nc7 or b4.

**3. Qf7-e8+**
- Black must play Kc7.
- White can play Bh6-f8, but Black can play Nb7, defending e7.

**Are there any immediate mates?**
- No forced mate in one, but White's queen and bishop are dominating.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Keeping the queen on f7 is strong, but giving checks may drive the king further into the open.
- Bh6-f8 is a strong move, threatening Qe7#.

**Let's calculate Bh6-f8:**
- If Bh6-f8, Black has no way to stop Qe7# except by blocking with a knight or pawn.
- After Bh6-f8, Black can play Nc7, but then Qe7# is not possible because the queen is blocked.
- Alternatively, after Bh6-f8, Black can try b4, but that doesn't help.

**What about Qf7-f8+?**
- Kd7, then Bh6-f8, and again, Nc7 is possible.

**What about Qf7-g8+?**
- Kd7, Bh6-f8, Nc7.

**What about Qf7-c7+?**
- Not a legal move.

**What about Qf7-b7?**
- Not a legal move.

**What about Qf7-a7?**
- Not a legal move.

**What about Qf7-c7?**
- Not a legal move.

**What about Qf7-e7?**
- Not a legal move.

**What about Qf7-d7?**
- Not a legal move.

**What about Qf7-h7?**
- Not a check, but threatens Qh8+ and Qg8+.

**What about Qf7-g7?**
- Not a check, but threatens Qg8+.

**What about Qf7-e6?**
- Not a check, but threatens Qe8+.

2025-06-21 23:57:22,933 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.50s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (g8), Bishop (h6), Rook (f1, a1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, g1, h2)
- Black: King (d7), Knight (a6, c5), pawns (a3, c4, d6, g4)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is on d7, surrounded by its own pieces and pawns, but exposed.
- White's queen is very active on g8, and the bishop on h6 is eyeing key diagonals.

**Threats:**
- White threatens Qf7#, but the square is covered by the knight on c5.
- White's queen and bishop are very active, and Black's king is vulnerable.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qf7+**: Not possible, as the queen is on g8 and f7 is not a legal move.
2. **Qxg4**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't threaten immediate mate.
3. **Qf8**: Moves queen to f8, possibly threatening Qe7+ or Qd8+.
4. **Qe6**: Queen to e6, check, but the king can escape to c7 or c8.
5. **Qxg5**: Queen captures g5 pawn, threatening Qg7+ and Qg8+.
6. **Qh7**: Queen to h7, threatening Qh8+ and Qh6+.
7. **Bh6-g7**: Bishop to g7, attacking the knight on c5 and possibly threatening Bf6.
8. **Bh6-g5**: Bishop to g5, attacking the knight on c5 and possibly threatening Bf6.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- The Black king is boxed in by its own pieces and pawns.
- White's queen and bishop can coordinate for a mating net.
- The move Qg8-h7 threatens Qh8+ and Qh6+.
- The move Qg8-g7 threatens Qg8+ and Qg6+.

**Best Move Calculation:**
Let's check if there is a forced mate or a way to increase pressure.

**Move 1: Qg8-h7**
- Threatens Qh8+ and Qh6+.
- If Black plays ...Kd8, then Qh8+ is mate.
- If Black plays ...Kc8, then Qh8+ is mate.

**Move 2: Qg8-g7**
- Threatens Qg8+ and Qg6+.
- Doesn't seem to create immediate threats.

**Move 3: Bh6-g7**
- Attacks the knight, but doesn't create a direct threat.

**Move 4: Qg8-e6+**
- King can move to c7 or c8.

**Move 5: Qg8-g4**
- Captures a pawn, but doesn't create a direct threat.

**Move 6: Qg8-h8**
- Queen to h8, threatening Qh6+ and Qh7+.

**Move 7: Bh6-g5**
- Attacks the knight, but doesn't create a direct threat.

**Move 8: Qg8-g5**
- Captures a pawn, but doesn't create a direct threat.

**Move 9: Qg8-f8**
- Queen to f8, threatening Qe7+ or Qd8+.

**Move 10: Qg8-h8**
- Queen to h8, threatening Qh6+ and Qh7+.

**Conclusion:**
The move **Qg8-h7** seems to be the most promising, as it threatens mate on h8 and h6, and Black has no good defense.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g8h7

2025-06-21 23:57:41,412 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.07s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (h7), Bishop (h6), Rook (a1, f1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, g1, h2)
- Black: King (e8), Knight (a6, c5), pawns (a3, c4, c5, d6, g4)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on e8, with White's queen and bishop nearby.
- Black's knights and pawns are far from the king and unable to defend effectively.

**Threats:**
- White threatens Qg8# (mate), but the square is covered by Black's knight on c5.
- White's queen on h7 is dominant.
- White's bishop on h6 is eyeing f8 and g7.
- White can try to bring more pieces into the attack or deliver mate.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. Qg8+ (not legal, knight covers)
2. Qh8+ (forces Kd7, but then what?)
3. Qg7 (threatens Qg8#)
4. Qh5+ (forces Kd7, but then what?)
5. Qh8 (forces Kd7, then Qg7+ and Qg8# ideas)
6. Bf8 (threatens mate on e7, but not immediate)
7. Qh5+ (forces Kd7, then Qf7+)

Let's check Qh8+:

- 1. Qh8+ Kd7 (forced)
- 2. Qg7+ Kc8 (only move)
- 3. Qg8+ Kb7 (only move)
- 4. Qf7+ Nc7 (forced block)
- 5. Qxc7+ Kxc7
- 6. bxa3 (White is up a rook and should win easily)

But is there a forced mate?

Alternatively, Qg8+ is not legal. Qg7 threatens Qg8#, which is mate.

If 1. Qg7, Black must defend against Qg8#.

- 1... Ne6 (blocks g8)
- 2. dxe6 (removes the knight)
- Now Qg8# is unstoppable.

So, 1. Qg7 is a direct threat.

Let's check for any defense after 1. Qg7:

- 1... Ne6 2. dxe6
- 1... Kd8 2. Bg5+ Kc8 3. Qg8+ Kb7 4. Qf7+ Nc7 5. Qxc7+ Kxc7 6. bxa3

No defense. Qg7 is crushing.

**Final Move:**
```
h7g7

2025-06-21 23:57:50,598 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.50s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (g7), Bishop (h6), Rook (a1, f1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)
- Black: King (e8), Knight (a6, d7), pawns (a3, b5, c4, d6, g4)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on e8, surrounded by its own pieces and White's threats.
- White's queen is very active on g7, and the bishop on h6 is eyeing g5/f4/e3 squares.
- Black's knights are on a6 and d7, both somewhat passive.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- White's queen on g7 is very powerful, and Black's king is boxed in.
- The move `g7g8` (Qxg8+) is not check, but let's check for any forced mates or winning material.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **g7g8 (Qg8)**: Not check, but threatens Qe6+ or Qf7+.
2. **g7h8 (Qh8)**: Not check, but keeps queen on the h-file.
3. **g7g4 (Qg4)**: Attacks the c4 pawn and threatens Qe6+.
4. **h6g5 (Bg5)**: Pins the knight on d7, but not a direct threat.
5. **g1h2 (Kh2)**: Quiet move, unnecessary.
6. **f1e1 (Re1)**: Brings another piece into play.

**Forcing Moves:**
- Checks: None available.
- Captures: None immediate.
- Threats: Qg8 threatens Qe6+ or Qf7+.

**Key Idea:**
- The Black king is stuck on e8, and the only defenders are the knights and pawns.
- If White can bring another piece (rook) to the e-file, it could be decisive.
- The move `f1e1` threatens Re7, which could be deadly.

**Calculation:**
- After `f1e1`, Black has no checks, and White threatens Re7, which would be mate if the queen supports from g8 or g7.
- Black's only defense is to try to cover e7 or move the knight, but both knights are pinned or blocked.

**Alternative:**
- `g7g8` (Qg8) threatens Qe6+, but Black can play Nf8, blocking the check.

**Best Move:**
- `f1e1` is a strong, quiet move, threatening Re7 and bringing another attacker.

**Final Decision:**
```
f1e1
```

**FEN:** 3k4/3n2Q1/n2p3B/1p1P4/2p3p1/p7/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 w - - 10 37

**White:** Kg1, Qg7, Bh6, Ra1, Re1, pawns: a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** Kd8, Na6, Nd7, pawns: a3, b5, c4, d6, g4

**Material:** White is up a queen and bishop for two knights. Black's king is exposed, and White's queen is very active.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White's queen on g7 is menacing, and Black's king is on d8, with knights on a6 and d7.  
- White's bishop on h6 is eyeing the g5 square and controls important diagonals.
- Black's king is boxed in, and White has the move.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **Qg8+**: Forces the king to c7 or e7 (but e7 is covered by the queen and bishop), so only c7 is possible.
2. **Qe7+**: Forces the king to c8 or c7. If Kc8, then Qe8+ is mate.
3. **Qe8+**: If Kc7, then Qe7+ again.
4. **Qf7**: Not as forcing.
5. **Qg5+**: Not as forcing, as the king can escape.

Let's check **Qe7+**:

- 1. Qe7+ Kc8 (Kd8 is illegal, Ke8 is illegal, Kc7 is possible)
- 2. Qe8+ Kc7 (only move)
- 3. Qxa8 (wins the knight, but is it mate? Let's see.)

Alternatively, let's check **Qg8+**:

- 1. Qg8+ Kc7 (Kd8 is illegal, Ke7 is illegal)
- 2. Qxa8 (wins the knight, but is it mate? Let's see.)

Alternatively, **Qe8+**:

- 1. Qe8+ Kc7 (Kd8 is illegal, Ke8 is illegal)
- 2. Qxa8

Alternatively, **Qg5+**:

- 1. Qg5+ Kc7 (Kd8 is illegal, Ke8 is illegal)
- 2. Qe7 (threatening mate on d8 or c8)

But let's look for a forced mate. The Black king is on d8, and the queen can check on e7 or g8.

**Check for mate in two:**

- 1. Qe7+ Kc8 (only move)
- 2. Qe8+ Kc7 (only move)
- 3. Qxa8 (wins the knight, but not mate)

Alternatively, **Qe8+**:

2025-06-21 23:58:22,408 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.95s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (g8), Rook (e1), Rook (a1), Bishop (h6), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)
- Black: Knight (a6, c7), Bishop (none), pawns (a3, b5, c4, d6, g4), King (c7)

**Threats and Opportunities:**
- White's queen is on g8, eyeing the 8th rank and the g-file.
- White's bishop on h6 is very strong, controlling key diagonals and squares around Black's king.
- Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed.
- Black's knights are on a6 and c7, not very active.
- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on a3, but it's not immediately threatening.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- White can consider checks with the queen, rook lifts, or bishop moves.
- The move e1e7 is a strong candidate, threatening Re7+ and increasing pressure on the 7th rank.
- The move Qf7+ is not possible, but Qg7 is possible, but not a check.
- The move Qg8g7 attacks the c7 knight and keeps pressure.
- The move Qg8g4 attacks the g4 pawn, but that's not urgent.
- The move Qg8g6 attacks the g4 pawn and keeps pressure.

**Check Candidates:**
- No immediate checks with the queen.
- No immediate checks with the bishop.
- No immediate checks with the rook.

**Threats:**
- White can double rooks on the e-file or the first rank.
- White can try to invade with the queen on the 7th rank.

**Best Plan:**
- The move e1e7 threatens Re7+ and increases pressure on the 7th rank, possibly winning material or delivering mate soon.
- Black's king is boxed in, and White's pieces are ready to invade.

**Final Move:**
I believe the best move is to play the rook to e7, maximizing pressure and threatening Re7+.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 6Q1/2knR3/n2p3B/3P4/1pp3p1/p7/PPP2PP1/R5K1 w - - 0 39

**White:** Kg1, Qg8, Re7, Bh6, Ra1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** Kc7, Nc6, a3, b4, c4, d6, g4

**Immediate tactical observations:**
- Black's king is exposed on c7, with the knight on a6 and pawns on a3, b4, c4, d6.
- White's queen on g8 and rook on e7 are very active.
- White's bishop on h6 is eyeing the f8 and g7 squares.
- Black's knight on a6 is awkwardly placed.
- White has a passed d-pawn on d5.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qg8xg4**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't threaten mate.
2. **Re7-e8**: Puts pressure on the back rank, but Black can block with the knight.
3. **Re7-d7+**: Check, but Black can block with the knight or move the king.
4. **Re7-e6**: Attacks the knight and supports d5-d6.
5. **Bh6-g7**: Attacks the rook, but there is no rook on the board.
6. **Bh6-f8**: Attacks the rook, but again, no rook.
7. **Qg8-f7+**: Not a legal move.
8. **Qg8-h7**: Not a legal move.
9. **Re7-e1**: Retreats, not useful.
10. **Ra1-e1**: Doubles rooks, but not urgent.

**Check for forced mate:**
- **Re7-e8**: If ...Nc5, then Qf7+ Kb6, Rb8+ Ka5, Qc7+ Ka4, Qc6+ Ka5, Ra8# is a possible idea, but the knight on a6 covers b8.
- **Re7-e6**: Attacks the knight on c6 and supports d5-d6.
- **Qg8-g4**: Captures a pawn, but not forcing.

**Check for checks:**
- **Re7-d7+**: Kb6, then what?
- **Qg8-g7**: Not a check.
- **Qg8-f7+**: Not legal.

**Check for threats:**
- Black's only threat is to push c3 or b3, but White is well ahead.

**Best move analysis:**
- **Re7-e6**: Attacks the knight on c6, supports d5-d6, and threatens to win more material.
- **Re7-d7+**: Kb6, then Qg8xg4, but not decisive.
- **Qg8-g4**: Material gain, but not decisive.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Not immediately, but White is winning.

**Final evaluation:**
- **Re7-e6** is the strongest, attacking the knight and supporting d5-d6, increasing pressure and keeping all threats alive.

2025-06-21 23:59:50,129 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (g8), Rook (e6), Bishop (h6), Rook (a1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, g1, h2)
- Black: Knight (b8), King (c7), pawns (a3, b4, c4, d6, g4)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on c7.
- White's queen and rook are very active.
- White's bishop on h6 is eyeing the f8 square.
- Black's knight on b8 is not defending the king.

**Threats:**
- White threatens Qf7+ or Qg7+ ideas.
- White can consider Re7+ or Re8+.
- White's queen on g8 is extremely powerful.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qf7+ (not legal)
2. Qg7+ (not legal)
3. Re7+ (not legal)
4. Re8 (e6e8): threatens mate on b8, but knight can block.
5. Qg4 (not legal)
6. Qg5 (not legal)
7. Qg6 (not legal)
8. Qg7 (not legal)
9. Qg8 (already there)
10. Bh6-g7 (not legal)
11. Bh6-g5 (h6g5): attacks the c1 square, but not a direct threat.
12. Bh6-f8 (h6f8): attacks the knight on b8, threatens mate on e8 if knight moves.
13. Rook moves: e6-e8, e6-e7, e6-g6, e6-f6, e6-d6, e6-e5, e6-e4, e6-e3, e6-e2, e6-e1

**Tactical ideas:**
- If Re8 (e6e8), Black can play Nb8-d7, blocking.
- If Qg8-b8 (not legal).
- If Bh6-f8 (h6f8), threatens mate on e8 if knight moves.

**Best move:**
- e6e8 is strong, but after Nb8, no immediate mate.
- h6f8 threatens to win the knight and keeps up the pressure. If knight moves, Re8# is mate.

**Check for forced mate:**
- h6f8, if knight moves, Re8# is mate.
- Black has no good defense.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h6f8
```

2025-06-22 00:00:18,082 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.05s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1n3BQ1/2kn4/3pR3/3P4/1pp3p1/8/PpP2PP1/R5K1 w - - 0 41

**Material count:**
- White: Queen (g8), Rook (e6), Rook (a1), Bishop (f8), pawns on a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, g1 (King), h6
- Black: Queen (none), Rook (none), Bishop (none), Knight (b8), pawns on b4, b2, c4, d6, g4, King (c7)

**Immediate threats and opportunities:**
- White is up massive material (Queen, two Rooks, Bishop vs. Knight and pawns).
- Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed.
- White's Queen on g8 and Bishop on f8 are both very active.
- The Rook on e6 is also very strong, controlling the e-file and 6th rank.
- Black's only piece is the Knight on b8, which is not active.
- Black's pawns are advanced on the queenside, but White's pieces dominate.

**Tactical ideas:**
- White can look for a forced mate or a decisive material gain.
- The Black king is on c7, with limited escape squares.
- The Queen on g8 and Bishop on f8 coordinate well, and the Rook on e6 can swing to the 7th or 8th rank.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qf7+ (g8f7): King must move, likely to c8 or b6.
2. Re7 (e6e7): Doubling up on the 7th rank, but not a direct threat.
3. Re8 (e6e8): Threatens mate on b8 if the knight moves, but not immediate.
4. Qg7 (g8g7): Not a direct threat.
5. Ree1 (a1e1): Not urgent.
6. Qg8-h8 or Qg8-h7: Not threatening.

**Let's calculate Qf7+ (g8f7):**
- If 1. Qf7+ Kc8 (only move)
- 2. Re8# (e6e8) is checkmate! The knight on b8 is pinned and can't block, and the king can't escape.

**Let's check for any better move:**
- Is there a mate in one? No, not immediately.
- Is there a faster mate? No.

**Conclusion:** The move Qf7+ (g8f7) leads to forced mate in two.

**Final move:**
```
g8f7
```

Let's analyze the position:

White:
- King on g1
- Queen on f7
- Rook on e6
- Bishop on f8
- Pawns: a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2

Black:
- King on c7
- Rook on a1
- Knight on b8
- Pawns: b4, c4, d6, g4

It's White to move. Legal moves: g1h2, e6e1

Analysis:
- e6e1 is a rook move to the back rank, threatening e.g. Qe8# if the rook is not captured.
- g1h2 is a king move, but doesn't seem to do much.

If we play e6e1, Black cannot stop Qe8# next move, since the only piece that could block is the knight, but it can't reach e8 in one move. The rook on a1 is too far. Black has no checks or meaningful threats.

Therefore, e6e1 is a decisive move, threatening mate and controlling the e-file.

My move:
```
e6e1
```

2025-06-22 00:01:19,675 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.44s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (e1), Rook (f8), Queen (f7), King (g1), pawns (a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: Rook (b1), King (d7), Knight (b8), pawns (b4, c4, d6, g4)

**Immediate threats and tactical ideas:**
- White is up a queen for a knight and has a crushing material advantage.
- Black's king is exposed on d7.
- White's queen and rook are very active.
- Black's rook on b1 is not threatening immediate mate or checks.
- White can consider Qe8+ or Qe6+ to force the Black king further into the open.
- Rook on f8 is very powerful, controlling the f-file and 8th rank.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qe8+ (forces the king to c7 or c8, as Kd8 runs into Qe7#)
2. Qe6+ (forces the king to c7 or c8, similar idea)
3. Re7+ (forces the king to c8, after which Qe8# is mate)
4. Qf5+ (forces the king to d8 or c7, but less direct)
5. Qe7+ (forces the king to c8, then Qe8# is mate)

Let's check the most forcing move: **Qe8+**

- 43. Qe8+ Kc7 (Kd8 runs into Qe7#)
- 44. Re7+ (now Kb6 is forced, as Kc8 runs into Qe8#)
- 45. Qxb8#

Alternatively, after Qe8+ Kc7, Qe7+ Kc8, Qe8# is mate.

**So, Qe8+ is a direct path to mate.**

Let's check for any better or faster mate:

- Qe7+ Kc8 Qe8# is mate in two.
- Re7+ Kc8 Qe8# is mate in two.

But Qe7+ can be blocked by the knight (Nb7), so Qe8+ is more forcing.

**Final move:**
```
f7e8

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1n2Qn2/2k5/3p4/3P4/1pp3p1/8/P1P2PP1/1r2R1K1 w - - 0 44

White: King g1, Queen e8, Rook e1, Pawns a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, g1, h2  
Black: King c7, Rook b1, Knights b8, f8, Pawns b4, c4, d6, g4

**Material:**  
White: Q, R, 5P  
Black: R, 2N, 4P

White is up a queen for a rook and knight, but Black has some advanced pawns and minor piece activity. The White queen on e8 is extremely powerful, and Black's king is exposed.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White threatens Qxf8, winning a piece.
- Black's only real threat is pushing c3 or d3, but nothing immediate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qxf8: Wins a knight, but does it allow counterplay?
2. Qe7+: Checks the king, but c8 is covered by the knight.
3. Qe4: Centralizes, but not as forcing.
4. Qe2: Defends c4, but not necessary.
5. Re7+: Rook check, but king can escape to b6.

**Let's check Qxf8:**
- Qxf8, Rxe1+ (forced, otherwise White is just up a piece)
- Kh2 (or Kh1), Rxe8
- Qxe8, and White is up a queen for a rook and knight, with no immediate threats.

But after Qxf8, Rxe1+ Kh2, Rxe8, Qxe8, Black has no checks and White is completely winning.

**Is there a faster way to mate?**
- Qe7+ Kc8 (only move), Qe8 (back), nothing gained.
- Qe4: threatens Qxc4, but not as forcing.

**Any mating nets?**
- No immediate mate, but after Qxf8, White is up a full queen for a rook and knight, and Black has no compensation.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to capture the knight:

```
e8f8

2025-06-22 00:02:12,478 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.46s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1n3Q2/2k5/3p4/3P4/1p4p1/2p5/P1P2PP1/1r2R1K1 w - - 0 45

**Material count:**
- White: Queen (f8), Rook (e1), King (g1), pawns (a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, g1)
- Black: Rook (b1), King (c7), pawns (b4, c3, d6, g4)

**Key points:**
- White's queen is on f8, threatening the black king on c7.
- Black's rook is on b1, potentially threatening along the b-file.
- Black's king is exposed on c7.
- White's rook is on e1, ready to join the attack.
- Black's knight is on b8, currently not active.

**Immediate tactical ideas:**
- White can check with Qe7+ or Qf7+.
- White can also try to bring the rook into play, but the queen is already very active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qe7+ (forces the king to b6 or c8)
2. Qf7+ (forces the king to b6 or c8)
3. Qe8 (not a check, but threatens Qe7+)
4. Re7+ (not possible, rook is on e1)
5. Rxb1 (not possible, rook is on e1)
6. Qf4 (not a check, but attacks the pawn on g4)
7. Qg7+ (not possible, queen is on f8)

But wait, the queen is on f8, and the king is on c7. Let's check if there is a forced mate.

**Check for forced mate:**
- Qe7+ Kc8 (only move)
- Qe8+ Kc7 (only move)
- Qe7+ Kc8 (repetition)

So, Qe7+ leads to a draw by repetition if Black plays correctly.

What about bringing the rook into play?
- Re7+ is not possible.
- Rxb1 is not possible.

What about Qf7+?
- Qf7+ Kc8 (only move)
- Qe8+ Kc7 (only move)
- Qe7+ Kc8 (repetition)

Again, repetition.

What about a quiet move to improve position?
- a2a3 (prevents ...b3)
- f2f3 (prevents ...g3)
- g2g3 (prevents ...g3)
- f2f4 (tries to open the kingside)

But Black's c3 pawn is dangerous. If White does nothing, Black may play ...b3 and ...b2, pushing the passed pawns.

Is there a way to win material?
- Qf4 attacks g4, but after ...b3, Black is fast.

Is there a way to stop Black's pawns?
- a2a3, but after ...b3, a4, b2, Rxb1, cxb2, Rb1, Kxb1, c2+.

Is there a way to force a draw if not a win?
- Perpetual check with Qe7+ and Qf7+.

Is there a way to bring the rook to the seventh rank?
- Re7 is not possible.

Is there a way to threaten mate?
- Qe7+ Kc8, Qe8+ Kc7, Qe7+ Kc8, repetition.

Is there a way to win?
- No forced mate, but White can force a draw by perpetual check.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to force a draw by perpetual check, as Black's passed pawns are too dangerous and there is no forced mate.

**Final move:**
```
Qe7+
```

2025-06-22 00:02:22,476 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.66s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, Queen on e7, Rook on e1, pawns on a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on d7, Rook on b1, pawns on b4, c3, d6, g4

**Material:**
- White: Queen, Rook, 6 pawns
- Black: Rook, 4 pawns

White is up a queen for a rook and has a winning material advantage.

**Threats:**
- White threatens Qe7-e8+ or Qe7-d8+ for checks.
- Black's only real counterplay is with the b1 rook and passed pawns, but White's queen and rook dominate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qe7-d8+ (check)
2. Qe7-e8+ (check)
3. Qe7-f8+ (check)
4. Qe7-h4 (threatens mate on e8)
5. Rook moves (e1-f1, e1-d1, etc.)
6. King moves (g1-h2, etc.)

Let's check the checks:

**1. Qe7-d8+**
- Black must play Kxd8 (only move).
- Then White can play Re8+ and win the rook on b1 next.

**2. Qe7-e8+**
- Black must play Kxe8 (only move).
- Then White can play Re1-e8+ and win the king for the rook.

**3. Qe7-f8+**
- Black plays Kc7 (only move).
- White can continue with Qe7-e7+ or Qe7-d8+.

But the most forcing is **Qe7-d8+**.

**Line:**
1. Qe7-d8+ Kxd8
2. Re1xb1

White wins the rook and is completely winning.

**Double-checking for tactics:**
- No back-rank mates for Black.
- No perpetuals or stalemates.

**Conclusion:** The best move is the forcing check:

```
e7d8
```

2025-06-22 00:02:34,754 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.21s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3k4/3n4/3p4/3P4/1p4p1/2p5/P1P2PP1/1r2R1K1 w - - 0 47

**White:** King on g1, Rook on e1, pawns on a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on d8, Rook on b1, pawns on b4, c3, d6, g4, knight on d7

**Material:**  
- White: Rook + 6 pawns  
- Black: Rook + Knight + 4 pawns

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black's rook is active on b1, but not threatening immediate mate or pawn promotion.
- Black's c3 pawn is dangerous, but not queening yet.
- White's d5 pawn is advanced and could become a passed pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g1h2: King sidestep, but doesn't do much.
2. g1h1: King to corner, not useful.
3. g1f1: King centralizes, but could be exposed.
4. e1f1: Rook to f1, possibly to support f2-f4 or defend.
5. e1d1: Rook to d1, attacks d6 pawn and eyes d7 knight.
6. e1c1: Rook to c1, attacks c3 pawn.
7. e1b1: Rook trade, but White is down a piece, so not ideal.
8. g2g3: Prepares to challenge g4 pawn.
9. f2f3: Prepares to challenge g4 pawn.
10. a2a3: Attacks b4 pawn.
11. f2f4: Aggressive, but g4 pawn can capture.
12. a2a4: Attacks b4 pawn.

**Analysis:**
- Rook activity is crucial in endgames.
- White's d5 pawn is a strength, but Black's c3 pawn is also dangerous.
- Trading rooks (e1b1) is not favorable for White, as Black's knight will dominate.
- Rook to d1 (e1d1) attacks d6 and puts pressure on Black's position, possibly winning a pawn or tying down Black's pieces.
- Rook to c1 (e1c1) attacks c3, but Black can defend with knight or king.
- a2a3 or a2a4 attacks b4, but Black can ignore or defend.
- g2g3 or f2f3 tries to undermine Black's kingside pawns.

**Best move:**
- e1d1 is the most active, attacking d6 and d7, and possibly winning a pawn or tying down Black's pieces. It also keeps the rook active and central.

**Final move:**
```
e1d1

2025-06-22 00:02:55,811 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (d1), pawns (a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, g1), King (g1)
- Black: Rook (b1), pawns (b4, c3, d6, g4), King (d8)

**Positional factors:**
- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on c3 and another on d6.
- White's rook is more active, but Black's rook is on the first rank, which can be dangerous.
- White's king is relatively safe for now.
- White has a passed pawn on d5, but it's blockaded by Black's king.
- Black's pawns on the queenside are advanced and connected.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens to push c2, which could be dangerous.
- White needs to activate the rook and/or king, and possibly try to create counterplay with the kingside pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g1h2**: King sidestep, but doesn't change much.
2. **g1h1**: Similar, but less active.
3. **g1f1**: King toward the center, but exposes to checks.
4. **d1f1**: Rook to f1, possibly to support f2-f4 or defend the first rank.
5. **d1e1**: Rook centralizes, but doesn't threaten much.
6. **d1c1**: Rook to c1, attacking the c3 pawn directly.
7. **d1b1**: Rook trade, but Black's pawns are dangerous in the ending.
8. **g2g3**: Pawn move, but doesn't address c3.
9. **f2f3**: Weakens e3, doesn't help.
10. **a2a3**: Attacks b4 pawn, but Black can push c2.
11. **f2f4**: Aggressive, but Black's c-pawn is more dangerous.
12. **a2a4**: Attacks b4, but Black can ignore and push c2.

**Critical analysis:**
- The most urgent threat is Black's c3 pawn. If Black plays c2, White must be ready to stop it.
- **d1c1** directly attacks c3. If Black pushes c2, White can play Rxc2, sacrificing the rook for two pawns, but then White's king can help stop the d-pawn.
- If White plays d1c1 and Black plays Rxc1, White recaptures, but Black's pawns are still dangerous.
- If White plays d1c1 and Black plays b3, then cxb3, c2, White can play Rxc2.

**Best move:**
- **d1c1** is the most active and forces Black to respond to the threat on c3. It also keeps the rook on the board, which is essential for stopping Black's pawns.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d1c1
```

2025-06-22 00:03:15,428 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.92s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (c1), pawns (a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)
- Black: Rook (b1), pawns (b4, c3, d6, g4), King (e7), Knight (f8)

**Position:**
- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on c3 and active rook on b1.
- White's rook is on c1, controlling the c-file and eyeing the c3 pawn.
- White's king is on g1, somewhat far from the action.
- Black's king is on e7, more centralized.
- White has a passed pawn on d5, but it's blockaded by Black's d6 pawn.
- Black's knight is on f8, currently passive but can become active.
- White's pawns on the kingside are not under immediate threat.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's c3 pawn is close to queening, but White's rook on c1 controls c3.
- Black's rook on b1 is active, possibly threatening to invade the first rank.
- White has no immediate threats but must be careful not to allow Black's c-pawn to advance.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g1h2 / g1h1 / g1f1: King moves, but don't improve the position.
2. c1f1: Rook to f1, possibly to defend f2 or prepare to activate the rook.
3. c1e1: Rook to e1, attacking the e7 king, but no immediate threat.
4. c1d1: Rook to d1, attacking d6 pawn, but Black can defend or ignore.
5. c1b1: Rook trade, but Black's rook is more active, so trading may help White.
6. g2g3: Pawn move, possibly to restrict Black's knight or rook.
7. f2f3: Pawn move, but may weaken White's king.
8. a2a3 / a2a4: Pawn moves on the queenside, but don't address the main issues.
9. f2f4: Pawn move, but weakens e3 and doesn't help immediately.

**Deeper analysis:**
- Trading rooks with c1b1 may help White, as Black's rook is more active. After c1b1 Rb1b1+, White's king moves, and Black's c-pawn is still blockaded.
- If White plays c1d1, attacking d6, Black can play Rb1b2, defending d6 and keeping rook active.
- If White plays c1f1, rook can swing to the kingside to defend or attack.
- g2g3 is a useful waiting move, restricting Black's knight and giving the king luft.

**Best move:**
- Trading rooks with c1b1 seems to reduce Black's activity and makes the defense easier. After the trade, the c3 pawn is blockaded, and White can try to bring the king closer or attack Black's pawns.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c1b1
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move:**
- White: King on g1, rook on b1, pawns on a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on d7, knight on f8, pawns on b4, c3, d6, g4

**Material:**
- White: Rook + 6 pawns
- Black: Knight + 4 pawns

**Key features:**
- White is up a rook for a knight (material advantage).
- Black has advanced pawns on the queenside (b4, c3, d6), which could become dangerous if not contained.
- White's rook is active on the b-file, but not yet on the 7th rank.
- White's king is safe for now, but far from the action.
- White has a passed pawn on d5.

**Candidate moves:**

2. **b1b3**: Attacks c3 pawn, but Black can defend with ...a5 or ...Ng6.
3. **b1b2**: Passive, but keeps options.
4. **f2f3**: Tries to undermine Black's g4 pawn, but doesn't address queenside.
5. **g2g3**: Similar idea, but less direct.
6. **a2a3**: Attacks the b4 pawn, but Black can play ...a5.
7. **f2f4**: Aggressive, but could weaken White's kingside.
8. **g1h2 / g1h1 / g1f1**: King moves, but not urgent.
9. **b1f1**: Rook swing, but not immediately effective.

**Critical analysis:**
- The most urgent threat is Black's c3 pawn, which is close to queening.
- If White plays b1b4, Black can play ...a5, defending b4.
- If White plays b1b3, attacking c3, Black can play ...a5, and if Rxb3, then c2, and the pawn is dangerous.
- If White plays a2a3, Black can play ...a5, and the b4 pawn is still defended.
- If White plays f2f3, Black can ignore and push c2, which is dangerous.

**Best plan:**
- White needs to stop Black's queenside pawns from advancing.
- The move **b1b4** attacks the b4 pawn, and if Black defends with ...a5, White can play a2a3, and after ...bxa3, Rb3, attacking c3 and a3.
- Alternatively, White can consider b1b3, but after ...a5, Rxc3, bxc3, a4, Black's c-pawn is gone, but White's a-pawn is weak.

**Conclusion:**
- **b1b4** is the most active and direct move, putting pressure on Black's queenside and threatening to win a pawn.

Therefore, my move is:
```
b1b4
```

2025-06-22 00:03:46,064 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.41s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b4), pawns (a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, g1), King (g1)
- Black: Knight (f8), pawns (c3, d6, g4), King (e7)

**Position:**
- White is up a rook for a knight, but Black has dangerous passed pawns on c3 and d6, and a pawn majority on the kingside.
- White's rook is active on b4, and Black's king is centralized.
- Black's knight is on f8, not very active but can defend.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens to push c3-c2, creating a dangerous passed pawn.
- White can consider rook activity, especially targeting the d6 pawn or attacking the knight.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b4b7**: Rook to 7th, attacking d7 and possibly threatening Rb8.
2. **b4b8**: Rook to 8th, attacking the knight on f8.
3. **b4b6**: Rook to 6th, attacking d6 pawn directly.
4. **b4g4**: Rook attacks g4 pawn, but that pawn is defended by the knight.
5. **g2g3**: Trying to undermine Black's kingside pawns.
6. **f2f3**: Same idea, but weakens White's king.
7. **a2a4**: Not urgent.
8. **b4b5**: Rook to 5th, not threatening much.

**Deep analysis:**

- **b4b8**: If Rb8, attacking the knight. If Black plays c2, White can play Rc8, attacking the knight and threatening Rc7+. If Black plays Nd7, White can take d6 pawn with Rxc2, and the c-pawn is stopped.
- **b4b7**: If Rb7+, Ke8, then Rb8+ wins the knight, but Black can play c2, and after Rc8, Nd7, Rxc2, the same as above.
- **b4b6**: Rook attacks d6, but after c2, Rxd6, c1=Q+, Kh2, Qf4+, g3, Qxf2+, Black gets a queen with checks.

**Critical lines:**

- **b4b8 c2 Rc8 Nd7 Rxc3**: White wins the c3 pawn, and Black's d6 pawn is weak. White is winning.
- **b4b8 c2 Rc8 cxb2**: Not possible, since c2 is the only move.

**Conclusion:**
- **b4b8** is the most precise, attacking the knight and preparing to attack the c-pawn from behind if it advances.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b4b8
```

2025-06-22 00:03:58,855 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.37s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1R3n2/3k4/3p4/3P4/6p1/2p5/P1P2PP1/6K1 w - - 3 52

**White:** King on g1, rook on b8, pawns on a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on d7, knight on f8, pawns on c3, d6, g4

**Material:**  
White: Rook + 6 pawns  
Black: Knight + 3 pawns

White is up a rook for a knight, but Black has dangerous passed pawns (c3, d6, g4). White's rook is very active on the 8th rank, and Black's king is somewhat exposed.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rook moves: b8f8 (check), b8e8 (check), b8d8 (check), b8c8, b8a8, b8b7, b8b6, b8b5, b8b4, b8b3, b8b2, b8b1
- King moves: g1h2, g1h1, g1f1
- Pawn moves: g2g3, f2f3, a2a3, f2f4, a2a4

**Tactical considerations:**
- Rook checks: b8f8, b8e8, b8d8
- Black's king is on d7, so checks on the 8th rank force the king to move.
- b8f8+ forces the king to e7 or c7 (d8 is covered by the rook).
- b8e8+ forces the king to c7 or d8 (f8 is covered by the knight).
- b8d8+ forces the king to c7 or e7 (d8 is covered by the rook).

**Let's check b8f8+:**
- 1. b8f8+ Ke7 (if Kc7, then Rxf8 wins the knight)
- 2. Rxf8 Kxf8 (if Ke7, White can play f3, stopping the g-pawn, or d6-d7)

But after b8f8+ Kc7, Rxf8 wins the knight, and White is up a full rook.

**What about b8e8+?**
- 1. b8e8+ Kc7 (if Kd8, then Rxf8 wins the knight)
- 2. Rxf8 Kd7 (but then White is up a rook)

**What about b8d8+?**
- 1. b8d8+ Kc7 (if Ke7, then Rxf8 wins the knight)
- 2. Rxf8 Kxd8

In all cases, White wins the knight by checking and then capturing on f8.

**Is there any danger to White after winning the knight?**
- Black's c3 pawn is dangerous, but White's rook can come back to stop it.
- White's king is far, but Black's king is also not close to the queenside pawns.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to check with the rook and win the knight. All three checks (b8f8+, b8e8+, b8d8+) win the knight, but b8f8+ is the most direct.

**Final move:**
```
b8f8
```

2025-06-22 00:04:07,021 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.29s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (c7):**
- White: King on g1, rook on f8, pawns on a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on c7, pawns on c3, d6, g4

**Material:**
- White: Rook + 6 pawns
- Black: King + 3 pawns

**Key points:**
- White is up a rook for three pawns.
- Black's pawns are advanced but not immediately threatening.
- White's rook is on the 8th rank, which is ideal for cutting off the Black king.
- Black's king is cut off on the 7th and 8th ranks.
- White's king is safe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. f8h8: Rook to h8, possibly to attack the g4 pawn.
2. f8g8: Rook to g8, attacking the g4 pawn directly.
3. f8f7: Rook to f7, attacking the d7 square and possibly supporting d5-d6.
4. f2f3: Preparing to attack the g4 pawn.
5. g2g3: Also preparing to attack the g4 pawn.
6. a2a4: Starting to push the a-pawn.
7. f2f4: Immediate pawn break, but g4xg3 is possible.

**Analysis:**
- The most urgent threat is Black's c3 and d6 pawns, but they are not immediately queening.
- White can attack the g4 pawn with the rook, but after f8g8, Black can play c2, and if White takes on g4, Black can push d5.
- White can also play f2f3 or g2g3 to attack the g4 pawn with a pawn, but this is slower.

**Best plan:**
- Attack the g4 pawn immediately with the rook. f8g8 is the most direct.
- If Black pushes c2, White can play Rc1, and the c-pawn is stopped.
- If Black tries to support with d5, White can take on g4 and then use the rook to mop up the pawns.

**Calculation:**
1. f8g8 c2
2. Rc1 (stopping the pawn)
3. If d5, then Rxc2, and White is winning.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to attack the g4 pawn with the rook, f8g8.

```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 6R1/2k5/3p4/3P4/8/2p3p1/P1P2PP1/6K1 w - - 0 54

**White:** King on g1, rook on g8, pawns on a2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King on c7, pawns on c3, d6, g3

**Material:**  
White: Rook + 6 pawns  
Black: King + 3 pawns

**Key features:**
- White is up a rook for 3 pawns.
- Black's c3 and d6 pawns are advanced, but White's rook is very active.
- White's king is far from the action, but Black's king is also cut off from the kingside.
- Black's g3 pawn is dangerous, but White can consider f2-f3 to blockade.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8h8**: Rook to h8, possibly to support h2-h3 or to swing to the h-file.
2. **g8f8**: Rook to f8, eyeing f2 and possibly f3.
3. **g8e8**: Rook to e8, centralizing.
4. **g8d8**: Rook to d8, attacking d6 pawn.
5. **g8c8**: Rook to c8, attacking c3 pawn.
6. **g8b8**: Rook to b8, not very useful.
7. **g8a8**: Rook to a8, not very useful.
8. **g8g7**: Rook to g7, not useful.
9. **g8g6**: Rook to g6, attacking g3 pawn.
10. **g8g5**: Rook to g5, attacking g3 pawn.
11. **g8g4**: Rook to g4, attacking g3 pawn.
12. **g8g3**: Rook to g3, but that's not legal as g3 is occupied.
13. **g1h1, g1f1**: King moves, not urgent.
14. **f2g3**: Pawn captures g3, but that's not legal as g3 is occupied by Black.
15. **f2f3**: Pawn to f3, blockading g3 pawn.
16. **a2a3, f2f4, a2a4**: Pawn moves.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's c3 and g3 pawns are dangerous.
- White's rook can attack c3 or d6.
- f2-f3 is a strong candidate to blockade g3.

**Analysis:**

- **Rook to d8 (g8d8):** Attacks d6 pawn, but Black can play c2, threatening c1=Q. After Rxd6, c2, Rc6+ Kd7, Rxc2, White wins the pawn race.
- **Rook to c8 (g8c8):** Attacks c3 pawn directly. If c2, then Rxc2+ Kb6, fxg3, White is up a rook.
- **f2-f3:** Blockades g3, but allows c2, and Black's pawns are still dangerous.

**Calculation:**

1. **g8c8** (Rook to c8)
   - If c2, Rxc2+ Kb6, fxg3, White is up a rook and can mop up.
   - If d6-d5, then Rxc3+ Kb6, fxg3, White is up a rook.

2. **g8d8** (Rook to d8)
   - If c2, Rxd6 c1=Q+ Kh2, Qxc2, White is up a rook for a queen, but Black has perpetual check chances.
   - If d6-d5, Rxd5 c2, Rc5+ Kb6, Rxc2, White is up a rook.

3. **f2-f3**
   - If c2, Rxc2+ Kb6, fxg3, White is up a rook.

**Best move:**
- **g8c8** attacks c3 directly and threatens to win the pawn. If Black pushes c2, Rxc2+ wins the pawn and keeps everything under control.

**Final move:**
```
g8c8

2025-06-22 00:04:25,506 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.14s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (c8), 5 pawns (a2, c2, d5, f2, g1), King (g1)
- Black: King (b7), 3 pawns (c3, d6, g3)

**Key points:**
- White's rook is very active on the 8th rank.
- Black's king is cut off on the queenside.
- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on c3, but it's currently blockaded.
- White's d5 pawn is strong and can advance.
- White's king is safe, and Black's pawns are not immediately threatening.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c8c3: Rook takes the dangerous c3 pawn.
2. c8c7+: Check, but Black just moves the king.
3. f2g3: Recaptures the pawn on g3, but c3 is more urgent.
4. a2a4: Not urgent.
5. f2f3/f4: Not urgent.

**Critical analysis:**
- The c3 pawn is the most dangerous asset for Black. If we take it, we eliminate Black's main counterplay.
- After c8c3, Black cannot immediately create threats. White will be up a full rook for two pawns and can mop up the rest.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the c3 pawn.

2025-06-22 00:04:32,598 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.00s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (c3), pawns on a2, c2, d5, f2, g1, g3, King on g1
- Black: King on a8, pawns on d6, g3

**Key points:**
- Black's king is stuck on a8, boxed in by its own pawn on d6 and White's rook.
- White's king is safe.
- White has a passed pawn on d5.
- Black's only hope is the g3 pawn, but White can easily stop it.
- White's rook is extremely powerful on the third rank.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c3c8: Rook to c8, cutting off the king and threatening to invade.
2. c3c7: Rook to c7, attacking d6 pawn.
3. c3c6: Rook to c6, attacking d6 pawn.
4. c3c5: Rook to c5, attacking d6 pawn.
5. c3c4: Rook to c4, preparing to attack d6.
6. c3g3: Rook takes g3, eliminating Black's only counterplay.
7. f2g3: Pawn takes g3, also eliminates Black's counterplay.
8. f2f3/f2f4: Pushing f-pawn, but not urgent.
9. a2a3/a2a4: Pushing a-pawn, not urgent.

**Critical analysis:**
- The only danger for White is the g3 pawn. If Black gets a queen, things could get tricky.
- Rook takes g3 (c3g3) or pawn takes g3 (f2g3) both eliminate this threat.
- Rook takes g3 is immediate and keeps the rook active, but pawn takes g3 is also safe and keeps the rook on the c-file, which is useful for supporting the d-pawn and cutting off the king.

**Which is better: c3g3 or f2g3?**
- c3g3: Rook is active, but leaves the c-file.
- f2g3: Rook stays on c3, keeps control of c-file, and Black has no counterplay.

After f2g3, White can double up on the c-file, push d5, and win easily.

**Conclusion:**
The safest and most effective move is to capture the g3 pawn with the f-pawn, eliminating all Black counterplay and keeping the rook on the c-file to support the d-pawn's advance.

My move:
```
f2g3
```

2025-06-22 00:04:38,179 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.89s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on g1, rook on c3, pawns on a2, c2, d5, g3, g4
Black: King on a7, pawn on d6

Material: White is up a rook for a pawn. Black's king is on the edge, and White's rook is very active. White's king is safe, and White has a passed d-pawn and a majority on the kingside.

Immediate threats: No immediate mate, but White can press with the rook and push pawns.

Candidate moves:
- c3c6: Attacks the d6 pawn, threatens to win it.
- c3c7: Cuts off the king, but doesn't attack anything directly.
- c3c8: Cuts off the king even more, but doesn't attack anything.
- g3g4: Pushes a pawn, but not urgent.
- a2a4: Pushes a pawn, but not urgent.
- c3f3: Brings rook to kingside, but not needed.

Best plan: Win the d6 pawn, then push passed pawns. Rook to c6 attacks d6, and Black can't defend it. After winning d6, White will have a rook and 5 pawns vs king, which is easily winning.

Let's check for any tricks: After c3c6, Black can't defend d6. If d6d5, then exd5 and White has two connected passed pawns.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c3c6
```

2025-06-22 00:04:45,166 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.28s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (g1), Rook (c6), Pawns (a2, c2, d5, g3, g4, g5)
- Black: King (b8), Pawn (b7)

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black has no immediate threats. The b7 pawn is blockaded.
- White's rook is very active, and White has a passed d-pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c6c8+**: Rook check. Black king must go to a7 or a8.
2. **c6c7**: Rook to c7, attacking b7 pawn.
3. **c6d6**: Rook centralizes, but less active than c7 or c8.
4. **c6b6**: Rook attacks b7 pawn directly.
5. **c6a6**: Rook to a6, but not threatening much.
6. **c6c5**: Rook behind the d-pawn, supports push.
7. **c6c4/c3**: Not as relevant.
8. **Pawn moves**: a2-a3, c2-c3, g3-g4, etc. Not urgent.

**Analysis of top candidate moves:**

- **c6c8+**: 
    - If ...Ka7, then Rc7 attacks b7, and the king is cut off.
    - If ...Ka8, then Rc7 also attacks b7.
    - After Rc7, White threatens to win the b7 pawn.
    - Black cannot defend b7 with the king.
    - After winning b7, White's d-pawn will be unstoppable.

- **c6c7**: 
    - Directly attacks b7, but does not check the king. Black can play ...Ka8, but then White can take b7.

- **c6b6**: 
    - Attacks b7, but the rook is less active than on the 7th or 8th rank.

**Conclusion:**
- **c6c8+** is the most forcing move, driving the king to the edge and then following up with Rc7 to win the b7 pawn. This is the most precise and quickest route to victory.

My move:
```
c6c8

2025-06-22 00:04:52,023 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.46s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (c8), pawns (a2, c2, d5, g3, g2), King (g1)
- Black: King (b7), pawn (d6)

**Position:**
- White is up a rook for a pawn, a decisive material advantage.
- Black's king is on b7, somewhat restricted.
- White's rook is very active on c8.
- White has a passed pawn on d5, which can be supported.
- Black's only pawn is on d6, not dangerous.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c8c6** (attacking d6 pawn)
2. **c8c7+** (check, but king can go to b8 or a6)
3. **c8b8** (cutting off king, but not as effective as c6)
4. **c8d8** (attacking d6 pawn directly)
5. **g3g4** (pushing kingside pawns, but not urgent)
6. **c2c4** (supporting d5 pawn, but not urgent)

**Analysis:**
- The most direct plan is to win the d6 pawn and then push the d-pawn.
- c8c6 attacks the d6 pawn, and Black cannot defend it.
- After c8c6, if Black plays ...Kb8, White can take d6 next move.
- If Black plays ...Ka7, White still takes d6.
- After winning the d6 pawn, White will have a rook and 4 pawns vs king, a trivial win.

**Check for tactics:**
- No immediate checks or threats from Black.
- No stalemate possibilities.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to attack and win the d6 pawn.

```

2025-06-22 00:04:58,887 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.96s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, rook on c6, pawns on a2, c2, d5, g3, g4, h3
- Black: King on a8

**Material:** White has a rook and 6 pawns vs Black's lone king.

**Objective:** The goal is to checkmate Black as efficiently as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Key points:**
- Black's king is on a8, trapped on the edge.
- White's rook on c6 controls the c-file and 6th rank.
- White's king is far from the action, but Black has no counterplay.
- White must avoid stalemating Black by removing all pawn moves or blocking escape squares without being able to checkmate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c6c8** (Rook to c8): This is a check, but after Ka7, White must be careful not to stalemate after further checks.
2. **c6c7** (Rook to c7): Cuts off the 7th rank, but doesn't threaten mate yet.
3. **c6d6** (Rook to d6): Lateral shift, doesn't improve much.
4. **c6b6** (Rook to b6): Prepares to cut off the b-file if king tries to escape.
5. **c6a6** (Rook to a6): Directly threatens mate in one with Ra8#, but Black's king is already on a8.
6. **c6c5** (Rook to c5): Prepares to shepherd the king with the rook.
7. **Pawn moves:** Advancing pawns (a2a3, c2c3, g3g4, etc.) is safe, but doesn't progress toward mate quickly.

**Best plan:** Use the rook to cut off the king and bring the king closer, or advance pawns to restrict Black's king further. Avoid stalemate.

**Immediate threats:** No stalemate yet, as Black's king has a8 and b8 squares (if rook moves off c6).

**Best move:** The most precise is to play **c6c7**, cutting off the 7th rank. This allows the king and pawns to advance, and the rook can swing to the a-file later for mate.

**Final move:**
```
c6c7

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King (g1), Rook (c7), pawns (a2, c2, d5, g3, g2, h3)
- Black: King (b8), pawn (d6)

**White to move.**

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- Black's king is on b8, cut off from the c-file.
- White's rook is very active on c7.
- Black's only pawn is on d6, but it's blockaded and not dangerous.
- White has a massive material advantage (extra rook and pawns).
- No immediate mate, but White can press for a win.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c7c8**: Rook to c8+ checks the king, but after Kb7, the rook is not as active.
2. **c7h7**: Swinging the rook to the h-file, but not immediately threatening.
3. **g3g4**: Pushing the kingside pawns, but no rush.
4. **c2c4**: Expanding on the queenside.
5. **c7c6**: Retreating the rook, not necessary.
6. **c7c5**: Cutting off the king further, but not necessary.
7. **g1f2/h2**: King activation, but not urgent.

**Best plan:**
- The rook is perfectly placed on the 7th rank, cutting off the king.
- The most direct way to win is to activate the king and push pawns.
- However, before activating the king, let's see if we can make progress with pawn moves.

**Critical consideration:**
- Black has no counterplay. The only pawn is d6, which is blockaded.
- White can play c2c4, supporting d5 and preparing to push c5, or g3g4, starting a kingside pawn march.

**Which pawn push is better?**
- c2c4 is safe and supports the center, also gives the king a path via c3/d4.
- g3g4 is also good, but the king is far from the queenside.

**Conclusion:**
- c2c4 is a safe, strong move, supporting d5 and preparing to bring the king to the center.

**Final move:**
```
c2c4

2025-06-22 00:05:11,732 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.60s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King on g1, rook on c7, pawns on a2, c4, d5, g3, g2  
- Black: King on a8, pawn on d6

**Position:**  
- Black's king is cornered on a8.
- White's rook is very active on c7, controlling the 7th rank.
- White has a passed pawn on d5, supported by c4.
- Black's only pawn is on d6, blockaded and not dangerous.
- White's king is safe and can join the action if needed.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can play Rc8#, which is checkmate, as the Black king has no escape squares and nothing can block or capture the rook.

**Double-check:**  
- Is Rc8# legal? Yes, the rook moves from c7 to c8, delivering checkmate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c7c8
```

2025-06-22 00:05:17,600 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.13s):
Let's analyze the position:

White:
- King on g1
- Rook on c8
- Pawns: a2, c4, d5, g3, g2
Black:
- King on a7
- Pawn on d6

Material: White is up a rook for a pawn. White's king is safe, and Black's king is on the edge. White has a passed d-pawn and a rook on the 8th rank, which is very powerful.

Immediate candidate moves:
1. c8c7/c8c6: Rook drops back, but this is passive and unnecessary.
2. c8h8/c8g8/c8f8/c8e8/c8d8: Swinging the rook to the kingside or centralizing.
3. c8b8/c8a8: Rook to b8/a8, but Black's king is on a7, so this is not effective.
4. c4c5: Advance the c-pawn, supporting d5 and restricting Black's king.
5. g3g4: Advance kingside pawns, but not urgent.
6. a2a3/a2a4: Advance a-pawn, but not urgent.

Tactical considerations:
- Black's king is cut off on the a-file and 7th/8th ranks.
- Advancing the c-pawn (c4c5) supports d5 and restricts Black's king further.
- Rook can swing to the kingside to help promote pawns or cut off the king further.
- No immediate threats from Black.

Best plan:
- Advance the queenside pawns to create a passed pawn, while keeping the rook active.
- c4c5 is strong: it supports d5, restricts Black's king, and prepares to push d6-d7-d8=Q.
- Rook can always swing to the kingside if needed.

Final move:
```
c4c5
```

2025-06-22 00:05:22,450 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook on c8, pawns on d5, a2, g3, g2, King on g1
- Black: King on a7, pawn on c5

**Position:**
- White is up a rook for a pawn, with several pawns left.
- Black's king is on the edge (a7), and White's rook is very active.
- White's d5 pawn is advanced and can be supported.
- Black's only pawn is on c5, not immediately threatening.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c8xc5**: Rook captures the c5 pawn, eliminating Black's last pawn. This is very strong, as it removes any counterplay and leaves White with a rook and four pawns vs. king.
2. **d5d6**: Advance the passed pawn, but Black can just take it with the king.
3. **g3g4**: Advance kingside pawns, but not urgent.
4. **a2a4**: Advance queenside pawn, but not urgent.
5. **King moves**: Not urgent.

**Best move:**
- Capturing the c5 pawn with the rook is the most precise. It removes Black's only hope for counterplay and makes the win trivial.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c8c5
```

2025-06-22 00:05:27,399 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.28s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1k6/8/8/2RP4/8/6P1/P5P1/6K1 w - - 1 65

**White:** King g1, Rook c5, Pawn d5, g3, a2, g2  
**Black:** King b8

White is completely winning. Black's king is cut off on the b-file, and White has a rook and multiple pawns. The best plan is to press for a swift checkmate or force Black's king to the edge and deliver mate.

Let's consider the candidate moves:

1. **c5c8**: Rook to c8, cutting off the king on the 8th rank. This is a classic technique to box in the king for a rook and king mate.
2. **d5d6**: Advancing the pawn, but it doesn't threaten anything immediate.
3. **g3g4**: Advancing the kingside pawns, but not urgent.
4. **a2a3/a2a4**: Not urgent.

**c5c8** is the most forcing move, as it restricts the Black king to the 8th rank, making it easier to deliver mate. From there, White can bring the king up and use the rook to deliver mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c5c8
```

2025-06-22 00:05:32,718 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.51s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2R5/k7/8/3P4/8/6P1/P5P1/6K1 w - - 3 66

White: King on g1, rook on c8, pawns on a2, d5, g3, g2  
Black: King on a7

White is completely winning. The Black king is cut off on the a-file, and White has a rook and four pawns versus a lone king. The only thing to watch out for is stalemate tricks.

**Candidate moves:**
- c8c7: Bring the rook closer to support pawn promotion.
- d5d6: Advance the passed pawn.
- a2a4: Advance the a-pawn.
- g3g4: Advance the kingside pawns.
- g1h2: Activate the king.

**Key considerations:**
- Avoid stalemating the Black king.
- Convert the material advantage efficiently.
- Support pawn promotion.

**Analysis:**
- d5d6: Pushes the passed pawn. Black has no way to stop it, but after d6, Black is not stalemated (can move Ka8).
- c8c7: Prepares to support the d-pawn, but not strictly necessary yet.
- a2a4: Starts pushing the a-pawn, but the d-pawn is closer to promotion.
- g3g4: Not urgent; queenside is more important.
- King moves: Not urgent.

**Best move:**
Pushing the d-pawn is the most direct and forces Black to the edge, with no stalemate risk.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d5d6
```

2025-06-22 00:05:37,982 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.69s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (c8), Pawn (d6, g3, a2, g2), King (g1)
- Black: King (b6)

**Position:**
- White has a rook on c8, a pawn on d6 (very advanced), and the Black king is on b6.
- White's d6 pawn is one step from promotion and is supported by the rook on the c-file.
- Black's king is cut off from the d-file by the rook on c8.
- White's king is on g1, far from the action, but Black has no pawns and cannot create counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d6d7 — Advance the pawn, threatening to promote.
2. c8c7 — Support the pawn from behind.
3. c8b8 — Cut off the Black king further.
4. g3g4 — Advance kingside pawns, but not urgent.
5. a2a4 — Advance queenside pawn, but not urgent.

**Analysis:**
- d6d7 is the most direct. After d7, the pawn is one step from promotion.
- Black's king cannot reach the d-file to stop the pawn.
- If Black tries Kb7, then d8=Q is unstoppable, since the rook covers the promotion square.
- There is no way for Black to stop the pawn from promoting.

**Conclusion:**
- d6d7 is the most direct and decisive move, threatening d8=Q next move.

My move:
```
d6d7

2025-06-22 00:05:46,892 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.39s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Rook (c8), pawn (d7), pawns (a2, g3, g2), King (g1)
- Black: King (a6)

**White to move.**

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The pawn on d7 is one step from promotion. Black's king is far away and cannot stop it.
- Promoting to a queen on d8 is possible.
- Promoting to a rook, bishop, or knight is also possible, but queen is almost always best unless stalemate is a concern.

**Stalemate check:**
- If we play d7-d8=Q, Black's king is on a6 and has squares a5, b5, b6, b7, a7, b8, a8, but let's check if any are available:
  - a6: occupied by Black king
  - a5: off the board
  - b5: off the board
  - b6: off the board
  - b7: off the board
  - a7: off the board
  - b8: off the board
  - a8: off the board

Wait, let's check the board:

- The only Black piece is the king on a6.
- All other squares around a6 are off the board, so after d7-d8=Q, does Black have any legal moves? Let's see:
  - a6: occupied
  - b6: off the board
  - b7: off the board
  - a7: off the board
  - b5: off the board
  - a5: off the board

So, after d7-d8=Q, Black's king is on a6 and has no legal moves. Is Black in check? Let's see:
- The new queen is on d8, not attacking a6 directly.
- The rook is on c8, not attacking a6.
- No other White piece attacks a6.

So, after d7-d8=Q, Black is not in check, but has no legal moves. That is stalemate.

**Alternative moves:**
- Don't promote immediately. Instead, improve position.
- Move the rook somewhere? But the rook is not needed to stop the king.
- Move the king? Not necessary.
- Push another pawn? Not urgent.

**Best move:**
- Let's try to avoid stalemate. Instead of promoting to a queen, promote to a rook or bishop or knight.

- d7-d8=N: Black king is on a6, still no legal moves, still stalemate.
- d7-d8=B: Bishop on d8, still no check, still stalemate.
- d7-d8=R: Rook on d8, still no check, still stalemate.

So, all promotions result in stalemate.

**Alternative plan:**
- Don't promote yet. Play a waiting move, such as a2-a3 or g3-g4, to give Black a move.

If we play a2-a3:
- Black still cannot move, but it's White's move again.

But after a2-a3, it's still White's move, so Black is not forced to move.

Wait, but after a2-a3, it's Black's move, but Black still has no legal moves, so it's stalemate.

Wait, but it's not stalemate until White promotes.

Wait, let's check: If White plays a2-a3, Black still has no legal moves, so it's stalemate.

No, it's not stalemate until White promotes. The game continues.

So, the best move is to play a waiting move, such as a2-a3, to avoid immediate stalemate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
a2a3
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (c8), Pawn (d7), Pawn (a3), Pawn (g3), Pawn (g2), King (g1)
- Black: King (a7)

**White to move.**

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The d7 pawn is one square from promotion. Black's king is on a7, unable to stop the pawn.
- Promoting the pawn is possible. Let's check if there are any stalemate tricks.

**Stalemate check:**
- If White plays d7-d8=Q (or any piece), Black's king is on a7 and has a3 as a possible escape square (since White's pawn is on a3, not a4).
- Black's king can move to a6 or a8 if the rook moves, but currently, the rook is on c8, so after promotion, Black's king will have a6 and a8 as escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d7-d8=Q (promote to queen)
2. d7-d8=R (promote to rook)
3. d7-d8=B (promote to bishop)
4. d7-d8=N (promote to knight)
5. Rook moves (not necessary, as promotion is available)
6. King moves (not necessary)
7. Pawn moves (not urgent)

**Best move:**
- Promoting to a queen is the most direct and winning. There is no stalemate, as Black's king can move to a6 or a8 after promotion.

2025-06-22 00:05:59,254 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.09s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on g1, Queen on d8, Rook on c8, pawns on a3, g3, g2.
- Black: King on a6.

Material: White is up a queen and rook, Black has only a king. White is completely winning.

Objective: Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

Key points:
- Black king is on a6, with escape squares a7, b7, b6, b5, a5, but most are covered or can be covered.
- Avoid stalemating the Black king (i.e., do not block all its moves unless it's checkmate).

Candidate moves:
1. d8a8+ (Queen to a8, check): Black king must move to b6.
2. c8a8+ (Rook to a8, check): Black king must move to b6.
3. d8d6 (Queen to d6): threatens Qa6# next move, but not check.
4. d8d5 (Queen to d5): threatens Qa5# next move, but not check.
5. d8d4 (Queen to d4): threatens Qa4# next move, but not check.
6. d8a5 (Queen to a5): threatens mate on a6, but not check.
7. d8b6 (Queen takes b6): check, but not mate, and not optimal.

Let's check the fastest mate:

If 1. d8a8+ Ka5 (only move), then 2. Rc5# is mate.
But after 1. d8a8+ Ka5, Rc5 is not legal (rook is on c8).

Alternatively, let's try:
1. d8a8+ Kb6 (only move)
2. Qb8+ Ka5 (only move)
3. Qb4# (mate)

Let's check if this is legal:
- 1. d8a8+ Kb6
- 2. Qb8+ Ka5
- 3. Qb4#

Yes, this is mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d8a8
```

2025-06-22 00:06:04,418 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.16s):
Thank you for pointing out the error. Let's carefully review the legal moves and the position:

White: King g1, Queen d8, Rook c8, pawns a3, g3, g2  
Black: King a6

Legal moves (subset relevant for mate):  
- Queen moves: d8h8, d8g8, d8f8, d8e8, d8e7, d8d7, d8c7, d8f6, d8d6, d8b6, d8g5, d8d5, d8a5, d8h4, d8d4, d8d3, d8d2, d8d1  
- Rook moves: c8b8, c8a8, c8c7, c8c6, c8c5, c8c4, c8c3, c8c2, c8c1  
- King moves: g1h2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1  
- Pawn moves: g3g4, a3a4

Let’s look for the fastest mate or a move that restricts the Black king further.

**Candidate move: d8a5**  
- Queen to a5. This puts the Black king in a mating net:  
  - If Ka7, then Rc7#  
  - If Kb7, then Rc7#  
  - If Kb6, then Qb6#  
  - If Ka5, then Rc5#  
But let's check if these squares are available.

After Qd8a5:
- Black king is on a6. Legal moves: a7, b7, b6, b5, a5.
- a7 is not available (pawn blocks).
- b7 is available.
- b6 is available.
- b5 is available.
- a5 is available.

If Kb7, then Rc7# is mate.
If Kb6, then Qb6# is mate.
If Ka5, then Rc5# is mate.

So, Qd8a5 is a forcing move that leads to mate next move, regardless of what Black plays.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d8a5
```

2025-06-22 00:06:08,393 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.39s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on g1, rook on c8, queen on a5, pawns on a3, g3, g2  
Black: King on b7

Material: White is up a queen and a rook for a lone king.  
Objective: Checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

Immediate checks:
- Qa8+ (a5a8): King must go to b6.
- Qb5+ (a5b5): King must go to a7.
- Qd5+ (a5d5): King must go to a6.
- Qb4+ (a5b4): King must go to a6.
- Qd2+ (a5d2): King must go to b8.

But let's look for forced mate.

Qa8+ (a5a8) forces Kb6. Then Rc6# is mate.

So, the fastest mate is:
1. Qa8+ Kb6
2. Rc6#

Therefore, the move is:
```
a5a8
```

2025-06-22 00:06:16,357 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.50s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** Q1R5/8/1k6/8/8/P5P1/6P1/6K1 w - - 5 72

**White:** Qa8, Rc8, Kg1, Pa3, Pg3, Pg2  
**Black:** Kb6

White is up a queen and a rook, with three pawns against a lone king. This is a trivially won position for White, but let's look for the fastest mate or a way to restrict the Black king.

**Immediate threats:**
- The Black king is on b6, with no other Black pieces.
- White's queen and rook are both very active.
- The queen on a8 controls the a-file and the 8th rank.
- The rook on c8 controls the c-file and the 8th rank.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa5+** (a8a5): Forces the king to a7 or b7.
2. **Rb8+** (c8b8): Forces the king to a7 or c7.
3. **Qc6+** (a8c6): Forces the king to a7 or b7.
4. **Rc6+** (c8c6): Forces the king to a7 or b7.
5. **a4**: Not urgent; pawn push doesn't threaten mate.
6. **g4**: Not urgent.

Let's check for mate in one:

- **Qa5+**: King can go to b7 or a7.
- **Rb8+**: King can go to a7 or c7.
- **Qc6+**: King can go to a7 or b7.
- **Rc6+**: King can go to a7 or b7.

Is there a mate in one? Let's check:

- **Qa5+**: If Kxa5, not possible. If Kb7, then Qb7# next move.
- **Rb8+**: If Kc7, Rb7# is mate. If Ka7, Qb7# is mate.

Wait, let's check **Rb8+**:

1. Rb8+ Kc7 (only move), then Rb7# is mate.

So, **Rb8+** is the fastest way to force mate in two, but not mate in one.

Is there a mate in one? Let's check **Qa5+**:

- Qa5+ Kb7 (only move), Qb7#.

So, **Qa5+** is also mate in two.

Is there a mate in one with the rook? **Rc6+**:

- Rc6+ Kb7 (only move), Qc8#.

So, all these lines are mate in two.

Is there a mate in one? Let's check all queen moves:

- Qb7#: Not possible, king is on b6.
- Qc6+: Not mate, king can move.
- Qb8+: Not mate, king can move.
- Qc8: Not mate, king can move.

All right, so there is no mate in one, but mate in two is forced.

Which move is the most forcing? **Rb8+** is very forcing and restricts the king to only two squares.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c8b8
```

2025-06-22 00:06:21,937 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.98s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (a8), Rook (b8), 2 pawns (a3, g3), King (g1)  
- Black: King (c5), 2 pawns (g2, g3)

**Black's king is on c5, with no immediate threats. White's queen and rook are very active and can coordinate for a mating net. White's king is safe.**

**Candidate moves:**
- Queen moves: a8 to b7, a7, c6, d5, e4, f3 (all check), or a4.
- Rook moves: b8 to h8, g8, f8, e8, d8, c8, b7, b6, b5, b4, b3, b2, b1.
- Pawn moves: a3a4, g3g4.
- King moves: g1h2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1.

**Immediate checks:**
- a8c6+ (queen check)
- a8d5+ (queen check)
- a8e4+ (queen check)
- a8f3+ (queen check)

**Let's check the most forcing moves:**
- a8c6+ forces the king to b6 or d4.
- a8d5+ forces the king to b6 or d4.
- a8e4+ forces the king to b6 or d4.
- a8f3+ forces the king to b6 or d4.

But let's see if we can trap the king or force mate.

**Let's try a8c6+:**
- If Kd4, then Rb4# is mate.
- If Kb6, then Qb6# is mate.

So, after a8c6+:
- Kd4 Rb4# (mate)
- Kb6 Qb6# (mate)

**Therefore, a8c6+ is a forced mate in 1 or 2.**

So the best move is:
```

2025-06-22 00:06:27,356 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.68s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Rook (b8), Queen (c6), 3 pawns (a3, g3, g2), King (g1)
- Black: King (d4)

**Position:**  
- Black's king is exposed on d4, with no pieces to defend.
- White's queen and rook are very active and can coordinate for a quick mate.
- White's king is safe.
- White has several pawns, but the focus is on the mating net.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can try to deliver mate or force the Black king into a mating net.
- Let's check for immediate mates:

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe4#** (c6e4): Queen moves to e4, checkmate. The Black king on d4 cannot move to c5, c4, c3, e3, e4, e5, or d5, as all are covered by the queen or rook.
2. **Rb4+** (b8b4): Rook moves to b4, check, but the king can escape to e3.
3. **Qc4+** (c6c4): Queen moves to c4, check, but king can go to e3.

**Checkmate verification for Qe4#:**
- King on d4, Queen on e4:  
  - c5: covered by queen
  - c4: covered by queen
  - c3: covered by queen
  - d3: covered by queen
  - e3: covered by queen
  - e4: occupied by queen
  - e5: covered by queen
  - d5: covered by queen

All escape squares are covered. This is checkmate.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to deliver checkmate immediately.

2025-06-22 00:06:32,675 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.50s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook on b8, pawns on a3, g3, g2, King on g1
- Black: King on e4

**Position:**
- White is up a rook and three pawns vs. a lone king. This is a trivially won endgame for White, but must be played carefully to avoid stalemate.

**Immediate plan:**
- The Black king is centralized on e4. White's rook is on b8, ready to cut off the king.
- Advancing pawns is possible, but first, let's see if we can cut the king off further or force it back.

**Candidate moves:**
1. b8b4+ — Check, forcing the king to move.
2. b8e8+ — Check, but the king can move to d3 or f3.
3. b8b7 — No immediate threat, but prepares to support pawn advance.
4. a3a4 — Advance the pawn.
5. g3g4 — Advance the pawn.

**Analysis:**
- b8b4+ is a forcing move. After Kd4 or Kf3, the king is pushed away from the center.
- Advancing pawns is safe, but not urgent. The Black king is not threatening anything.
- Rook moves along the 8th rank don't do much.

**Best move:**
- b8b4+ is the most forcing and keeps the king cut off from the queenside, making it easier to shepherd the pawns.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b8b4
```

2025-06-22 00:06:39,673 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.14s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/8/3k4/1R6/P5P1/6P1/6K1 w - - 2 76

**White:** King on g1, rook on b4, pawns on a3, g3, g2  
**Black:** King on d5

**Legal moves:**  
b4b8, b4b7, b4b6, b4b5, b4h4, b4g4, b4f4, b4e4, b4d4, b4c4, b4a4, b4b3, b4b2, b4b1, g1h2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1, g3g4, a3a4

**Position assessment:**  
White is up a rook and has three pawns vs. Black's lone king. This is a trivially won position for White, but the goal is to win as efficiently as possible, avoiding stalemates and unnecessary checks.

**Candidate moves:**
- Advance the a-pawn (a3-a4) to create a passed pawn.
- Advance the g-pawn (g3-g4) for the same reason.
- Move the rook to cut off the black king further (e.g., b4-b8, b4-b7, b4-b6, etc.).
- Move the rook laterally to prepare for king activation or to support pawn advances.

**Key strategic idea:**  
Cutting the black king off from the queenside and supporting pawn advances is optimal. The black king is currently on d5, so keeping it cut off from the queenside is good. The rook on b4 already does this.

**Immediate threats:**  
No immediate threats from Black. White can proceed with pawn advances or king activation.

**Best plan:**  
- Advance the a-pawn (a3-a4) to create a passed pawn, which will force the black king to stay on the kingside, making it easier to promote.
- Alternatively, rook moves like b4-b8 or b4-b7 are fine, but not necessary yet.

**Check for stalemate:**  
No risk of stalemate with a4.

**Final move:**

2025-06-22 00:06:45,350 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.80s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/2k5/8/PR6/6P1/6P1/6K1 w - - 1 77

**White:** King on g1, Rook on b4, Pawn on a4, g3, g2  
**Black:** King on c6

**Legal moves:**  
b4b8, b4b7, b4b6, b4b5, b4h4, b4g4, b4f4, b4e4, b4d4, b4c4, b4b3, b4b2, b4b1, g1h2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1, a4a5, g3g4

**Assessment:**
- White is up a rook and two pawns, with a clear path to victory.
- Black's king is cut off from the queenside and the pawns.
- The plan is to advance the a-pawn, supported by the rook, and use the king if necessary.
- The only thing to avoid is stalemate or allowing the Black king to get active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a4a5: Advance the a-pawn immediately.
2. b4b8: Cut the Black king off further, but it's already cut off from the a-file.
3. b4b5: Check, but the king just moves to d6 or c7.
4. g3g4: Advance the kingside pawns, but the queenside plan is faster.

**Best move:**
- a4a5 is the most direct and logical. It threatens to push a6 next, and the Black king cannot approach the pawn.

**Double-check for stalemate:**
- After a4a5, Black still has moves (king can go to d6, d7, c7, etc.), so no stalemate risk.

**Final move:**
```
a4a5
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/8/P2k4/1R6/6P1/6P1/6K1 w - - 1 78

**White:** King on g1, rook on b4, pawns on a5, g3, g2  
**Black:** King on d5

**Legal moves:**
- Rook moves: b4b8, b4b7, b4b6, b4b5, b4h4, b4g4, b4f4, b4e4, b4d4, b4c4, b4a4, b4b3, b4b2, b4b1
- King moves: g1h2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1
- Pawn moves: a5a6, g3g4

**Position evaluation:**
- White is completely winning: up a rook and two pawns, Black has only a king.
- The only thing to watch out for is stalemate or allowing the Black king to escape perpetual checks (not possible here).
- The plan is to advance the a-pawn to queen, using the rook to cut off the Black king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a5a6: Advance the a-pawn. Black king is cut off from the a-file by the rook. After a6, the pawn is two steps from queening.
2. b4b5: Check the Black king, but it just moves to c6 or e6, not necessary.
3. b4b8: Move the rook to the back rank, but not needed.
4. g3g4: Advance the g-pawn, but the a-pawn is closer to queening.
5. King moves: Not urgent.

**Best move:**
- a5a6 is the most direct and effective. The Black king cannot approach the pawn due to the rook on b4. Next, a7 and a8=Q will follow.

**Final move:**
```
a5a6
```

2025-06-22 00:06:57,129 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.10s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (g1), Rook (b4), Pawn (a6, g3, g2)
- Black: King (c6)

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats and goals:**
- White is up a rook and two pawns, with a passed pawn on a6 ready to promote.
- Black's king is cut off from the a-file by the rook on b4.
- White's plan is to promote the a-pawn, but must ensure Black's king cannot approach or harass the rook/pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a6-a7: Pushes the pawn, threatening to promote next move. Black cannot stop promotion.
2. b4-b8: Prepares to support promotion, but not necessary since the pawn is already on a6.
3. Other rook moves: Not necessary, as the rook is already perfectly placed.
4. King moves: Not urgent, as the king is not involved in the action.
5. g3-g4: Not urgent, as the queenside is the focus.

**Analysis:**
- After 1. a7, Black cannot stop a8=Q. The only way to delay is to try to approach with the king, but it's too late.
- After 1. a7 Kc7 2. a8=Q, White wins easily.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the a-pawn.

2025-06-22 00:07:01,394 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.36s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**White:**
- King on g1
- Rook on b4
- Pawn on a7 (about to promote)
- Pawns on g3, g2

**Black:**
- King on d7

It's White to move, and the pawn on a7 can promote. Black's king is too far to stop the a-pawn, and there are no Black pieces to create counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a7a8Q (promote to queen)
2. a7a8R (promote to rook)
3. a7a8B (promote to bishop)
4. a7a8N (promote to knight)
5. Other rook moves (not urgent)
6. King moves (not urgent)
7. g3g4 (not urgent)

**Analysis:**
- Promoting to a queen is the most straightforward and powerful. Black has no checks, no pawns, and no pieces. After a7a8Q, White will have a queen and rook versus a lone king, which is trivially winning.
- Underpromotion is unnecessary; queen is best.

**Conclusion:** Promote the pawn to a queen.

2025-06-22 00:07:06,572 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.56s):
Let's analyze the position:

White:
- Queen on a8
- Rook on b4
- King on g1
- Pawns on g3, g2

Black:
- King on e7

It's White to move. Black's king is on e7, and White's queen and rook are very active. The Black king is cut off from the f-file and is exposed.

Let's look for forced mates or decisive material gain.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qa8e8+ (forces the king to f6 or d6, but both squares are covered by the queen and rook)
2. Qa8b7+ (forces the king to f8 or d8, but both are not possible)
3. Qa8a7 (no check, but threatens mate)
4. Rb4e4+ (forces the king to f6 or d6, but both are covered)
5. Rb4b7+ (forces the king to f8 or d8, but both are not possible)

Let's check Qa8e8+:
- ...Kxe8 is not possible (queen is not protected)
- ...Kf6 is not possible (rook covers f6)
- ...Kd6 is not possible (rook covers d6)
- ...Kd8 is not possible (queen covers d8)
- ...Kf7 is not possible (queen covers f7)
- ...Kf8 is not possible (queen covers f8)
- ...Kd7 is not possible (queen covers d7)

Wait, after Qa8e8+, the only legal move for Black is Kd6, but the rook on b4 covers d6. So it's checkmate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
a8e8
```

2025-06-22 00:07:14,146 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.81s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on g1, Queen on e8, Rook on b4, pawns on g3, g2  
Black: King on f6

It's White to move. Black's king is on f6, and White's queen is on e8, cutting off the 8th rank. The rook on b4 can cut off the 4th rank or swing to other files. The king is far from the action, but Black has no pieces except the king.

Goal: Checkmate the Black king as quickly and safely as possible, avoiding stalemate.

Let's examine forcing moves (checks):

1. Qe8-e6+ (queen check on e6)
   - Black king can only go to g5 or g7 (f7 is covered by queen, e7 by queen, e6 is occupied, f5 is covered by queen, e5 is covered by queen, f6 is occupied).
   - But after Qe6+, K moves to g5 or g7.

2. Qe8-g6+ (queen check on g6)
   - Black king can only go to e7 or e5 (f7 is covered, f6 is occupied, g5 is covered by queen, g7 is covered by queen, f5 is covered by queen).
   - After Qg6+, K moves to e7 or e5.

3. Qe8-f7+ (queen check on f7)
   - Black king can only go to g5 or g7.

4. Rb4-f4+ (rook check on f4)
   - Black king can only go to g5 or e6.

But let's look for the fastest mate.

If Qe8-e6+ and Kf6-g5, then Qe6-g6 is mate (since the king is on g5, and all escape squares are covered).

Let's check that:

1. Qe6+ Kg5
2. Qg6#

Is this mate?
- King on g5, queen on g6, rook on b4, king on g1, pawns on g2, g3.
- Queen covers f5, h5, h6, h4, g5, g4, f6, f7, g7, h7.
- King cannot go to h5 (covered by queen), f5 (covered by queen), f6 (covered by queen), h4 (covered by queen), g4 (covered by queen), f4 (covered by rook), h6 (covered by queen), g6 (occupied), f7 (covered by queen), g7 (covered by queen), h7 (covered by queen).

Yes, Qg6# is mate.

Therefore, the fastest forced mate is:

1. Qe8-e6+ Kg5
2. Qg6#

So, the best move is:
```
e8e6
```

2025-06-22 00:07:19,578 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.26s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, rook on b4, pawns on g3 and g2.
- Black: King on e6.

**Material:** White has a rook and two pawns vs. Black's lone king.

**Objective:** Convert to a win with minimal risk. The standard technique is to use the rook and king to box in the enemy king, then advance the pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b4b6**: Cuts off the Black king from the 6th rank, restricting its movement.
2. **b4b7**: Similar, but the king can still access f6 and e6.
3. **b4b8**: Puts the rook on the back rank, but doesn't restrict the king as much.
4. **g3g4**: Starts advancing the pawn, but the king is not cut off and could approach.
5. **King moves**: Not urgent; the king is far from the action.

**Best plan:** Cut the Black king off from the 6th rank, then bring the king up and push pawns.

**Move selection:**
- **b4b6** is the most precise. It restricts the Black king to the 7th and 8th ranks, making it easier to bring the White king up and promote a pawn.

**Final move:**
```
b4b6
```

2025-06-22 00:07:26,677 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.83s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, rook on b6, pawns on g3, g2
- Black: King on e5

**Material:** White has a rook and two pawns, Black only has a king.

**Objective:** Convert this overwhelming material advantage into a win. The key is to avoid stalemate and steadily drive the black king to the edge, then deliver mate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rook moves: b6b8, b6b7, b6h6, b6g6, b6f6, b6e6, b6d6, b6c6, b6a6, b6b5, b6b4, b6b3, b6b2, b6b1
- King moves: g1h2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1
- Pawn move: g3g4

**Analysis:**
- Rook moves along the 6th rank (b6h6, b6g6, etc.) cut the king off from the f-file and push him to the edge.
- Rook to b8 or b7 doesn't help much.
- Rook to b5 checks the king, but he can move to f6 or d6.
- Rook to b4, b3, etc., are slow and unnecessary.
- King moves are slow; the king is far from the action.
- Pawn move g3g4 is safe, but not urgent.

**Best plan:** Use the rook to cut the king off and restrict his movement. The most effective is to play b6h6, cutting the king off from the f-file and forcing him toward the edge.

**Double-check:** Is there any stalemate risk? No, Black's king has plenty of moves.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play the rook to h6.

```
b6h6

2025-06-22 00:07:32,681 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.04s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, rook on h6, pawns on g3 and g2.
- Black: King on d4.

**Material:** White is up a rook and two pawns vs. a lone king.

**Objective:** Convert this overwhelming advantage to a win, ideally as quickly and safely as possible.

**Immediate threats:** None from Black; Black's king is far from the pawns and cannot threaten anything.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h6h4** (cutting off the king further, preparing to push pawns)
2. **g3g4** (start pushing pawns)
3. **h6d6** (cutting off the king from the 6th rank)
4. **h6h7** (preparing to support pawn pushes)
5. **g1f2** (bring king closer)
6. **h6h8** (not useful, rook is already optimal)
7. **h6g6** (rook on g6, but not necessary)

**Analysis:**
- The Black king is on d4. The main plan is to cut off the king and push pawns.
- Rook on h6 is already cutting off the 6th rank.
- Moving the rook to d6 (h6d6) would cut off the king from advancing to the 5th rank, but the king is already on d4.
- Pushing g4 is safe and starts the process of queening.
- Moving the king closer (g1f2) is also a standard technique in rook and pawn endgames.

**Best move:**
- **g3g4** is the most direct way to win. The Black king cannot approach the pawns, and White can support the pawn advance with the king or rook as needed.

Therefore, the best move is:
```

2025-06-22 00:07:39,639 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.89s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, rook on h6, pawns on g2, g4
- Black: King on d5

**White to move.**

**Immediate assessment:**
- White is up a rook and two pawns vs. lone king.
- Black king is centralized, but White's rook is active and can cut off the king.
- White's king is far, but with two connected passed pawns and a rook, this is a trivially won endgame with correct play.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h6h5** (Rook cuts off the king from the 5th rank, preparing to push pawns)
2. **h6h8** (Rook to back rank, but doesn't help much)
3. **g4g5** (Start pushing pawns, but king is not cut off yet)
4. **h6h7** (Rook to 7th, but not as effective as h5)
5. **g2g3** (Prepares to bring king up, but not urgent)

**Analysis:**
- The most principled technique is to cut the king off from the 5th rank with **h6h5**. This prevents the king from approaching the pawns and allows White to push the g-pawns safely.
- After **h6h5**, if Black tries to approach via c4 or e4, White can push pawns and use the rook to check and support promotion.
- Pushing pawns immediately (g4g5) allows Black king to approach more easily.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to cut off the king with the rook:

```
h6h5
```

2025-06-22 00:07:47,359 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.60s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g1, rook on h5, pawns on g4 and g2
- Black: King on c4
- No Black pawns or pieces

**White to move.**

**Objective:** Win as quickly as possible, avoid stalemate, and ensure Black's king is restricted.

**Analysis:**
- Black's king is on c4, far from the action.
- White's rook is on h5, able to cut off the king.
- White's king is on g1, can approach to help.
- White has two pawns (g4, g2) that can be advanced.
- No immediate mate, but we can press for a win.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h5h8 (Rook to h8): Prepares to swing the rook to the 8th rank, but doesn't restrict the king further.
2. h5h7 (Rook to h7): Similar, not much impact.
3. h5h6 (Rook to h6): No real threat.
4. h5g5 (Rook to g5): Cuts off the king from the d-file, but king is already on c4.
5. h5f5 (Rook to f5): Cuts off the king from the e-file.
6. h5e5 (Rook to e5): Cuts off the king from the f-file.
7. h5d5 (Rook to d5): Cuts off the king from the d-file, restricts king to c4/b4/a4.
8. h5c5 (Rook to c5): Attacks the king, but king can move to d4 or b4.
9. h5b5, h5a5: Not useful.
10. h5h4: Not useful.
11. g4g5: Advance pawn, but doesn't restrict king.
12. g2g3: Advance pawn, but not urgent.
13. King moves: g1h2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1.

**Best plan:** 
- Use the rook to cut off the Black king and then bring the king up to support pawn promotion.
- The move h5d5 is strong: it cuts off the king from the d-file, so Black's king is stuck on c4, b4, a4. Then White can bring the king up and push pawns.

**Check for stalemate:** After h5d5, Black has c4, b4, a4 to move, so no stalemate.

**Final move:**
```
h5d5

2025-06-22 00:07:52,394 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.32s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/8/3k4/6P1/8/6P1/6K1 w - - 0 88

**White:** King on g1, pawns on g2, g4  
**Black:** King on d5

It's White to move. The Black king is centralized, but White has two connected passed pawns on the kingside. The Black king is too far to stop both pawns if White plays accurately.

Let's consider the candidate moves:

1. **g4g5**: Advance the g-pawn. This is the most aggressive move, threatening to push the pawn further and create a passed pawn. The Black king cannot reach the pawns in time.
2. **g2g3**: Solid, but less ambitious. No immediate threat.
3. **King moves (g1h2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1)**: King moves don't help much; the king is already supporting the pawns.

**Calculation after g4g5:**
- If ...Ke4, then g5-g6, and the pawns are unstoppable.
- If ...Ke6, then g5-g6, and again, the pawns are unstoppable.

**Calculation after g2g3:**
- Black can try to approach with the king, but White can always push g4-g5 at the right moment.

**Best move:** Push the pawn immediately to maximize the advantage and force Black to react.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g4g5
```

2025-06-22 00:07:57,957 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.96s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White pawns: g5, g2
- Black king: e6
- White king: g1

It's White to move.

Short-term tactics:
- The g5 pawn is two squares away from promotion, but the Black king is relatively close.
- Advancing the g-pawn (g5-g6) is tempting, but let's check if Black can stop it.
- If 1. g5-g6, Black plays 1... Kf6, and after 2. g7 Kxg7, the pawn is lost.
- If 1. g2-g4, it doesn't help much.
- If 1. g1-h2 or g1-f2, king moves, but the king is far from the action.

Long-term strategy:
- The only way to win is to promote a pawn, but Black's king is well placed to stop the g-pawn.
- Advancing the king is too slow; the Black king will capture the pawns.

Let's check the critical line:
1. g5-g6 Kf6 (only move)
2. g2-g4 (try to create a passed pawn)
   - Black plays Kxg6, and White is left with one pawn, which is easily stopped.

Alternatively, try to bring the king closer:
1. g1-f2 Kf5 (Black approaches)
2. Kf2-e3 Ke5 (Black keeps opposition)
   - White cannot make progress.

So, the only way to try for a win is to push the g-pawn and hope for a mistake, but objectively, it is a draw with best play.

Still, the best move is to push the passed pawn and see if Black errs.

Final move:
```
g5g6

2025-06-22 00:08:05,663 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.99s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on g1, pawns on g6 and g2  
Black: King on f6

It's White to move.

**Short-term tactics:**
- The pawn on g6 is two squares from queening. The Black king is on f6, so it can approach the g7 square.
- If White plays g7, Black can play Kg7 and capture the pawn.
- If White pushes the g2 pawn, Black can approach the g6 pawn.
- King moves: The White king is far from the action, but can start approaching.

**Long-term strategy:**
- White's main chance is to promote one of the pawns.
- Black's king is well-placed to stop the g-pawn, but White has a second pawn on g2.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g6g7: Push the pawn, but Black plays Kg7 and captures it.
2. g2g3: Prepare to advance the second pawn.
3. King moves: g1h2, g1f2, etc. The king is far away, but could try to help.

**Calculation:**
- If 1. g6g7 Kg7 2. g2g3 Kxg6, White is left with only one pawn, which is a draw.
- If 1. g2g3, Black may play Kg7, but then White can try to push g6-g7 and g3-g4-g5, but Black's king is close enough to stop both pawns.

**Best plan:**
- The only way to win is to try to keep both pawns and use them together. If we push g2-g4, Black can play Kg7, and after g6-g7 Kxg7, White has only one pawn.
- If we play a king move, Black will just wait.

**Is there any way to win?**
- No, with best play, Black can always stop both pawns. However, the best practical try is to keep both pawns and advance the king.

**Best move:**
- Advance the king toward the pawns, as pushing the pawns immediately leads to their loss.

Therefore, the best move is to bring the king closer:

Let's analyze the position:

White: King on f2, pawns on g2 and g6  
Black: King on e7

It's White to move.

- The g6 pawn is two squares from promotion. Black's king is on e7, so if White pushes g7, Black can play Kf7 or Kf6, but cannot stop the pawn from promoting without sacrificing the king's position.
- If White plays g7, Black's only way to stop promotion is to play Kf7, but then White can play g8=Q, and after Kxg8, White's king can support the remaining pawn for an easy win.
- However, Black cannot capture the pawn on g6 immediately, and White's king can support the pawn advance.

Let's check the move g7:

1. g7 Kf7 (forced)
2. g8=Q+ Kxg8
3. Kf3 (or any king move to approach the pawn promotion square)

But after g7, Black cannot stop the pawn from promoting.

Therefore, the best move is to push the pawn:

2025-06-22 00:08:13,626 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.15s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on f2, pawns on g2 and g7  
Black: King on f7

It's White to move. The g7 pawn is one square from promotion, and Black's king is on f7, unable to stop the pawn from promoting. Promoting to a queen is the most direct and decisive way to win, as Black has no counterplay and White will have a trivial win with queen vs king.

Other promotions (rook, bishop, knight) are unnecessary and less effective.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g7g8q
```

2025-06-22 00:08:18,386 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.11s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on f2, Pawn on g2
- Black: King on g8

It's White to move. The only Black piece is the king, and White has a king and a pawn on g2. The goal is to promote the pawn and checkmate the Black king.

Let's consider the moves:

1. **g2-g3**: Advances the pawn, but doesn't immediately threaten anything. The Black king is far from the pawn, so this is safe.
2. **g2-g4**: Advances the pawn two squares, but still safe.
3. **f2-g3**: King moves toward the pawn, but not necessary.
4. **f2-f3**: King moves up, but not necessary.
5. **f2-e3, f2-e2, f2-g1, f2-f1, f2-e1**: King moves, but none are urgent.

The fastest way to promote the pawn is to push it. The Black king is on g8 and cannot approach the pawn in time.

Let's check if pushing two squares is safe: after g2-g4, Black plays Kg7, then g4-g5, Kg6, g5-g6, Kg7, g6-g7, Kg8, g7-g8=Q.

So, pushing the pawn is the fastest route.

Between g2-g3 and g2-g4, g2-g4 is faster.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g2g4
```

2025-06-22 00:08:23,497 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.56s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/7k/8/8/6P1/8/5K2/8 w - - 1 94

**White:** King on f2, pawn on g4  
**Black:** King on h7

It's White to move. The only Black piece is the king on h7, and White has a king and a pawn on g4. The goal is to promote the pawn and checkmate the Black king.

**Legal moves:**
- f2g3 (King to g3)
- f2f3 (King to f3)
- f2e3 (King to e3)
- f2g2 (King to g2)
- f2e2 (King to e2)
- f2g1 (King to g1)
- f2f1 (King to f1)
- f2e1 (King to e1)
- g4g5 (Pawn to g5)

**Analysis:**

The most direct plan is to advance the pawn, but we must ensure the Black king cannot approach and stop the pawn. Let's check if pushing the pawn is safe.

If 1. g5, Black's only move is Kh7-h8 (since the king cannot approach the pawn). Then White can continue with Kg3, Kg4, or Kf3 to support the pawn's advance.

Alternatively, White can first bring the king closer to support the pawn, but since the Black king is far away, pushing the pawn immediately is safe and fastest.

**Candidate moves:**
- g4g5: Push the pawn, aiming for promotion.
- f2f3/f2g3: Bring the king closer, but this is slower.

**Conclusion:**
Pushing the pawn is the fastest and most direct way to win.

**Final move:**
```
g4g5
```

2025-06-22 00:08:29,911 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.85s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on f2, pawn on g5
- Black: King on g8

It's White to move.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The pawn on g5 is ready to advance.
- Black's king is cut off from the queenside and the sixth rank.
- The goal is to promote the g-pawn, but Black's king is close enough to try to stop it.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g5-g6: Push the pawn. Black will play Kg7, and after g6-g7, Kg8, the pawn cannot promote without support.
2. King moves: f2-g3, f2-f3, f2-e3, etc. The idea is to bring the king closer to support the pawn's promotion.

**Calculation:**
- If 1. g6 Kg7 2. Kf3 Kxg6 (if Black tries to take the pawn, but that's not possible immediately)
- If 1. g6 Kg7 2. Kf3 Kxg6 is not possible, as the pawn is on g6.
- If 1. g6 Kg7 2. Kf3 Kg8 (waiting), 3. Kf4 Kg7, 4. Kf5 Kg8, 5. Kf6 Kh8, 6. Kf7 Kh7, 7. g7 wins.

But let's check if Black can hold a draw:

1. g6 Kg7
2. Kf3 Kg8
3. Kf4 Kg7
4. Kf5 Kg8
5. Kf6 Kh8
6. Kf7

At this point, Black is in zugzwang and must move the king away from the promotion square, so White promotes.

**Conclusion:** The immediate pawn push wins.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g5g6
```

2025-06-22 00:08:34,390 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.95s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on f2, pawn on g6.
- Black: King on f8.

It's White to move.

The pawn on g6 is one square from promotion. The Black king is on f8, directly in front of the pawn, so immediate promotion is not possible. Let's consider the options:

Legal moves:
- King moves: f2g3, f2f3, f2e3, f2g2, f2e2, f2g1, f2f1, f2e1
- Pawn move: g6g7

If we play g6g7, Black will play Kg8, and the pawn cannot promote immediately. The king must help.

The best plan is to bring the king closer to support the pawn's promotion. The fastest route is via f3, then to g4, h5, and so on.

Among the king moves, f2f3 is the most direct, heading toward the kingside to support the pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f2f3
```

2025-06-22 00:08:39,850 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.92s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on f3, pawn on g6
- Black: King on e8

It's White to move.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The pawn on g6 is one square from promotion.
- Black's king is on e8, so it can only stop the pawn by moving to f8 or d8.
- If White plays g6-g7, Black can play Ke7, but then White plays g7-g8=Q and wins.
- If White plays g7, Black can only play Kf8 (to stop the pawn from promoting), but then White can bring the king closer.

Let's check the move g6g7:

1. g6g7 Kf7 (only move to stop promotion)
2. Kf4 (or Kg4, or Ke4) — White brings the king closer, and Black cannot stop the pawn from promoting.

But let's check if Black can draw after g6g7 Kf7:

- 1. g6g7 Kf7
- 2. Kf4 (threatening Kg5 and Kh6)
- 2... Kxg7 (illegal, pawn on g7)
- 2... Kg8 (illegal, king can't move to g8)
- 2... Ke7 (doesn't help, White plays Kg5 and promotes)

So, g6g7 is winning.

**Other moves:** All king moves are slower and do not press the advantage.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to push the pawn.

```

Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on f3, pawn on g7
- Black: King on f7

It's White to move. The pawn on g7 is one square from promotion, and the Black king is on f7, unable to stop the pawn from promoting. Promoting to a queen is the most direct way to win, as it gives White overwhelming material and a trivial win.

Let's check for any stalemate traps:
- If g7-g8=Q, Black's king is on f7 and can move to f6, e7, e8, g8, g7, so not stalemate.
- Underpromotion is unnecessary; queen is best.

Therefore, the best move is to promote the pawn to a queen:

```
g7g8q
```

2025-06-22 00:08:52,636 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.07s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White: King on f3, Queen on g8
- Black: King on e7

It's White to move. The Black king is on e7, and the White queen is on g8, cutting off the 8th rank. The White king is on f3, close enough to help. 

Let's check for immediate checkmates or forced wins.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qg8e8+ (queen check on e8)
   - Black must play Kxe8 (only move)
   - Then White can bring the king closer, but it's not mate yet.

2. Qg8g7 (queen to g7, no check)
   - Not a check, but keeps control.

3. Qg8g5+ (queen check on g5)
   - Black can move to d6, f7, or e6.

4. Qg8g4+ (queen check on g4)
   - Black can move to d6, f7, or e6.

5. Qg8h7 (queen to h7, not a check)
   - Not a check.

6. Qg8g6 (queen to g6, not a check)
   - Not a check.

7. Qg8h8 (queen to h8, not a check)
   - Not a check.

8. Qg8a8 (queen to a8, not a check)
   - Not a check.

But let's look for a forced mate.

**Checkmate pattern:**
If I play Qg8e8+, the Black king is forced to take the queen (Kxe8), but then I don't have a follow-up mate.

If I play Qg8g5+, the Black king can go to f7 or e6.

But if I play Qg8g7, it's not a check, but it keeps the queen close.

But let's look at Qg8g4+. After Qg4+, Black can only go to d6, e6, or f7.

But let's try to restrict the Black king further.

What about Qg8e6+? After Qe6+, Black has to go to f8 or d8.

But wait, let's check Qg8g7+. After Qg7+, Black can only go to e6 or f8.

But the most forcing move is Qg8e8+.

After Qe8+, Black must play Kxe8.

Then White can play Kf4, and the king is close.

But let's check for a mate in one.

Is there a mate in one? Let's see:

- Qg8e8+ is not mate.
- Qg8g5+ is not mate.
- Qg8g4+ is not mate.
- Qg8g7+ is not mate.
- Qg8g6+ is not mate.
- Qg8h7 is not mate.
- Qg8h8 is not mate.
- Qg8a8 is not mate.

So, no mate in one.

But let's try to restrict the Black king as much as possible.

If I play Qg8g5+, Black king can go to f7 or e6.

If I play Qg8g4+, Black king can go to f7 or e6.

If I play Qg8g7+, Black king can go to e6 or f8.

If I play Qg8e8+, Black king must take the queen.

But then I lose the queen.

But if I play Qg8g1, I can bring the queen closer.

But the best way is to keep checking and restrict the Black king.

Therefore, the best move is to check the Black king and keep it restricted.

So, the best move is:

```
g8g5
```

It's White to move. The Black king is on e8, and the White queen is very close. Let's look for a forced mate.

**Candidate moves:**
- g5g8: Qg8+ forces the king to f7 or e7, but both are covered by the queen and king.
- g5e7: Qe7# is checkmate! The Black king on e8 cannot move to d8, d7, f7, or f8—all are covered by the queen or king.

**Verification:**
- Qe7# is checkmate. The Black king has no escape squares, and nothing can block or capture the queen.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g5e7
