Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of chess. As White, I have the first move and a wide array of opening choices. The best opening moves are those that control the center, develop pieces, and prepare for king safety.

Candidate moves:
- e2e4: Opens lines for the queen and bishop, controls the center.
- d2d4: Also controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop.
- c2c4: The English Opening, controls the center from the flank.
- g1f3: Develops the knight, controls the center, flexible.
- b1c3: Develops the knight, but less central than Nf3.

Of these, e2e4 is the most popular and statistically successful opening move, controlling the center and allowing for rapid development.

Therefore, my move is:
```
e2e4
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1p6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2

**Move history:** 1. e4 b5

Black has played the rare and dubious ...b5, which weakens the queenside and does not contribute to development or center control. White should look to punish this by seizing the center and developing rapidly.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bxb5**: Immediately grabs the pawn, but after ...c6, Black gets some development and can try to regain the pawn. Still, White is better.
2. **d4**: Grabs the center, threatening to play Bxb5 next, and if ...Bb7, then f3 and Bd3 can follow.
3. **Nc3**: Develops a piece, supports e4, and prepares to recapture on b5 if needed.
4. **Nf3**: Standard development, but doesn't immediately challenge Black's setup.

**Deeper analysis:**
- **1. Bxb5 c6 2. Ba4 (or Be2) d5**: Black gets some center, but White is ahead in development and can play exd5 Qxd5 Nc3, gaining tempo.
- **1. d4**: If ...Bb7, then Bd3 or f3, keeping the center strong. If ...a6, then Bd3 or Nf3, and White is solid.
- **1. Nc3**: Prepares to recapture on b5, but doesn't punish Black immediately.

**Best move:**
Taking the pawn is principled and puts immediate pressure on Black to prove compensation. After Bxb5, White is simply a pawn up and can develop easily.

**Final move:**
```
f1b5
```

2025-06-22 00:10:53,829 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.28s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1.e4 b5 2.Bxb5 f6**

- Black has played an unusual opening, weakening the kingside with ...f6.
- White's bishop is on b5, Black's pawn is on f6, and Black's kingside is slightly weakened.
- White to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qh5+** (but not legal, as the queen is on d1 and the bishop is on b5, so Qh5 is not a legal move)
2. **d4** (central break, but not immediately threatening)
3. **Nc3** (develops, but not urgent)
4. **Qf3** (targets f6, but not a direct threat)
5. **e5** (immediately attacks f6 and opens the center)
6. **Bxc6** (captures on c6, but not urgent)
7. **Ba4** (retreats bishop, but not necessary)
8. **Qe2** (prepares to castle queenside, but not urgent)
9. **Qh5+** (not legal due to bishop on b5)

**Tactical ideas:**
- Black's king is still in the center, and the move ...f6 has weakened the e6 and g6 squares.
- The move **e5** attacks the f6 pawn, and if Black plays ...fxe5, then Qh5+ is possible (since the bishop would no longer block the queen's path).

Let's calculate **e4-e5**:

**3.e5!**
- If ...fxe5, then Qh5+ is a strong check, exploiting the weakened kingside.
- If ...Bb7, then exf6 Nxf6, and White can continue development with advantage.
- If ...c6, then Bd3 or Ba4, keeping pressure.

**Let's check the main line:**
- 3.e5 fxe5 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qxe5 Nf6 6.Qxf6 exf6 (Black's king is exposed, White is up a pawn and has a strong initiative).

**Alternative:**
- 3.e5 c6 4.Bc4 (develops, keeps pressure).

**Conclusion:**  
**e5** is the strongest move, opening the center, attacking f6, and preparing to exploit Black's weakened kingside.

My move:
```
e4e5

2025-06-22 00:11:58,751 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.19s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1.e2e4 b7b5 2.f1b5 f7f6 3.e4e5 e7e6**

White:
- King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on b5, Knights on b1 and g1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2, e5

Black:
- King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishop on f8 and g8, Knights on b8 and g8, pawns on a7, c7, d7, f6, e6, g7, h7, b5

White to move.

**Key points:**
- Black's kingside development is lagging.
- Black's queenside is slightly weakened by b5.
- White's bishop is active on b5, pinning the knight if it comes to c6.
- White has a space advantage in the center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5d7** (Bb5xd7+): Captures on d7, forcing Black to recapture with the queen or knight, disrupting Black's development.
2. **e5f6** (e5xf6): Opens the e-file, attacks f6, and exposes Black's king.
3. **b1c3** (Nb1-c3): Develops a piece, supports the center.
4. **d2d4** (d2-d4): Grabs more center space.
5. **d1h5** (Qd1-h5): Threatens mate on e8 and h7, but Black can defend easily.

**Analysis:**

- **e5xf6**: If exf6, Nxf6 (or Qxf6), White can play Qh5+ and after g6, Qf3, threatening both a rook and f6. But after ...c6, Black can defend.
- **Bb5xd7+**: If Bxd7+, Qxd7 (or Nxd7), White can play d4, Nc3, and castle, with a comfortable position. But this gives up the bishop pair.
- **Nb1-c3**: Develops, but not forcing.
- **d2-d4**: Grabs space, but Black can play ...fxe5, dxe5, Nc6, and White's center is under pressure.
- **Qd1-h5+**: After g6, Qf3, Nc6, White is not threatening much.

**Critical move:**
- **e5xf6** is the most forcing. If Black recaptures with Nxf6, then Qh5+ is strong, as g6 is met by Qf3, threatening both rook and f6. If Black plays ...g6, then Qf3, and White is threatening Qxa8 or f6. If Black plays ...c6, then Bd3, and White keeps the initiative.

**Let's check the line:**
1. e5xf6 Nxf6
2. Qh5+ g6
3. Qf3 Nc6 (defending a8)
4. Bxc6 dxc6
5. Qxc6+ Bd7
6. Qxe6+ Be7

White is up a pawn and has a strong initiative.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e5f6
```

2025-06-22 00:12:43,573 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.47s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 4...Be7:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Bishop on b5, Knight on b1/g1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f6, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Bishop on e7, Knights on b8/g8, pawns on a7, c7, d7, e6, b5, g7, h7.

**Material:**
- White is up a pawn (f6).
- Black's kingside is undeveloped, and White has a strong pawn on f6.
- Black's queenside is slightly weakened (b5 pawn advanced).
- White's bishop on b5 is active, pinning the knight if it develops to c6.
- Black's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside due to the bishop on e7 and the pawn on f6.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f6xg7**: Captures a pawn and threatens g7-g8 promotion, but Black can respond with Bf6, blockading.
2. **f6xe7**: Captures the bishop, but Black can recapture with Qxe7, developing the queen.
3. **d2-d4**: Opens the center, but Black can respond with c6, attacking the bishop.
4. **b1-c3**: Develops a piece, but doesn't press the advantage.
5. **d1-h5+**: Checks, but Black can block with g6.
6. **b5xd7+**: Captures the bishop, but after Qxd7, Black develops the queen.
7. **b5-c6**: Attacks the rook, but Black can respond with Nxc6.

**Critical lines:**

- **f6xg7**: If 5. f6xg7, then 5...Bf6, and the pawn is blockaded. White can try Qh5+ next, but Black can play Ke7 or g6.
- **f6xe7**: If 5. f6xe7, then 5...Qxe7, and White has won the exchange (bishop for pawn), but Black's queen is active.
- **b5xd7+**: If 5. Bxd7+, then 5...Qxd7, and White has exchanged a strong bishop for a bishop, but Black's queen is developed.
- **d1-h5+**: If 5. Qh5+, then 5...g6, and White can play Qxg6+, but Black can play Kf8 or Kd8.

**Best move:**

- **f6xe7** wins a piece outright, as the bishop on e7 is unprotected and cannot be recaptured by a pawn. After 5. f6xe7, Black must recapture with the queen, and White is up a piece for a pawn. This is a decisive material advantage.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f6e7
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqk1nr/p2pP1pp/2p1p3/1B6/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6

**Move history:**  
1. e2e4 b7b5  
2. f1b5 f7f6  
3. e4e5 e7e6  
4. e5f6 f8e7  
5. f6e7 c7c6

White to move.

**Material count:**  
- White: Up a full piece (White has played e7, so White is up a piece for a pawn).
- Black: King still in the center, queens and minor pieces on the board.

**Tactical opportunities:**  
- White's e7 pawn can promote with check (e7-d8=Q or =R, =B, =N).
- Black's king is on e8, queen on d8, bishop on e7, knight on b8, rook on h8, pawns on a7, d7, c6, g7, h7.

**Candidate moves:**
1. e7-d8=Q (promote with check)
2. e7-d8=R (promote with check)
3. e7-d8=B/N (promote with check)
4. b5xc6 (capture pawn)
5. Develop pieces (but promotion is much stronger)

**Analysis of e7-d8=Q:**
- e7-d8=Q+ forces Black to respond.
- If Black plays Kxd8, White can play Bxc6, winning another pawn and keeping up the pressure.
- If Black plays Qxd8, White can play Bxc6, again winning a pawn and keeping up the pressure.
- If Black plays Bxd8, White can play Bxc6, and White is still up a piece.

**Is there any better promotion?**
- e7-d8=R+ is similar, but a queen is stronger.
- e7-d8=B+ or =N+ is not as strong as a queen.

**Is there any tactical shot with b5xc6?**
- b5xc6 attacks the queen, but Black can recapture with the knight or bishop, and White loses the promotion threat.

**Conclusion:**  
Promoting the pawn to a queen with check is the strongest move, keeping the initiative and maximizing material advantage.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-22 00:14:09,961 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.06s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 7...Kf7:**
- White queen is on d8, Black king on f7, Black bishop on e7, Black rook on h8, Black knight on g8, pawns on a7, d7, c6, e6, g7, h7.
- White bishop on b5, all other pieces in original squares except for the queen.
- It's White to move.

**Immediate tactical opportunities:**
- The Black king is exposed on f7.
- The queen on d8 can check on multiple squares: g8, f8, e8, c8, g5, a5, h4.
- The bishop on b5 can check on c6.
- Black's only developed piece is the bishop on e7, and the king is vulnerable.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d8e8+**: Queen check, but Black can block with bishop (Be7).
2. **d8f8+**: Queen check, Black can block with bishop (Bf8).
3. **d8g8+**: Queen check, Black can block with Kxg8.
4. **b5c6**: Bishop check, Black can block with dxc6.
5. **d8e7+**: Queen captures bishop with check. If Kxe7, then Ba6+ wins the rook on a8.
6. **d8d7+**: Queen check, Black can block with Nxd7 or Kf8.
7. **d8c7**: Queen check, Black can block with Qxc7.
8. **d8f6+**: Queen check, Black can play Nxf6.
9. **d8b6**: Queen attacks pawn, but not check.
10. **d8g5**: Queen check, Black can block with Nf6.
11. **d8a5**: Queen check, Black can block with Nf6.
12. **d8h4**: Queen check, Black can block with Nf6.

**Best move analysis:**
- **d8e7+**: Queen takes bishop with check. If Black plays Nxe7, then White can play Bc4+ and the king is forced to e8, then Qf7# is mate. If Kxe7, then Ba6 wins the rook on a8.
- **d8f8+**: Queen check, Black can block with Bxf8.
- **d8g8+**: Queen check, Black can play Kxg8.
- **d8d7+**: Queen check, Black can play Nxd7.
- **d8e8+**: Queen check, Black can block with Be7.

**Calculation for d8e7+:**
- 1. Qxe7+ Nxe7 (forced)
- 2. Bc4+ d5 (only move)
- 3. exd5 cxd5
- 4. Bb3 (retreat) and White is up a queen for a knight.

Alternatively:
- 1. Qxe7+ Kxe7
- 2. Ba6 (threatening to win the rook on a8)
- 2...Nxa6 (if Black tries to save the rook)
- 3. Qxa6 and White is up a queen for a knight and rook.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the bishop with check, winning material and keeping the attack.

My move:
```
d8e7
```

2025-06-22 00:15:11,652 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.07s):
Let's analyze the position:

White:
- King on e1, can castle kingside and queenside.
- Queen on d1.
- Bishop on b5, actively placed.
- Knights on b1 and g1.
- Pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2.
- Rooks on a1, h1.

Black:
- King on f7, exposed and unable to castle.
- Bishop on c8, rook on h8, knight on e7, pawns on a7, c6, d7, e6, g7, h7.

Black's king is exposed and vulnerable. White has a significant lead in development and can attack quickly. The bishop on b5 pins the c6 pawn, and the queen can join the attack. The move d4 opens the center, but let's look for something more direct.

Candidate moves:
1. Qh5+ — Immediate check, forces g6 or Kg8.
2. Qf3+ — Immediate check, forces Kg8 or Nf5.
3. Bxc6 — Captures a pawn, but less forcing.
4. Nc3 — Develops, but not urgent.
5. d4 — Opens the center, but not as forcing as a check.

Let's calculate Qh5+:
- 1. Qh5+ g6 (forced)
- 2. Qf3+ (now Kg8 is forced, as Nf5 is pinned by the bishop)
- 3. g4 (threatening f5, but not immediate)
But after Qh5+ g6, Qf3+ Kg8, White can continue development with d4 or Nc3, but Black is still under pressure.

Alternatively, Qf3+ first:
- 1. Qf3+ Kg8 (Nf5 is not possible due to the bishop on b5)
- 2. Bc4 (threatening mate on f7)
- Black must play d5 to block, but then exd5 cxd5, and White can continue attacking.

But Qh5+ is more forcing.

Let's check Qh5+ g6 Qf3+ Kg8 Bc4 d5 exd5 cxd5 Bb3, and White keeps up the pressure.

Alternatively, after Qh5+ Kg8, White can play Bc4, threatening mate on f7.

But after Qh5+ Kg8, Bc4 d5 exd5 cxd5, White can play Bb3, keeping the attack.

Therefore, the most forcing move is:
```
d1h5
```

2025-06-22 00:15:52,387 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.26s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (f6):**
- White: King on e1, Queen on h5, Bishop on b5, all pawns, all minor pieces except light-squared bishop and queen's knight.
- Black: King on f6, Bishop on e7, all pawns except e-pawn, all minor pieces except queen's knight and queen's bishop, rook on h8 and a8.

**White to move.**

**Immediate Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qe8+**: Forces Black to block with the bishop (Be7), after which White can capture the bishop with Qxe7+ and continue the attack.
2. **Qf7#**: This is checkmate, as the Black king on f6 cannot escape, and nothing can block or capture the queen on f7.
3. Other queen checks (Qh6+, Qg5+, etc.) are less forcing.

**Let's check Qf7#:**
- Black king on f6, bishop on e7, pawns block escape squares, no piece can capture on f7, and no piece can block.
- This is checkmate.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
h5f7
```

2025-06-22 00:16:19,668 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.33s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb4r/p2pnQpp/2p1p3/1B2k3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 4 10

**White to move.**

**Material:**  
- White: Queen on f7, Bishop on b5, King on e1, all pawns, all minor pieces except dark-square bishop.
- Black: King on e5, Bishop on c8, Knight on b8, Rook on a8 and h8, pawns on a7, d7, e6, c6, g7, h7.

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is extremely exposed on e5.
- White's queen is on f7, directly attacking the king.
- White's bishop on b5 controls the long diagonal and pins the c6 pawn.

**Immediate Threats:**  
- White can check with Qf4+, Qxg7+, Qh5+, or Qe7+.
- The Black king has very limited mobility.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. Qf4+ (forces the king to d5 or f6, but f6 is covered by the queen)
2. Qxg7+ (captures a pawn, but doesn't check)
3. Qe7+ (forces the king to f5 or d4)
4. Qh5+ (forces the king to d4 or f6)
5. Bxc6 (captures a pawn, but not check)
6. d4+ (not possible, pawn is on d2)

Let's check Qf4+:

- Qf4+:
  - If Kd5, then Nc3+ is coming, or c4+.
  - If Kf6, it's not possible (queen covers f6).
  - If Kd4, not possible (bishop covers d4).
  - If Kf5, not possible (queen covers f5).

So after Qf4+, only Kd5 is possible.

After Qf4+ Kd5, White can play Nc3+ (fork), and the king is in a mating net.

Alternatively, let's check Qh5+:

- Qh5+:
  - If Kd4, then Nf3+ is coming, and the king is in trouble.
  - If Kf6, not possible.
  - If Kf5, not possible.

So after Qh5+, only Kd4 is possible.

After Qh5+ Kd4, Nf3+ is a fork, and the king is forced to c5 or e4.

Alternatively, Qe7+:

- Qe7+:
  - If Kf5, not possible.
  - If Kd4, bishop covers d4.

So Qe7+ is not as strong.

Now, let's check for mate in one:

- Qf4+ is not mate.
- Qh5+ is not mate.
- Qxg7+ is not mate.

Is there a forced mate in two?

After Qf4+ Kd5, Nc3+ is very strong.

Let's check Qf4+ Kd4:

- Not possible, bishop covers d4.

So Qf4+ Kd5, Nc3+ Kc5, d4+ Kb6, Be3, and the king is trapped.

Therefore, Qf4+ is the strongest move, starting a forced mating sequence.

**Final move:**
```
f7f4
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb4r/p2pn1pp/2p1p3/1B1k4/5Q2/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 6 11

**White to move.**

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 8 Pawns
- Black: 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 1 Knight, 7 Pawns

**King safety:**  
- Black's king is on d5, exposed and vulnerable.
- White's queen is on f4, very active.
- White's bishop is on b5, controlling key diagonals.

**Immediate tactical opportunities:**
- The Black king is on d5, very exposed.
- White has several checks with the queen: f4f7, f4c4, f4g5, f4f5, f4d6, f4e4, f4d4, f4c7, f4h6, etc.
- White also has bishop moves, including b5c4+ and b5a6+.

Let's look for forcing moves: checks, captures, threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f4c4+** (Queen check)
   - Black's only legal move is to block with the bishop: Bc5.
   - Then White can play d4+ (pawn check), and after Kd6, dxc5+ wins the bishop and keeps the attack going.
   - Alternatively, after f4c4+ Bc5, White can play b4+ (pawn check), and if Bxb4, then Qxb4 and the king is still exposed.

2. **b5c4+** (Bishop check)
   - Black can play Kc5 or Kd6.
   - After Kd6, White can play Qd6# (checkmate).
   - Let's check: b5c4+ Kd6 Qd6# is checkmate.

**Let's check if this is legal:**
- b5c4+ Kd6 Qd6# (the king is on d6, queen on d6, protected by bishop on c4, that's checkmate).

**Conclusion:**  
The move **b5c4+** leads to a forced mate in two.

**Final move:**
```
b5c4

2025-06-22 00:17:13,949 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 10.88s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (12... Kc5):**
- Black's king is exposed on c5.
- White's queen is on f4, bishop on c4, and White is to move.
- Black's king is very vulnerable, and White has a clear initiative.

**Immediate Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qf4e3+** (not legal, as e3 is not reachable from f4)
2. **Qf4f8** (check, using the queen to invade the back rank)
3. **Qf4b8** (check, attacking the king from the other side)
4. **Bc4e6** (check, using the bishop)
5. **Bc4a6** (check, using the bishop)
6. **Qf4f7** (threatening to invade)
7. **Qf4c7** (threatening to invade)
8. **Qf4h6** (threatening to invade)

Let's analyze the most forcing moves first: checks.

### 1. Qf4f8+
- King cannot go to d4 (bishop covers), d6 (bishop covers), b6 (bishop covers), b4 (bishop covers).
- Only legal move is Kxc4, but that's not possible since the king is on c5 and f8 is not a direct check to c5.

Wait, let's check the geometry:
- Qf4f8 is a check to the king on c5 via the f-file. But the king is on c5, so f8 does not check the king.
- Qf4b8 is a check along the 4th rank to b8, but the king is on c5, so that's not a check either.

### 2. Bishop checks:
- Bc4e6+ is a check.
    - Black's only legal move is Kd4 (since d5 is covered by the bishop, c6 is covered by the bishop, b6 is covered by the bishop, b4 is covered by the bishop).
    - After Kd4, White can continue the attack.

- Bc4a6+ is a check.
    - King can go to d4 or b6.

### 3. Queen moves:
- Qf4f7, Qf4c7, Qf4h6, Qf4f6, etc., are not checks.

### 4. Other checks:
- None from the queen.

### Let's check Bc4e6+ in detail:
- 12. Bc4e6+ Kd4 (only move)
- Now, White can play Qe3# (but Qe3 is not reachable from f4 in one move).
- Alternatively, White can play Qf2 (not a check), or Qf3 (not a check).

### Let's check Bc4a6+:
- 12. Bc4a6+ Kd4 (only move)
- No immediate follow-up check.

### Let's check Qf4f7:
- Not a check, but threatens Qf7xg7 or Qf7xe7.

### Let's check Qf4c7:
- Not a check, but threatens Qc7xb7.

### Let's check Qf4f5:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4e5:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4d4:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4g5:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4h4:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4g4:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4e4:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4d6:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4f6:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4h6:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4f7:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4f8:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4b8:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4c7:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4f5:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4e5:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4h4:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4g4:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4e4:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4d4:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4g3:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4f3:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Qf4e3:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Bc4e6+:
- As above, only move is Kd4.

### Let's check Bc4a6+:
- As above, only move is Kd4.

### Let's check Bc4d5:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Bc4b5:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Bc4d3:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Bc4b3:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Bc4e2:
- Not a check.

### Let's check Bc4f1:
- Not a check.

### Let's check knight moves:
- None.

### Let's check king moves:
- None.

### Let's check pawn moves:
- None are checks.

## Conclusion:
The only forcing move is Bc4e6+, which drives the king to d4. After that, White can continue the attack, possibly with Qe3+ (if possible), or develop more pieces to increase the pressure.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c4e6

2025-06-22 00:18:16,586 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.79s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb1r3/p2pn1pp/2p1B3/2k5/5Q2/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 1 13

- White: King on e1, Queen on f4, Bishop on e6, Knights on b1/g1, Rooks on a1/h1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on c5, Rook on e8, Bishop on b8, Knight on d7, pawns on a7, c6, g7, h7.

**Material:** White is up a queen for a rook and bishop. Black's king is exposed on c5.

**Tactical Motifs:**
- The Black king is very exposed on c5.
- White's queen and bishop are active.
- White can consider direct checks and threats.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qf4b4+**: Immediate check, but Black can block with Bd6 or Nb6.
2. **Qf4e3+**: Check, but Black can block with Kd6 or Kb6.
3. **Qf4f5+**: Check, but Black can block with Ne5 or Kd6.
4. **Qf4d6+**: Check, but Black can block with Bxd6.
5. **Qf4c4+**: Check, but Black can block with Kb6.
6. **Qf4f7**: Threatens mate on f2, but not immediate.
7. **Qf4e4**: Threatens the king, but not a check.

**Most Forcing Move:**
- **Qf4b4+**: After this, Black has to respond. Let's check the lines:

1. **Qf4b4+ cxb4**: Not possible, pawn is on c6.
2. **Qf4b4+ Kd5**: King moves, but then Qc4# is mate.
3. **Qf4b4+ Kd6**: King moves, but then Qd6# is mate.
4. **Qf4b4+ Nb6**: Block, but then Qxb6# is mate.
5. **Qf4b4+ Bd6**: Block, but then Qxd6# is mate.

**Conclusion:** Qf4b4+ is a forced mate in one or two, depending on Black's response.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f4b4
```

Let's analyze the position:

- Material: White is up a full rook (White has all pieces except a rook, Black is missing a rook and a bishop).
- King safety: Black's king is exposed on b4, White's king is safe on e1.
- White's light-squared bishop on e6 is very strong, controlling key diagonals and cutting off the Black king.
- Black's pieces are undeveloped and the king is in danger of being mated.
- White has many pawn moves available, and can also develop the knight or queen's bishop.

Candidate moves:
1. **Bishop moves**: e6-g8, e6-f7, e6-d7, e6-f5, e6-d5, e6-g4, e6-c4, e6-h3, e6-b3
   - e6-b3+ is a check, forcing the Black king to a3 or a5.
   - e6-c4+ is also a check, but the king can go to a5 or a3.
2. **Knight development**: b1-c3, b1-a3
   - b1-c3 threatens to bring more pieces into the attack, and covers a4.
3. **Pawn moves**: Many, but not immediately threatening.

Let's check the forcing lines with checks:
- **e6-b3+**:
  - If Kxb3, then Nc3+ is mate (since a2 and b4 are covered by bishop and knight).
  - If Ka5, then Nc3 is a strong move, threatening b5+ and trapping the king.

- **e6-c4+**:
  - If Kxc4, then d3+ is mate (since c4, d4, and b3 are covered).
  - If Ka5, again Nc3 is strong.

But let's check **e6-b3+**:
- 1. Be6-b3+ Kxb3 (forced)
- 2. Nc3# (the king is mated: a2 and b4 are covered by the bishop, c3 by the knight)

This is a forced mate in two.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e6b3
```

2025-06-22 00:19:29,867 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.95s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, Bishop on b3, all pawns except d2 and f2, all other pieces present.
- Black: King on c5, rook on e8, bishop and knight gone, all pawns except f7 and d7, all other pieces present.

**Position:**
- Black's king is exposed on c5.
- White's bishop on b3 is very strong, controlling key diagonals.
- White has a big lead in development and king safety.
- Black's rook on e8 is not active, and Black's queenside pawns are weak.
- White can develop quickly and attack.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b3g8** (Bishop takes rook): This is a free rook! After Bxg8, White will be up a full rook.
2. Other bishop moves (b3f7, b3e6, etc.) don't threaten as much.
3. Developing moves (Nc3, d4, etc.) are less urgent than capturing the rook.

**Tactics:**
- After Bxg8, Black cannot recapture, and White will be up a rook.
- No immediate counterplay for Black.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the rook with the bishop.

2025-06-22 00:20:28,508 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.23s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (after 15...Bb7):**
- White: King on e1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on g8, Knights on b1 and g1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on c5, Rook on e8, Bishop on b7, Knights on d7 and e7, pawns on a7, c6, g7, h7.

**Material:**
- White: 2R, 2N, 1B, 8P
- Black: 1R, 2N, 1B, 7P

**Tactical and Strategic Considerations:**
- White's bishop on g8 is very active, pinning the knight on e7 to the king on c5.
- Black's king is exposed on c5.
- White is behind in development but Black's king is very unsafe.
- White can consider moves that increase pressure on the pinned knight or bring more pieces into the attack.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Bishop moves:** The bishop on g8 is very strong; moving it would lose the pin.
2. **Knight development:** Nb1–c3+ is a check, attacking the king and developing a piece.
3. **Pawn moves:** Not urgent; development is more important.
4. **Queen moves:** No queen on the board.
5. **Rook moves:** Rooks are not yet connected.

**Critical Candidate:**
- **b1c3+**: Develops a knight with tempo, checks the king, and increases pressure on d7 and e7. This could force the king to move or block with a piece, possibly leading to further tactical opportunities.

**Let's check the consequences of 1. Nc3+:**
- If ...Kd6, then d2-d4+ is possible, opening the center further.
- If ...Kb6, then Na4+ could be a follow-up.
- If ...Kd4, then Nf3+ is a check.
- If ...Kb4, then a3+ traps the king.

**Other moves:**
- Developing the other knight (g1f3) is slower.
- Moving the bishop loses the pin.
- Pawn moves are too slow.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play **b1c3+**, developing with tempo and keeping up the pressure.

2025-06-22 00:21:30,541 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.48s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (Rg8):**
- White: King on e1, Knight on c3, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on c5, Rook on g8, Bishop on b7, Knight on e7, pawns on a7, c6, d7, g7, h7.

**Material count:**
- White: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 8 pawns
- Black: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 7 pawns (missing f7 pawn)

**King safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on c5.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Development:**
- White has a big lead in development. Black's queenside is undeveloped and king is exposed.

**Tactical considerations:**
- White can consider moves that attack the Black king or threaten to win material.
- Moves like Nc3-e4+ or Nc3-a4+ check the king.
- Nc3-d5 attacks the bishop on b7 and threatens to invade.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nc3-d5+**: Check, attacks the bishop on b7, forces the king to move. If Kd6, then b3 wins the bishop. If Kd4, then Nxe7 wins the knight.
2. **Nc3-a4+**: Check, but the king can go to d6 or b5.
3. **Nc3-e4+**: Check, king can go to d4 or b6.
4. **Nc3-b5**: Attacks the king, but not as forcing as Nd5+.
5. **Developing moves** (like d2-d4): Not urgent, since we have a direct check.

**Calculation for Nc3-d5+:**
- 1. Nc3-d5+ Kd6 (if Kxd5, then c2-c4+ wins the king)
- 1... Kd6 2. Nxe7 Kxe7 (if b3, then bishop is trapped)
- 1... Kd4 2. Nxe7 wins the knight.
- 1... Kb5 2. Nc7+ wins the rook on a8.

**Best move:**
- **Nd5+** is a powerful check that attacks the king and threatens to win material.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c3d5

Let's analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (move 17...Ke5-c5):**
- White: King on e1, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, Knight on d5, Rook on h1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on c5, Rook on a8, Rook on e8, Bishop on b7, Knight on e7, pawns on a7, c6, d7, g7, h7

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 8 pawns
- Black: 2 Rooks, Bishop, Knight, 6 pawns

**Key features:**
- Black's king is exposed on c5.
- White's knight on d5 is very powerful, attacking e7 and c7.
- Black's bishop on b7 is defended by the c6 pawn.
- White is down the exchange (rook for knight), but Black's king is very exposed.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d5xe7 (check): Forks king and rook, but after ...Rxe7, White wins the exchange back.
2. d5-c7: Attacks the bishop on b7, but doesn't give check.
3. d5-f6: Attacks the rook on e8 and the bishop on b7.
4. d5-b6: Attacks the king, but b6 is not protected.
5. d5-f4: Not threatening much.
6. d5-b4: Not threatening much.
7. d5-e3: Retreat.
8. d5-c3: Retreat.

**Tactical check:**
- d5xe7+ is a check. Let's see what happens:
    - 1. Nxe7 Rxe7 (forced)
    - Now, the black king is still exposed on c5.
    - White can play d4+ (pawn push), opening the center and attacking the king.
    - After cxd4, c3 is possible, but Black's king is still exposed.

**Alternative:**
- d5-c7 attacks the bishop, but Black can play Rec8, defending the bishop and attacking the knight.

**Another check:**
- d5-f6 attacks the rook and bishop, but doesn't give check.

**Best move:**
- d5xe7+ is the most forcing, wins the exchange back, and keeps Black's king exposed.

**Conclusion:**
```
d5e7

2025-06-22 00:23:14,389 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.84s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 19...d5:**
- White: King on e1, rook on a1, bishop on c1, knight on e7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King on c5, rook on e8, bishop on b7, pawns on a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Material:**
- White is up a rook for a pawn (White has an extra rook, Black has an extra bishop and pawn).
- White's knight is on e7, deep in enemy territory.
- Black's king is exposed on c5.
- Black's rook is on e8, bishop on b7.

**Immediate threats and candidate moves:**
- White can play d4+ to check the king, but the pawn is on d2, so d2d4 is not check.
- White can play d4, opening the center and threatening to open lines against the king.
- White can play c3, attacking the king and opening the c-file.
- White can play b4+, but the pawn is on b2.
- White can play d3, but that doesn't seem to do much.
- White can play c4+, but the pawn is on c2.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The Black king is very exposed. If White can open the center, the king could be in trouble.
- The knight on e7 is very strong, controlling key squares.

**Best candidate moves:**
1. d2d4: Opens the center, threatens to open lines against the king. If cxd4, then Nf5+ is possible.
2. c2c3: Attacks the king directly, but Black can play Kd6.
3. f2f4: Prepares to open the f-file, but not immediately threatening.
4. a2a3: Not urgent.
5. h2h4: Not urgent.

**Let's calculate d2d4:**
- d2d4, Kd6 (if cxd4, then Nf5+ is very strong)
- d2d4, exd4 (not possible, no pawn on e5)
- d2d4, Kd6, Nf5+ (forks king and rook, but king can move to e6 or c7)
- d2d4, Kd6, Nf5+ Ke6, Nxg7+ Kf7, Nxe8 Rxe8

But after d2d4, if cxd4, then Nf5+ forks king and rook.

**Let's check c2c3:**
- c2c3, Kd6 (king escapes)
- c2c3, dxc3, bxc3, Kd6 (king escapes)

**Let's check Nf5:**
- Not possible, knight is on e7.

**Let's check c2c4:**
- Not possible, pawn is on c2.

**Let's check d2d4:**
- If Black plays Kd6, then Nf5+ is strong.
- If Black plays cxd4, then Nf5+ is even stronger.

Therefore, the best move is to open the center with d2d4, exposing the Black king.

My move:
```
d2d4
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn2r3/pb2N1pp/2p5/3p4/3k4/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ - 0 20

White: King on e1, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, Knight on e7, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2  
Black: King on d4, Rook on a8, Rook on e8, Bishop on b7, Pawns on a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Material:**
- White is up a knight for a pawn.
- Black's king is exposed on d4.
- White's knight on e7 is very strong, attacking c6 and f5 squares.
- White's king is safe, and White has both castling rights.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf5+** (not possible, knight is on e7)
2. **Be3+** (c1e3): Bishop check, forces Black's king to move.
3. **c3+**: Pawn check, but Black can play Kc5.
4. **c4**: Pawn move, but not a check.
5. **a4**: Pawn move, not relevant.
6. **h4**: Pawn move, not relevant.
7. **Kf1**: King move, not relevant.

**Key tactical idea:** Black's king is exposed. If we can check and force the king to a worse square, we may win material or even checkmate.

**Check options:**
- **Be3+**: Bishop to e3 gives check. Black's only legal moves are Kc4 or Kc5.
    - If Kc4, then b3# is checkmate (pawn on b2 moves to b3, king is boxed in by its own pieces and bishop).
    - If Kc5, then b4# is checkmate (pawn on b2 moves to b4, king is boxed in).

So, **Be3+** is a forced mate in two!

**Calculation:**
1. Be3+ Kc4 (or Kc5)
2. b3# (or b4#)

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play the check with the bishop.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn2r3/pb2N1pp/2p5/3p4/4k3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 2 21

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White: Rooks on a1, e1; Knight on e7; Bishop on e3; King on e1; pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: Rooks on a8, e8; Bishop on b7; King on e4; pawns on a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Key features:**
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- White's knight on e7 is deep in enemy territory.
- White's bishop on e3 eyes the a7 pawn and controls important diagonals.
- White has a huge lead in development and Black's king is vulnerable.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7g8+** (Knight check): Forces Black's king to f5 or f5, but after ...Rxg8, White loses the knight.
2. **e3a7** (Bishop takes pawn): Wins a pawn, threatens mate on f3, but doesn't immediately threaten Black's king.
3. **e3g5** (Bishop check): Forces Black's king to d4 or f5.
4. **e3c5** (Bishop check): King must move, but c5 is less forcing than g5.
5. **e3d4** (Bishop check): King must move, but d4 is not as forcing as g5.
6. **e3h6** (Bishop attacks g7): Not immediately threatening.
7. **g1h3** (Develops): Not urgent.
8. **a1d1** (Rook to open file): Not urgent.

**Let's analyze the checks:**

- **e3g5+**: If ...Kf5, then g5xg7 is a check and wins a rook. If ...Kd4, then c2c3+ is a discovered check and wins the king.
- **e7g8+**: After ...Rxg8, White loses the knight.
- **e3c5+**: ...Kf5, then c5xg7 is not a check.

**Let's try e3g5+:**
- 1. Be3-g5+ Kd4 (if Kf5, then g5xg7+ wins a rook)
- 2. c2-c3+ Kc5 (if ...Kc4, then b2-b3# is mate)
- 3. b2-b4# is mate!

**So:**
1. Be3-g5+ Kd4
2. c2-c3+ Kc5
3. b2-b4#

**This is a forced mate in 3!**

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e3g5
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn2r3/p3N1pp/b1p5/3p2B1/4k3/8/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 4 22

- White: King e1, Rook a1, Knight e7, Bishop g5, pawns a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King e4, Rook a8, Rook e8, Bishop a6, pawns a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Material:**
- White is up a full piece (White has an extra knight).
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- White's knight on e7 is very strong, threatening forks and checks.
- White's bishop on g5 is active, eyeing the e7–h4 diagonal.

**Immediate tactics:**
- White can check with the knight: e7g6+ or e7f5+.
- White can check with the bishop: g5h6+ or g5f6+.
- White can play for mate threats or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7g6+** (Knight check): King can only go to f5 or d4. If Kf5, then g5f4+ wins the rook on e8.
2. **e7f5+** (Knight check): King can go to f5 or d3. If Kf5, then g5f4+.
3. **g5h6+** (Bishop check): King can go to d4 or f5.
4. **g5f6+** (Bishop check): King can go to f5 or d3.
5. **g5f4+** (Bishop check): King can go to f5 or d3.

Let's calculate **e7g6+**:
- 1. Ne7-g6+ Kd4 (if Kf5, then Bf4+ wins the rook)
- 2. Bf4 (if Kd4, then Be3# is mate, but the bishop is on a6, so not possible)
- 2. ... Kc5 (if Kc4, then b3# is not possible because pawn is on b2)
- Let's check if there is a forced mate.

Now, **e7f5+**:
- 1. Ne7-f5+ Kd3 (if Kf5, then Bf4+)
- 2. Bf4 (if Kd3, then Rd1# is not possible because rook is on a1)
- Not a forced mate.

Now, **g5f4+**:
- 1. Bg5-f4 Kxf4 (if Kf5, then Ne3+ wins the rook)
- Not forcing.

Now, **g5h6+**:
- 1. Bg5-h6 Kd4 (if Kf5, then Ne3+)
- Not forcing.

Now, **e7g8** (knight retreat): Not forcing.

Now, **g1h3** (developing): Not urgent.

**Best move:**
The most forcing move is **e7g6+**. Let's check the lines:

1. Ne7g6+ Kd4
    - White can play Be3+ (but bishop is on g5, so not possible).
    - White can play c3+ (but pawn is on c2).
    - White can play O-O-O (castling), but not urgent.
    - White can play Nf4 (but knight is on g6).
    - White can play c3 (preparing to trap the king).
    - White can play Bf4 (attacking the king).

But after Ne7g6+ Kd4, White is not mating immediately, but Black's king is still exposed.

If 1. Ne7g6+ Kf5, then 2. g5f4 wins the rook on e8.

Therefore, **e7g6+** is the best move, as it forces the king to move and wins material or exposes the king further.

My move:
```
e7g6
```

2025-06-22 00:25:35,385 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 10.46s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn2r3/p5pp/2p3N1/3p2B1/4k3/8/PPP1bPPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 6 23

**White:** King e1, Rooks a1, h1, Knight g6, Bishop g5, Pawns a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King e4, Rooks a8, e8, Bishop e2, Pawns a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Material:**  
White: Rooks (2), Knight (1), Bishop (1), 6 pawns  
Black: Rooks (2), Bishop (1), 5 pawns

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Tactical Motifs:**  
- White has a knight on g6 and a bishop on g5, both pointing toward the Black king.
- Black's king is very exposed, and White can look for checks and possible mating nets.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **g6h8+** (Knight check): King can't move to f5, f3, d3, d5, f4, d4 (all covered or occupied). Black must block or move king.
2. **g5d8** (Bishop check): King can't move to d3, d5, f3, f5, f4, d4 (all covered or occupied). Black must block with rook or bishop.
3. **g5e3** (Bishop check): Not as forcing.
4. **g5h6** (Bishop check): Not as forcing.
5. **g6e5+** (Knight check): King can take the knight.
6. **g6f4+** (Knight check): King can take the knight.

Let's analyze the most forcing checks:

### 1. g6h8+ (Knight to h8 check)
- Black's only legal move is to play Rxh8 (since the king can't move anywhere).
- After Rxh8, White can play Bishop d8, pinning the rook to the king, but Black can block with the bishop or rook.

### 2. g5d8+ (Bishop to d8 check)
- Black's only legal move is to play Rxd8 (since the king can't move anywhere).
- After Rxd8, White can play Nf6+ (knight fork), but the king can take on f6.

### 3. g5e3+ (Bishop to e3 check)
- King can move to f5 or f3.

### 4. g5h6+ (Bishop to h6 check)
- King can move to f5 or f3.

### 5. g6e7 (Knight to e7)
- Not a check, but attacks the bishop and covers f5.

### 6. g6e5+ (Knight to e5 check)
- King can take the knight.

### 7. g6f4+ (Knight to f4 check)
- King can take the knight.

### Let's check the most forcing move: **g6h8+**

1. g6h8+ Rxh8 (forced)
2. g5d8+ Rxd8 (forced)
3. Nf7 (attacking the rook on d8 and threatening mate on g5)
   - But after Rf8, White can play Kxe2 and is up material.

But let's check if there is a forced mate.

Alternatively, after 1. g5d8+ Rxd8, is there a follow-up? Not immediately.

Alternatively, what about 1. g5e3+? King moves to f5 or f3.

Alternatively, what about 1. g5h6+? King moves to f5 or f3.

Alternatively, what about 1. g6e7? Not a check, but threatens Nf5+.

Alternatively, what about 1. g5f6? Not a check, but threatens mate on g7.

But the most forcing move is **g6h8+**.

**Let's check the line:**
1. g6h8+ Rxh8
2. g5d8+ Rxd8
3. Nf7 (threatening Nxd8 and also threatening mate on g5)

But after Rf8, White can play Kxe2 and is up material.

Alternatively, after 1. g5d8+ Rxd8, 2. Nf7, Black can play Rf8, and White can play Kxe2, and White is up a piece.

Alternatively, after 1. g5d8+ Rxd8, 2. Nf7, if Black plays Rd7, White can play Ne5+ and win the rook.

Alternatively, after 1. g5d8+ Rxd8, 2. Nf7, if Black plays Rf8, White can play Kxe2, and White is up a piece.

So, the best move is **g6h8+**.

g6h8

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn2r2N/p5pp/2p5/3p2B1/4k3/5b2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 8 24

**White:** King e1, Rooks a1, h1, Bishop g5, Knight h8, Pawns a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King e4, Rooks a8, e8, Bishop f3, Pawns a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Material:**  
- White: 2R, B, N, 6P  
- Black: 2R, B, 5P

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Tactics:**  
- White's knight on h8 is awkward but can jump to f7 or g6.
- White's bishop on g5 is attacking and can check on d8 or e7.
- Black's bishop on f3 is powerful, but White can try to create threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5d8+**: Bishop check. Black must respond. If ...Rxd8, then Nf7+ forking king and rook.
2. **g5e7+**: Bishop check. King must move, but not as forcing.
3. **h8f7**: Knight attacks bishop, but not forcing.
4. **g5h4**: Bishop attacks bishop, but not forcing.
5. **g1h3**: Develops, but not urgent.

Let's calculate **1. Bg5-d8+**:

- 1. Bd8+ Rxd8 (forced, otherwise loses rook)
- 2. Nf7 (forks king and rook)
- If ...Kf5, then Nxd8, White wins an exchange and gets a rook for a bishop.
- If ...Kf4, same.

Alternatively, after 1. Bd8+ Kf4, White can play Nf7, attacking the rook and bishop.

But after 1. Bd8+ Rxd8 2. Nf7, Black's king is still exposed, and White is winning material.

**Is there a mate?**
- After 1. Bd8+ Rxd8 2. Nf7, Black's king is still in the center and White has a material advantage.

**Other checks:**
- 1. Bg5e7+ Kf4, not as strong.

**Conclusion:**  
1. **Bd8+** is the most forcing and wins material.

My move:
```
g5d8

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn1r3N/p5pp/2p5/3p4/4k3/5b2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 25

**White:** King e1, Rook a1, Knight h8, pawns a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King e4, Rook d8, Rook a8, Bishop f3, pawns a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Material count:**  
White: Rook, Knight, 6 pawns  
Black: 2 Rooks, Bishop, 5 pawns

**Key features:**
- White's knight on h8 is oddly placed but not attacked.
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- Black has two active rooks and a bishop, but the king is vulnerable.
- White has castling rights and a rook on a1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h8f7 (Knight fork, attacking bishop and rook)
2. h8g6 (Knight attacks bishop, but less forcing)
3. a1d1 (Rook to open file, pressure on d5)
4. e1d2/f1 (King safety, but not urgent)
5. h2h4 (pawn push, not urgent)
6. g2f3 (pawn takes bishop, but not possible as pawn is on f2)
7. a2a4, b2b4, c2c4 (pawn pushes, not urgent)

**Tactical ideas:**
- h8f7 attacks both bishop on f3 and rook on d8.
- If Black plays ...Rxf8, White can take the bishop.
- If Black plays ...Rd7, White can take the bishop.
- If Black plays ...Re8, White can take the bishop.
- Black's king is exposed, so White should look for tactics.

**Calculation of h8f7:**
1. h8f7
   - If Black plays ...Rd7, then N(e)5+ is possible, but not immediately.
   - If ...B(g2), then Nxd8 wins the exchange.
   - If ...Re8, then N(d6)+ is possible.

But after h8f7, the bishop on f3 is attacked and the rook on d8 is attacked. Black cannot defend both.

**Conclusion:**  
The move h8f7 is a double attack (fork) on the bishop and rook. Black cannot save both. This wins material and increases White's advantage.

**Final move:**
```
h8f7
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r2r4/p4Npp/n1p5/3p4/4k3/5b2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 2 26

**White:** King e1, Rook a1, Knight f7, Rook h1, pawns a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2  
**Black:** King e4, Rook a8, Rook d8, Bishop f3, pawns a7, c6, d5, g7, h7, Knight a6

**Material:**  
White: 2 Rooks, Knight, 6 pawns  
Black: 2 Rooks, Bishop, Knight, 6 pawns

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Tactics:**  
- White's knight on f7 attacks the bishop on f3.
- Black's bishop on f3 is only defended by the king.
- White's knight can also check on g5 or e5.
- White's rook on a1 can swing to d1 (attacking the pinned rook on d8).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxd8** (f7d8): Captures the rook, but after Rxd8, White's knight is lost.
2. **Nxd8+ Kxd8**: Not possible, as the king is not on d8.
3. **Nxd8 Rxd8**: White loses the knight for a rook, but then can play gxf3.
4. **Nxd8 Rxd8, gxf3**: White is up the exchange.
5. **Nxd8 Rxd8, gxf3+**: White can win the bishop.
6. **Nxd8 Rxd8, gxf3+ Kxf3**: Black's king is very exposed.
7. **Nxd8 Rxd8, gxf3+ Kxf3, Rg1**: White can bring the rook to g1 with check.

Alternatively:
- **Ng5+** (f7g5): Check, but after Kf4, White doesn't gain much.
- **Nh8**: Retreat, not useful.
- **Nd6+**: f7d6+ is not legal.
- **Nxe5**: f7e5, check, but after dxe4, White loses the knight.

**Best move:**
- **Nxd8** (f7d8) wins the exchange and then White can recapture the bishop with gxf3, ending up with rook and knight vs rook and knight, with a safer king and better chances.

**Final move:**
```
f7d8

Let's analyze the position step by step:

**Position (White to move):**
- White: King on e1, rook on a1, knight on d8, pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, g1 (rook), bishop on f3
- Black: King on e4, rook on b8, bishop on f3, knight on a6, pawns on a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Material:**
- White: Rook, knight, rook, 7 pawns
- Black: Rook, knight, bishop, 5 pawns

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Threats:**
- White's knight on d8 is very active, and Black's king is exposed.
- Black's bishop on f3 is strong, but White can challenge it.
- White can consider checks and attacks against the exposed Black king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d8f7+ (Check with the knight)
2. d8e6 (Check with the knight)
3. a1d1 (Bring rook to the center, threaten discovered checks)
4. g1h3 (Develop rook, threaten to swing to the kingside)
5. g2f3 (Capture bishop, but loses rook for bishop)

Let's analyze the checks first:

**1. d8f7+**
- Black king can go to f5, d4, or d3.
- If Kd4, White can play c3+.
- If Kf5, White can play g4+.

**2. d8e6+**
- Black king can go to f5, d3, or f3.
- If Kf5, White can play g4+.
- If Kd3, White can play c3+.

**3. a1d1**
- Threatens discovered check with the knight.
- Black has no immediate threat.

**4. g1h3**
- Prepares to swing rook to the kingside, but not urgent.

**5. g2f3**
- Captures bishop, but loses rook for bishop, not optimal.

**Best move:**
The knight checks are forcing and keep the initiative. Let's look at d8f7+:

- 27. Nd8-f7+ Ke4-f5 (if Kd4, c3+ is strong)
- Now, g4+ is a strong follow-up, but let's see if there's something better.

Alternatively, d8e6+:

- 27. Nd8-e6+ Ke4-f5 (if Kd3, c3+)
- Again, g4+ is possible.

Between the two, d8f7+ is more forcing, as it keeps the king on the edge.

**Final move:**
```
d8f7

2025-06-22 00:28:49,083 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.02s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- White: Rook (a1), Knight (f7), King (e1), Rook (h1), pawns (a2, c2, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: Rook (b2), Bishop (f3), King (e4), pawns (a7, c6, d5, g7, h7), Knight (a6)

**King safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- White's king is relatively safe on e1.

**Tactical considerations:**
- White's knight on f7 is very strong, attacking the bishop on f3 and controlling key squares.
- Black's rook on b2 is active, but not immediately threatening.
- Black's bishop on f3 is powerful, but can be attacked.

**Candidate moves:**
1. f7h8: Retreating the knight, but loses pressure.
2. f7d8: Retreating, but not threatening.
3. f7h6: Attacks the bishop on f3.
4. f7d6+: Check! This is a forcing move. Let's analyze:
   - If Kd4, then Nf5+ forks king and bishop.
   - If Kf4, then g2xf3 is possible.
   - If Kd5, then Nf5+ again.
   - If Kf5, then Nxh8 wins the exchange.
5. f7g5: Attacks the bishop, but not as forcing as a check.
6. f7e5: Check! But the king can take the knight.
7. g1h3: Develops, but not urgent.
8. a1d1: Brings rook to the center, but not as forcing as a check.

**Best move analysis:**
- f7d6+ is a check and forces the black king to move. Let's look at the lines:
   - 1. Nf7-d6+ Ke5 (only move)
   - 2. Nf7-d6+ Kd4 (only move)
   - 2. Nf7-d6+ Kf4 (only move)
   - 2. Nf7-d6+ Kd5 (only move)
   - 2. Nf7-d6+ Kf5 (only move)

But let's check if the knight is hanging after the check:
- After 1. Nf7-d6+ Ke5, the knight is not attacked.
- After 1. Nf7-d6+ Kd4, the knight is not attacked.
- After 1. Nf7-d6+ Kd5, the knight is not attacked.
- After 1. Nf7-d6+ Kf4, the knight is not attacked.

After the check, White can follow up with g2xf3, attacking the bishop and opening the g-file.

**Conclusion:**
The move 1. Nf7-d6+ is the most forcing and puts the black king in a precarious position.

My move:
```
f7d6

2025-06-22 00:29:30,360 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 11.92s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (White to move):**
- White: King e1, Rook a1, Knight d6, pawns a2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King e5, Rook b2, Bishop f3, pawns a7, c6, g7, h7

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Knight, 5 pawns
- Black: Rook, Bishop, 5 pawns

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on e5.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Threats:**
- White's knight on d6 is very powerful, attacking c4, e4, f5, b5, b7, f7, e8, c8.
- Black's rook on b2 is active, but not immediately threatening.
- Black's bishop on f3 is strong, but not attacking anything directly.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6c4** (Knight to c4): Attacks e3, b2, and covers e5. But Black can play Kd4 and the knight is not as active.
2. **d6e4** (Knight to e4): Attacks f2, g3, c3, d2, f6, c5, but Black can play Bxe4, fxe4 Kxe4, and Black's king becomes active.
3. **d6f5** (Knight to f5): Attacks g7, h6, e3, d4, but Black can play Kxf5, losing the knight.
4. **d6b7** (Knight to b7): Attacks a5, c5, d8, but not very active.
5. **d6e8** (Knight to e8): Attacks g7, f6, c7, but not very active.
6. **a1d1** (Rook to d1): Pins the king to the bishop, but Black can play Bxd1, Kxd1, and material is even.
7. **g1h3** (Develops the rook): Not urgent.
8. **c2c4** (Pawn push): Attacks the king, but Black can play Kd4.
9. **e1d2** (King move): Not urgent.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The knight on d6 is very strong, and the Black king is exposed.
- If we play Nc4+, the king must move, but then what?
- If we play Nf5+, the king can take the knight.
- If we play g2f3, we attack the bishop, but Black can play Bxf3, gxf3 Kxd6.

**Best move:**
- Let's look for a forcing move. The Black king is exposed. Let's try to check the king and see if we can win material or force a favorable endgame.

**Move:**
- **Nc4+** (d6c4): This checks the king, forces it to move, and keeps the initiative.

After 1. Nc4+ Kd4 (only move), White can play Nxb2 and win the rook, but then Black can play Kxc4. However, after Nc4+ Kd4, is there a better follow-up?

Alternatively, after Nc4+ Kf4, White can play g3+ and win the bishop.

But let's check the calculation:

1. Nc4+ Kd4
2. Nxb2 Kxc4

Material is even, but White's king is safer.

Alternatively, after Nc4+ Kf4
2. g3+ Kg4 (or Kf5)
3. Nxb2

White wins the rook.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to check with the knight and win the rook.

So, the move is:
```
d6c4

2025-06-22 00:30:22,773 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.92s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- White: King e1, Rook a1, Knight c4, Pawns a2, c2, f2, g2, h2, g1 (rook), h1 (rook), g2, h2, f2, c2, a2
- Black: King e4, Bishop f3, Pawns a7, c6, d5, h7, g7, b2, Knight a6

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Knight, 6 pawns
- Black: Bishop, Knight, 6 pawns

**Imbalances:**
- Black has a dangerous pawn on b2, threatening to promote.
- White's knight is active on c4.
- Black's king is centralized on e4.
- White's king is relatively safe on e1.
- White has a rook on a1, which can become active.

**Threats:**
- Black's pawn on b2 is a major threat.
- Black's bishop on f3 controls important diagonals.
- White's knight can attack the bishop or try to stop the b-pawn.
- White's rook on a1 can go to b1 to attack the b2 pawn.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **c4b2**: Knight captures the b2 pawn, eliminating Black's most dangerous threat.
2. **a1b1**: Rook to b1, attacking the b2 pawn.
3. **c4d6+**: Knight check, but after Bxd6, Black's bishop is even more powerful.
4. **g1h3**: Developing the rook, but not urgent.
5. **c2c3**: Trying to undermine Black's center, but not urgent.
6. **e1d2**: Centralizing the king, but not urgent.

**Critical Analysis:**
- **c4b2**: If White plays Nxb2, the knight captures the dangerous pawn, but then Black can play Bxg2, winning a pawn and threatening to push the h-pawn. However, White can then play Rg1, attacking the bishop.
- **a1b1**: If White plays Rb1, Black can play dxc4, and the b2 pawn is still protected by the bishop. Not effective.
- **c4d6+**: Knight check, but after Bxd6, White loses the knight for the bishop, and the b2 pawn remains.
- **c4e3**: Knight attacks the bishop, but Black can play d4, defending the bishop.

**Best Move:**
- **c4b2** is the most urgent and critical move. It eliminates Black's most dangerous threat (the b2 pawn), and after Bxg2, White can play Rg1, attacking the bishop and gaining activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c4b2
```

2025-06-22 00:31:22,173 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.34s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Knight (b2), Bishop (f3), King (e1), pawns (a2, c2, g2, h2, f2)
- Black: Rook (b8), Bishop (f3), Knight (b8), King (e4), pawns (a7, c6, d5, g7, h7)

**Key features:**
- Black's king is centralized but exposed.
- White's rook is on a1, can be activated.
- White's knight on b2 is not very active but can jump to c4 or d3.
- White's king is safe.
- Black's rook is on b8, knight on b8, bishop on f3.
- White has the move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. b2c4 (Nb2-c4): Attacks the exposed king, threatens to jump to d6 or e5, and covers key squares.
2. a1d1 (Ra1-d1): Puts rook on open file, threatens to invade d6 or d7.
3. a1c1 (Ra1-c1): Targets c6 pawn.
4. g1h3 (Ng1-h3): Develops the knight, but not very active.
5. h2h3 (pawn move): Not urgent.
6. e1d2 (K move): Not urgent.

**Tactical ideas:**
- Nb2-c4 attacks the king and threatens to fork on d6 or e5.
- Ra1-d1 puts pressure on the d-file, but Black's king is on e4, so not an immediate threat.
- Ra1-c1 attacks c6, but Black can defend with ...Rb6.

**Calculation:**
- 1. Nb2-c4 dxc4 (if Black takes the knight), then White can play g2xf3, but loses a piece.
- 1. Nb2-c4+ Kd4 (forced), then White can play Na5, threatening c6 and b7.
- 1. Nb2-c4+ Kf4, then White can play g2xf3, but Black's king is still exposed.

- 1. Ra1-d1 Bxd1, Kxd1, but then White loses the rook for bishop, not good.

- 1. a1-c1, threatens c6, but Black can play Rb6.

**Best move:**
- Nb2-c4+ is a check, forces the king to move, and brings the knight to a more active square. It also threatens to jump to d6 or e5, and supports the c2 pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b2c4
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (White to move):**
- White: King e1, Rook a1, Knight c4, Bishop f3, Pawns a2, c2, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King e4, Bishop f3, Knight a6, Pawns a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Knight, Bishop, 5 pawns
- Black: Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Immediate threats:**
- White can check the Black king with the knight: c4d6+ or c4e3+.
- White's rook is ready to enter the game.
- Black's bishop on f3 is strong, but White's pieces are more active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c4d6+**: Knight check. Black king must move. If Kd4, then Nf5+ is possible. If Kf4, White can play g3+.
2. **c4e3+**: Knight check. King can go to f4 or d4.
3. **a1d1**: Rook to open file, but not urgent.
4. **g2f3**: Recapture bishop, but Black's king is too active for this to be safe.
5. **c2c3**: Try to undermine Black's center, but not urgent.
6. **h2h4**: Not urgent.

**Calculation of c4d6+:**
- 1. Nc4-d6+ Ke5 (if Kd4, then Nf5+ forks king and bishop)
- 1... Ke5
    - 2. Nf7+ Kf6 (if Kd4, then Nf5+)

    - 2. Nf5+ Kc3

**Calculation of c4b6:**
- Not forcing.

**Calculation of c4a5:**
- Not forcing.

**Calculation of a1d1:**
- Not forcing.

**Best move:**
- c4d6+ is a forcing check, and after Kd4, Nf5+ wins the bishop on f3, or after Ke5, Nf7+ is very strong.

**Final move:**

2025-06-22 00:32:41,028 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 11.82s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- White: King on e1, knight on d6, rook on a1, rook on h1, pawns on a2, c2, f2, g2, h2, bishop on f1.
- Black: King on f4, bishop on f3, knight on a6, pawns on a7, c5, d5, g7, h7.

**Material:**
- White: Up the exchange (rook for knight), but Black has a dangerous bishop and active king.
- Black: King is very active, but White's knight is strong on d6.

**Threats:**
- Black's king is centralized and could be dangerous if not checked.
- White's knight on d6 is very strong, attacking e4 and f5 squares.
- White's rook on a1 is not active yet, but could swing to the kingside.
- Black's bishop on f3 is strong, but not attacking anything critical at the moment.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **d6e8**: Knight to e8, attacking g7 and possibly heading to f6.
2. **d6c8**: Knight to c8, not very active.
3. **d6f7**: Knight to f7, forking bishop and threatening g5+.
4. **d6b7**: Knight to b7, not active.
5. **d6f5**: Knight to f5, check, but Black can play Kxe4.
6. **d6b5**: Knight to b5, not active.
7. **d6e4**: Knight to e4, attacking bishop, but bishop can move.
8. **d6c4**: Knight to c4, not active.
9. **g1h3**: Rook to h3, attacking bishop.
10. **g1f3**: Rook to f3, attacking bishop.
11. **g1e2**: Rook to e2, defending.
12. **e1d2**: King to d2, centralizing.
13. **e1f1**: King to f1, not necessary.
14. **a1d1**: Rook to d1, centralizing.
15. **g2f3**: Pawn takes bishop, but there is no pawn on g2 that can take on f3.
16. **h2h3**: Pawn to h3, not urgent.
17. **g2g3**: Pawn to g3, attacking the king.
18. **c2c3**: Pawn to c3, defending d4.
19. **a2a3**: Pawn to a3, not urgent.
20. **h2h4**: Pawn to h4, not urgent.
21. **g2g4**: Pawn to g4, attacking the king.
22. **c2c4**: Pawn to c4, attacking d5.
23. **a2a4**: Pawn to a4, not urgent.

**Critical Tactical Considerations:**
- **Knight f7**: If 33. Nd6-f7, threatening Nxh8, but bishop on f3 is hanging.
- **Knight f5+**: 33. Nf5+ Kxf5, but then White loses the knight.
- **g3**: 33. g3+ Kg4, but then White can play h3+ and drive the king away.
- **Rook h3**: 33. Rh3, attacking bishop, but bishop can move.

**Best Move Analysis:**
- **g3+**: 33. g3+ forces the Black king to move. If 33...Kg4, then 34. h3+ Kf5 35. Bd3+ Be4 36. Bxe4+ dxe4 and White is up material and can consolidate.
- **g4+**: 33. g4+ Kxg4 34. Rg1+ Kh3 35. Rg3+ Kxh2 36. Rxf3 and White wins the bishop.
- **Rook f3**: 33. Rf3+ Kg4 34. h3+ Kf4 35. Bd3 and White is winning.

But **g4+** is a forcing move that wins the bishop after Rg1+.

**Calculation:**
33. g4+ Kxg4 (forced)
34. Rg1+ Kh3 (forced)
35. Rg3+ Kxh2 (forced)
36. Rxf3 and White wins the bishop.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g2g4
```

2025-06-22 00:33:36,164 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.78s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, rook on a1, knight on d6, pawns on a2, c2, f2, g4, h2
- Black: King on f4, bishop on f3, knight on c7, pawns on a7, c6, d5, g7, h7

**Key features:**
- Black's king is exposed on f4.
- White's knight on d6 is very strong, controlling key squares.
- Black's bishop on f3 is powerful, but White's king is relatively safe.
- White has a rook, Black does not.
- Black's knight is on c7, not very active.
- White's rook can become active quickly.

**Immediate tactics:**
- The Black king is on f4, and White can consider attacking it.
- The knight can jump to f5 with check, but the king can go to g5 or g4.
- The move g4-g5+ is possible, but Black can play Kxg5.
- The move a1d1 threatens to invade on the d-file, but there is no immediate threat.
- The move d6f5+ is a check, and after Kxg4, Ne3+ is possible, but the king can escape.
- The move d6e8 attacks the knight on c7, but it's not urgent.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d6f5+ (check)
2. a1d1 (activate rook)
3. g4g5+ (check)
4. h2h3 (preparing h4)
5. d6e8 (attack knight)
6. c2c3 (solidify center)

Let's analyze d6f5+:

1. d6f5+ Kxg4 (forced)
2. Ne3+ Kf4 (back)
3. Rg1 (threatening mate on g4) but Black can play g5.

Alternatively, after d6f5+ Kxg4, h3+ is possible, but after Kf4, Ne3 is check, but the king can go to e5.

Is there a forced win? Let's check:

1. d6f5+ Kxg4
2. h3+ Kf4
3. Ne3 (check) Ke5
4. Rg1 (threatening mate) Ne6 (blocking)
5. h4 (threatening g5#) g5
6. hxg5 Nxg5
7. Rxg5+ Kf4

No forced mate, but White is pressing.

Alternatively, let's consider a1d1:

1. a1d1 (threatening Rd4, pinning the bishop and king)
If Black plays Bxg4, then Rd4+ wins the bishop.

So, a1d1 threatens to win the bishop with Rd4+.

Let's check if Black can defend:

1. a1d1 Bxg4
2. Rd4+ Kg5 (only move)
3. h4+ Kf6
4. Rxg4

White wins a piece.

Therefore, a1d1 is a strong move, threatening to win the bishop.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play a1d1, threatening to win the bishop with Rd4+.

```
a1d1

2025-06-22 00:34:19,231 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.08s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (d1), King (e1), Knight (d6), Rook (h1), pawns (a2, c2, f2, g4, h2)
- Black: King (f4), Bishop (f3), Knight (c7), pawns (a7, c6, d5, g6, h7)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on f4.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Tactics:**
- White's knight on d6 is very strong, attacking key squares.
- Black's bishop on f3 is powerful, but White can try to attack the Black king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6e8**: Knight to e8, attacking the bishop and threatening to fork.
2. **d6f7**: Knight to f7, forking king and bishop, but the king can take.
3. **d6f5**: Knight to f5+, check, but king can go to g5 or e4.
4. **g4g5**: Pawn push, attacking the king, but king can go to g5.
5. **d1d4+**: Rook check, king can go to g5 or e5.
6. **g1h3**: Threatening knight to g5 with check.
7. **h2h3**: Preparing to drive the king away.

**Deep calculation:**

- **d1d4+**: If ...Kg5, then h4+ is possible, driving the king further. If ...Ke5, then Nf7+ forks king and bishop.
- **d6f5+**: If ...gxf5, then Nxf3, but that loses material.
- **g4g5+**: If ...Kxg5, then Nf7+ forks king and bishop.
- **d6f7+**: Kxg4, then h3+.

But **d1d4+** looks very strong, as it forces the king to move and allows for follow-up checks and attacks.

Let's check **d1d4+**:
- 1. Rd4+ Kg5 (if ...Ke5, then Nf7+ wins the bishop)
- 2. h4+ Kf6 (if ...Kh4, then Nxf3#)
- 3. Nxf3#

So, **d1d4+** leads to a forced mate or decisive material win.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d1d4
```

2025-06-22 00:34:49,608 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.82s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (White to move):**
- White: King e1, Rook d4, Knight d6, Bishop h1, Pawns a2, c2, f2, g4, h2
- Black: King e5, Rook (none), Knight c7, Bishop f3, Pawns a7, c6, g6, h7, f7

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Knight, 5 pawns
- Black: Knight, Bishop, 5 pawns

**Key factors:**
- White is up the exchange (Rook for Bishop).
- Black's king is centralized but exposed.
- White's knight on d6 is very powerful, controlling key squares.
- White's rook on d4 is active.
- Black's bishop on f3 is strong, but White's pieces coordinate well.
- White has a passed pawn on the kingside (potential for g4-g5).
- Black's knight on c7 is passive.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6f7+** (Knight check): King must move, but after ...Ke6, White can play Ng5+ and harass the king.
2. **d4d3** (Rook swing): Prepares Rd7, but not urgent.
3. **g4g5** (Pawn push): Gains space, but doesn't threaten immediately.
4. **d6e8** (Knight to e8): Attacks f6, but not as forcing.
5. **d4d5+** (Rook check): King moves, but then what?
6. **d6e4** (Knight to e4): Attacks bishop, but bishop can move.
7. **g1h3** (Activate bishop): Not urgent.

**Tactical checks:**
- **d6f7+**: If ...Ke6, then Ng5+ forks king and bishop, winning material.
- **d6f7+ Ke6, Ng5+ Kf5, Nxf3**: White wins a piece (bishop on f3).

**Calculation:**
1. d6f7+ Ke6 (forced)
2. Ng5+ Kf5 (forced, as Kd5 runs into c4+)
3. Nxf3 Kxg4
4. Ne5+ (forks king and bishop if bishop is still there)
But after Nxf3, White is up a full rook for a knight and should win easily.

**Conclusion:**  
**d6f7+** is a strong tactical move, winning the bishop and simplifying to a winning endgame.

My move:
```
d6f7
```

2025-06-22 00:35:41,499 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.76s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (d4), Knight (f7), Bishop (none), King (e1), pawns (a2, c2, f2, g4, h2)
- Black: Rook (none), Knight (c7), Bishop (f3), King (f6), pawns (a7, c6, d5, h7)

**Key points:**
- White is up a rook for a knight.
- Black's king is exposed on f6.
- White's knight on f7 is very powerful, attacking h8 and g5.
- White's rook is active on d4.
- Black's bishop on f3 is strong, but White's king is safe for now.
- White has a kingside pawn majority.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f7h8**: Knight to h8, attacking g6 and threatening to come to f7/g6.
2. **d4f4**: Rook to f4, threatening to exchange and possibly invade.
3. **g4g5+**: Pawn check, forcing the king to move.
4. **d4d5+**: Rook check, but Black can block with the knight or bishop.
5. **h2h4**: Preparing to push g5.
6. **g1h3**: Developing the rook.

**Tactical considerations:**
- **g4g5+**: If ...Kf5, then Nh6+ forks king and bishop. If ...Kxg5, White can play h4+ and the king is exposed.
- **d4f4+**: Forces an exchange, but White's rook is more valuable than Black's bishop.
- **f7h8**: The knight is not doing much on h8, but it could come to g6.

**Calculation:**
- **g4g5+**:
    - ...Kf5: Nh6+ forks king and bishop, winning the bishop.
    - ...Kxg5: h4+ and the king is exposed, White can attack with rook and knight.
    - ...Kg7: White can play h4, threatening h5.

- **d4d5+**: Black can block with the knight (c7) or bishop (f3), not as forcing.

- **d4f4+**: If ...gxf4, White loses the rook for a pawn.

- **f7h8**: Not immediately threatening.

**Best move:**
**g4g5+** is the most forcing, as it immediately attacks the king and can win material or expose the king further.

**Final move:**

2025-06-22 00:36:08,337 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.11s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after Black's last move (Ke7):**

- White: King e1, Rook d4, Knight f7, Bishop g1, Pawns a2, c2, f2, h2, g5
- Black: King e7, Rook (none), Knight c7, Bishop f3, Pawns a7, c6, d5, g6, h7

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Knight, Bishop, 5 pawns
- Black: Knight, Bishop, 5 pawns

**Immediate threats and opportunities:**
- White's knight on f7 is very strong, attacking both d8 and h8, and covering key squares.
- Black's king is exposed on e7.
- Black's bishop on f3 is strong, but not attacking anything immediate.
- White's rook on d4 is active, can swing to the kingside or attack along the d-file.
- White's bishop on g1 is undeveloped but can join the game soon.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f7h8**: Knight to h8, attacks g6 pawn, but knight is on the rim and not threatening much.
2. **d4d5**: Rook to d5, check. Black can play cxd5 or Nxd5, but both lose material.
3. **d4h4**: Rook swings to h4, attacking h7.
4. **d4g4**: Rook to g4, attacks g6 pawn.
5. **d4f4**: Rook to f4, attacks f3 bishop.
6. **g1h3**: Bishop to h3, attacks f3 bishop.

Let's analyze the most forcing move: **d4d5+**.

- If Black plays cxd5, then Nxd5+ forks king and bishop, winning material.
- If Black plays Nxd5, then Nxd5+ again, forking king and bishop.
- If Black plays Ke6, then Nxh8, White wins a pawn and keeps the initiative.
- If Black plays Kf8, then Nxh8, White wins a pawn.

So, **d4d5+** is a strong move, forcing Black to make a decision and likely winning material.

**Other moves:**
- f7h8 is not as strong.
- d4h4 or d4g4 are not as forcing as d4d5+.

**Conclusion:** The best move is the forcing check, **d4d5+**, which wins material.

My move:
```
d4d5
```

2025-06-22 00:36:33,296 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.94s):
Let's analyze the position:

**White:** King e1, Rook d5, Knight f7, Rook h1, Knight g1, pawns a2, c2, f2, g5, h2  
**Black:** King f8, Bishop f3, Knight c7, pawns a7, c6, g6, h7

**Material:**  
White: 2 rooks, 2 knights, 5 pawns  
Black: 1 bishop, 1 knight, 5 pawns

White is up a full rook for a bishop, and the knight on f7 is very strong, attacking h8 and d8. Black's king is boxed in on f8, and the bishop on f3 is not well placed to defend.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can play Nh6, threatening Rd8# (mate).
- The rook on d5 can swing to d8 or d7, but the knight on c7 covers d8.
- The move Nh6+ is a forcing check, and if ...Kg7, then Rd7 is mate.

Let's check the candidate moves:

1. **f7h6+**  
   - If ...Ke7, then Rd7#.
   - If ...Kg7, then Rd7#.
   - If ...Ke8, then Rd8#.
   - If ...Kg8, then Rd8#.
   - If ...Bxh1, then Rd8#.

So, **Nh6+** is a forcing move that leads to mate next move, as Black cannot stop Rd8#.

**Final move:**
```
f7h6

2025-06-22 00:37:07,234 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.00s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Rook (h1), Knight (h6), Pawns (a2, c2, f2, g5, h2)
- Black: King (f8), Bishop (f3), Knight (d5), Pawns (a7, d5, g6, h7)

**Key factors:**
- White is up the exchange (rook for bishop).
- White's knight on h6 is very active and threatens to invade.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed, but White's rook is not yet active.
- Black's bishop on f3 is strong, but White's knight can harass.
- White's king is safe for now.
- Black's knight on d5 is centralized.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h6g8: Knight to g8, but this retreats and does not threaten anything.
2. h6f7: Knight to f7, forking king and bishop! This is a check, and after ...Kxf7, White can play Rxh7+, winning a pawn and activating the rook.
3. h6f5: Knight to f5, attacks bishop, but bishop can move.
4. h6g4: Knight to g4, attacks bishop, but not as strong as f7.
5. g1h3: Develop rook, but less urgent than tactical shots.
6. h2h3, h2h4: Pawn moves, not urgent.
7. c2c3, c2c4: Pawn moves, not urgent.
8. a2a3, a2a4: Pawn moves, not urgent.

**Tactical calculation:**
- h6f7+ is a fork.
  - If ...Kxf7, then Rxh7+ wins a pawn and activates the rook.
  - If ...Ke7, then Nxd8 wins the knight.
  - If ...Kg8, then Nh6 threatens mate ideas and attacks the bishop.

**Let's check h6f7+:**
- 1. Nf7+ Kxf7 (forced)
- 2. Rxh7+ Ke6 (if ...Kg8, Rh8# is mate)
- 3. Nh6 threatens mate on h8, but Black can defend with ...Bh5 or ...Ne7.

Alternatively, after 1. Nf7+ Ke7, 2. Nxd8 wins the knight.

**Conclusion:**
- 1. Nf7+ is a powerful fork, winning material or giving a strong attack.

**Final move:**
```
h6f7

2025-06-22 00:37:30,422 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.82s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, Knight on f7, Rook on h1, pawns on a2, c2, f2, g5, h2
- Black: King on f8, Bishop on d1, Knight on c7, pawns on a7, d5, g6, h7

**Key points:**
- White is up the exchange (Rook for Bishop), and has an active knight on f7.
- Black's king is boxed in on f8, with limited mobility.
- Black's bishop on d1 is active, but not threatening immediate tactics.
- White's rook on h1 is not yet active, but can swing into play.
- White's knight on f7 is very strong, attacking h8 and d8, and covering key squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f7h8**: Knight to h8. This is a check, but Black can play Kg8, and the knight is trapped.
2. **f7d8**: Knight to d8. Attacks the bishop, but the bishop can move.
3. **f7h6**: Knight to h6. Not threatening much.
4. **f7d6**: Knight to d6. Attacks the bishop, but not much else.
5. **f7e5**: Knight to e5. Centralizes, but not a threat.
6. **g1h3**: Rook to h3. Prepares to swing the rook to the kingside.
7. **g1f3**: Rook to f3. Prepares to double on the f-file or swing to the 7th rank.
8. **g1e2**: Rook to e2. Not very active.
9. **e1d2/f1/d1**: King moves, not urgent.
10. **h2h3/h4**: Pawn moves, not urgent.
11. **f2f3/f4**: Pawn moves, not urgent.
12. **c2c3/c4**: Pawn moves, not urgent.
13. **a2a3/a4**: Pawn moves, not urgent.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The knight on f7 is very strong, but moving it away loses pressure.
- The rook on h1 can be activated via h3 or f3.
- Black's king is restricted, but not in immediate danger of mate.
- Black's bishop on d1 is loose.

**Best plan:**
- Activate the rook, ideally to the 7th rank or to attack Black's pawns.
- Avoid unnecessary exchanges unless they increase the advantage.
- Keep the knight on f7 for now, as it restricts Black's king.

**Best move:**
- **g1h3**: Rook to h3. This prepares Rh3-f3, attacking f7 and possibly swinging to the 7th rank. It also keeps the pressure and improves White's piece activity.

Therefore, my move is:
```
g1h3
```

2025-06-22 00:37:50,103 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.84s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5k2/2n2N1p/6p1/p2p2P1/8/7N/P1P2P1P/3bK2R w K - 0 42

**White:** King e1, Rook h1, Knight f7, Knight h3, Pawns a2, c2, f2, g5, h2  
**Black:** King f8, Bishop d1, Knight c7, Pawns a5, d5, g6, h7

**Material:**  
White: Rook, 2 Knights, 5 Pawns  
Black: Bishop, Knight, 5 Pawns

**Key features:**
- White's knight on f7 is very strong, attacking d8 and h8.
- Black's king is boxed in on f8.
- Black's bishop on d1 is awkward, but controls e2 and f3.
- White's rook on h1 is ready to swing.
- Black's knight on c7 is not very active.
- White's knight on h3 can jump to f4 or g1.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White has a potential checkmate threat with Nh6-f7-h8, but Black's king can escape via g7 if not careful.
- White can consider bringing the rook to h7 or h8.
- Black's king is very restricted.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nh3-f4**: Brings the knight to a more active square, eyes d5 and e6, but doesn't threaten mate.
2. **Rh1-h7**: Threatens mate on h8, but Black can play Bxc2, attacking the rook and threatening to promote the a-pawn.
3. **Rh1-h8**: Immediate check, but Black plays Kxf7 and escapes.
4. **f2-f4**: Opens the f-file, but doesn't create an immediate threat.
5. **c2-c3**: Defends d4, but not urgent.
6. **a2-a4**: Not urgent.

**Tactical check:**
- If 1. Rh1-h7, Black cannot play Kg8 (illegal), and if 1...Bxc2, then 2. Nh6 threatens mate on f7 and g8.
- If 1. Nh3-f4, Black has no immediate threats.

**Deep calculation:**
- 1. Rh1-h7 Bxc2 (attacking the rook)
- 2. Nh6 (threatening mate on f7)
- If Black plays Ne6, then 3. Rf7# is mate.
- If Black plays d4, then 3. Rf7# is still mate.
- If Black plays Ne8, then 3. Rf7# is mate.

But after 1. Rh1-h7, Black cannot stop Rf7#.

**Conclusion:**  
1. **Rh1-h7** is a direct threat. Black cannot prevent Rf7# on the next move.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h1h7
```
2025-06-22 00:37:50,103 - WARNING - Illegal move: h1h7 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one. Note that we have give you all legal moves.

2025-06-22 00:37:56,177 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.07s):
Thank you for pointing out the error and providing the legal moves. Let's carefully reconsider the position and the legal options:

**Legal moves:**
- f7h8
- f7d8
- f7h6
- f7d6
- f7e5
- h3f4
- h3g1
- h1g1
- h1f1
- e1d2
- e1f1
- e1d1
- e1g1
- f2f3
- c2c3
- a2a3
- f2f4
- c2c4
- a2a4

**Position analysis:**
- White's knight on f7 is very strong, and the Black king is boxed in on f8.
- Black's bishop on d1 is awkward, but controls some squares.
- White's rook is on h1, king on e1, knight on h3.
- Black's knight is on c7, pawns on a5, d5, g6, h7.

**Key tactical ideas:**
- The Black king is stuck on f8, and White's knight on f7 is controlling key escape squares.
- White's rook can potentially swing to the f-file, but currently blocked by the king.
- White's knight on h3 can jump to f4, attacking d5 and g6.
- Advancing the f-pawn (f2-f3 or f2-f4) could allow the king to move and the rook to swing to the f-file, threatening mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f2-f3**: Prepares to move the king and bring the rook to the f-file.
2. **f2-f4**: More aggressive, but weakens e4 and e3.
3. **h3-f4**: Brings the knight to a more active square, attacks d5 and g6.
4. **e1-f1**: Prepares to bring the rook to the f-file.
5. **f7-h8**: Moves the knight to the corner, but doesn't seem to threaten anything.
6. **f7-e5**: Centralizes the knight, attacks d3 and g6.

**Deeper look:**
- After **f2-f3**, White can play Kf2 and Rxd1, then swing the rook to the f-file, threatening mate.
- After **h3-f4**, White attacks d5 and g6, but doesn't create an immediate threat.
- **e1-f1** is a preparatory move, but f2-f3 is more flexible.

**Best move:**
**f2-f3** is the most flexible and prepares to bring the king to f2, then the rook to the f-file, threatening mate. It also keeps all options open and doesn't weaken the position.

Therefore, my move is:
```
f2f3
```

2025-06-22 00:38:17,616 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.97s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King on e1, rook on h1, knight on f7 and h3, pawns on a2, c2, f3, g5, h2
- Black: King on f8, bishop on d1, knight on c7, pawns on a5, d5, g6, h5

**Key features:**
- White is up material: two knights and a rook vs bishop and knight.
- Black's king is exposed on f8.
- White's knight on f7 is very strong, controlling key squares.
- White's knight on h3 is not doing much but can be repositioned.
- White's rook on h1 is ready to swing into action.
- White has a pawn on g5, threatening g5-g6 or g5xh6.
- Black's bishop on d1 is awkwardly placed.
- Black's knight on c7 is not very active.
- Black's king has few escape squares.

**Immediate threats and tactics:**
- The move g5h6 (gxh6) is possible, capturing a pawn and threatening to push h7.
- The move f7h8+ (Nxh8+) is a check, but after ...Kg7, the knight is trapped.
- The move f7d8 attacks the bishop, but the bishop is defended by the knight.
- The move f7e5 is interesting, centralizing the knight and threatening forks.
- The move h3f4 brings the knight into play, possibly to g6 or e6.
- The move h1g1 brings the rook to the open file, possibly threatening Rg7+ in the future.
- The move f3f4 supports the g5 pawn and prepares to open the f-file.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g5h6 (gxh6): Captures a pawn, threatens to push h7, but does it give Black counterplay?
2. h1g1: Puts the rook on the open file, possibly preparing Rg7+.
3. h3f4: Brings the knight into play, possibly to g6 or e6.
4. f7e5: Centralizes the knight, threatens forks.
5. f3f4: Supports the g5 pawn, prepares to open the f-file.

**Let's analyze gxh6:**
- gxh6
  - If ...Bxc2, White can play h7, threatening h8=Q.
  - If ...Bxf3, White can play h7, and after ...Kg7, h8=Q+.
  - Black has no immediate threats.

**Let's analyze h1g1:**
- h1g1
  - Prepares Rg7, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.

**Let's analyze h3f4:**
- h3f4
  - Prepares Nxg6+, but not an immediate threat.

**Let's analyze f7e5:**
- f7e5
  - Centralizes the knight, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.

**Let's analyze f3f4:**
- f3f4
  - Supports g5, but not an immediate threat.

**Best move:**
gxh6 is the most forcing and creates a dangerous passed pawn. Black cannot stop h7 and h8=Q easily. The bishop is awkward, and White's pieces are ready to support the pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g5h6
```

2025-06-22 00:38:54,538 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.38s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Rook (h1), Knights (f7, h3), Pawns (a2, c2, f3, h6, h2)
- Black: King (f8), Bishop (d1), Pawns (a5, d5, g6)

**Key features:**
- White is up a rook for a bishop and has two advanced pawns (h6 and f3).
- Black's king is somewhat boxed in, and White's pieces are very active.
- White has a rook on h1 and a knight on f7, both eyeing the kingside.
- The h6 pawn is one step from queening, but Black's bishop on d1 controls h5 and could try to stop it.
- Black's bishop is far from the kingside action.

**Immediate threats and tactics:**
- The move h6h7 threatens to promote, but Black can play Kxf7 after h7.
- The move f7h8+ is a check, forcing the king to g8 or e7.
- The move h3g5 threatens Ne6+ or f7e5+ ideas.
- The move f7d8+ is a check, but after Kf7, White has no immediate follow-up.
- The move f7g5 attacks the bishop on d1 and threatens Ne6+.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f7h8+**: Check. If Kf7, then h6h7 is very strong.
2. **h6h7**: Threatens to promote, but Black can play Kxf7.
3. **f7g5**: Attacks the bishop, but bishop can move.
4. **h3g5**: Brings another piece into the attack.
5. **f7e5**: Centralizes the knight, but not as forcing.

Let's calculate **f7h8+**:
- 1. Nf7-h8+ Kf8-g8 (only move)
- Now, h6h7 is coming, and the king is cut off from the h-file. Black cannot stop h7-h8=Q easily.

Alternatively, after **f7h8+ Kf8-g8**, White can play h6h7, threatening h8=Q. Black cannot stop it with the bishop, and the king cannot approach.

Let's check for any defense:
- After 1. Nf7-h8+ Kg8, 2. h6-h7+ Kxh7 is not possible because the king is on g8, not f7.
- Black cannot stop h8=Q.

Therefore, **f7h8+** is a forced win.

My move:
```
f7h8
```

2025-06-22 00:39:50,421 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.81s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** n6N/4k3/6pP/p2p4/8/5P1N/P1P4P/3bK2R w K - 3 45

**White:** King e1, Rook h1, Knight h3, Knight h8, Knight h6, Pawn a2, c2, f3, h6, h7, h8  
**Black:** King e7, Bishop d1, Pawn a5, d5, g6

**Material:**  
- White: Rook, 3 Knights, 5 Pawns  
- Black: Bishop, 3 Pawns

**Key points:**
- Black's bishop is on d1, controlling some squares.
- Black's king is on e7, somewhat exposed.
- White has a rook on h1 and a knight on h8, both near the Black king.
- White has a knight on h3, which can jump to f4 or g5, potentially threatening checks or attacks.
- White's h6 pawn is advanced and could promote soon.
- Black's only minor piece is the bishop, which is not well placed for defense.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h8f7+ (Knight check, forces king to f8 or e8)
2. h8g6+ (Knight check, king must move)
3. h6h7 (advance pawn, but not urgent)
4. h3g5 (bring knight closer to action)
5. h1g1 (rook to open file)
6. e1f2 (king to safety)

**Analysis:**

- **h8f7+**: Knight check. If Kxf7, then h6h7, and the pawn is unstoppable. If Ke8, then h6h7, and the pawn is unstoppable.
- **h8g6+**: Knight check. If Kf7, then h6h7, and again the pawn is unstoppable.
- **h6h7**: Advance pawn, but Black can play Bxf3, but then h7h8=Q.
- **h3g5**: Develops knight, but not urgent.

**Let's calculate h8f7+:**
- 1. Nh8-f7+ Ke7-e8 (only move)
- 2. h6-h7 (threatening h7-h8=Q)
- Black cannot stop promotion. If Bxf3, then h7-h8=Q.

Alternatively, **h8g6+**:
- 1. Nh8-g6+ Ke7-f7 (only move)
- 2. h6-h7, again threatening h7-h8=Q.

But **h8f7+** is more forcing, as it pushes the king to the back rank.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play **h8f7+**, forcing the Black king to the back rank and clearing the way for pawn promotion.

My move:
```
h8f7
```

2025-06-22 00:41:04,598 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.48s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** n7/4kN2/6pP/p2p4/8/5b1N/P1P4P/4K2R w K - 0 46

**White:** King e1, Rook h1, Knight f7, Knight h3, Knight h6, Pawn h7, Pawn c2, Pawn a2  
**Black:** King e7, Bishop f3, Pawn a5, Pawn d5, Pawn g6, Knight a8

**Material:**  
White: Rook, 3 Knights, 3 Pawns  
Black: Bishop, Knight, 3 Pawns

**Key features:**
- White has a pawn on h7, one step from queening.
- Black's king is on e7, somewhat exposed.
- Black's bishop on f3 covers the h1 square, so h8=Q is not immediately possible.
- White's knight on f7 attacks e5, d6, h8, and g5.
- White's knight on h6 supports h7 and covers f7, g8, f5.
- White's knight on h3 is not very active but can be repositioned.
- White's rook on h1 is on an open file, but the h8 square is covered by the bishop.

**Immediate tactical ideas:**
- h7-h8=Q is not possible due to the bishop on f3.
- The Black king is not in immediate danger of mate, but is somewhat exposed.
- White's knight on f7 can go to h8, d6, g5, or e5.
- White's knight on h3 can go to g5, f4, f2, or g1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h6-h7: Push the pawn, but it is already on h7.
2. f7-h8: Move the knight to h8, but it doesn't threaten much.
3. h3-g5: Bring the knight to a more active square, attacking f3 and e6.
4. h1-g1: Rook to g1, but doesn't threaten much.
5. e1-f2: King to f2, but not urgent.
6. c2-c3: Prepare to expand on the queenside.
7. f7-g5: Knight to g5, attacking f3 and e6.
8. h3-f4: Knight to f4, attacking d5 and g6.

**Critical lines:**
- If White plays h7-h8=Q, Black simply captures with Bxh8.
- If White plays f7-g5, threatening Nxf3, Black can play Bxg4 or Bxg5.
- If White plays h3-g5, threatening Nxf3, Black can respond with Bxg4 or Bxg5.
- If White plays f7-d6, check, Black can play Kxd6.

**Best plan:**
- White's h7 pawn is a huge asset, but can't queen yet.
- The bishop on f3 is the only thing stopping the pawn from queening.
- If White can remove the bishop from f3, h8=Q will be unstoppable.
- The knight on h3 can go to g5, attacking f3.
- The knight on f7 can go to g5, also attacking f3.
- If both knights attack f3, Black cannot defend it with another piece.

**Calculate h3-g5:**
1. h3-g5 (threatening Nxf3+)
   - If Bxg4, then Nxg4, and the bishop is gone.
   - If Bxh1, then Nxf3, and h8=Q is coming.
   - If Bg4, then Nxf3, and h8=Q is coming.

**Calculate f7-g5:**
1. f7-g5 (threatening Nxf3+)
   - If Bxg4, then Nxg4, and the bishop is gone.
   - If Bxh1, then Nxf3, and h8=Q is coming.

**Which knight to g5?**
- h3-g5 develops the less active knight.
- f7-g5 leaves the f7 knight, which is more central.

**Check for checks:**
- f7-d6+ is possible, but after Kxd6, nothing is gained.

**Check for captures:**
- No immediate captures.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play h3-g5, bringing the knight to a more active square, threatening Nxf3, and preparing to remove the bishop so the pawn can queen.

**Final move:**
```
h3g5
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Rook (h1), Knight (g5, f7), Pawn (h6, a2, c2)
- Black: King (e7), Bishop (g2), Knight (a8), Pawn (a5, d5, g6, h4)

**Key features:**
- White has two knights and a rook for a bishop and a knight.
- White's h6 pawn is advanced and could be a potential asset.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed.
- White's knights are very active, especially f7 and g5.
- Black's bishop on g2 is active, but White's pieces coordinate well.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h6h7: Pushes the pawn, threatening to promote soon.
2. f7h8: Knight to the corner, but doesn't seem to threaten much.
3. g5h7: Knight attacks the bishop, but bishop can move.
4. g5e6: Knight check, but Black can move the king.
5. h1g1: Rook to open file, but doesn't seem urgent.
6. h6h7: Threatens h8=Q next move.

**Tactical ideas:**
- h6h7 is very strong, threatening h8=Q.
- If Black tries to stop the pawn with h3, White can play h7h8=Q, and if Bxh8, then Nxh8, White is up a piece.
- Black's king is cut off from the queenside and can't stop the pawn.

**Calculation:**
- 1. h6h7 h3 (trying to block) 2. h7h8=Q Bxh8 3. Nxh8, White is up a piece.
- 1. h6h7 Kf6 (trying to get closer) 2. h7h8=Q Bxh8 3. Nxh8, again White is up a piece.

**Conclusion:**
- h6h7 is the most direct and powerful move, threatening to promote and win material.

My move:
```
h6h7

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Knights (f7, g5), Pawn (h7, a2, c2), Rook (h1)
- Black: King (d7), Knight (a8), Bishop (g2), Pawns (a5, d5, g6)

**White to move.**

**Key Points:**
- The h7 pawn is one step from promotion, and Black cannot stop it directly.
- Black's king is far from the h-file.
- Black's bishop on g2 covers h1 and f3, but not h8.
- Black's knight on a8 is out of play.
- White has a rook on h1, which can support the promotion if needed.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. h7-h8=Q (promote to queen)
2. h7-h8=N (promote to knight, but less effective here)
3. h7-h8=R/B (underpromotions, but queen is best)
4. Other knight moves (but promotion is urgent)
5. Rook moves (not urgent)
6. King moves (not urgent)

- After h7-h8=Q, Black can try to attack the new queen, but White will have overwhelming material.
- There are no immediate threats from Black.
- Underpromotion to a queen is safe, as Black cannot checkmate or force a draw.

**Check for stalemate:**
- Black's king has moves (d7, c7, c8, e7, e8), so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

2025-06-22 00:42:59,504 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.13s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** n6Q/3k1N2/6p1/p2p2N1/8/8/P1P4P/4Kb1R w K - 1 49

- White: King e1, Rook h1, Knight f7, Knight g5, Knight h8, Queen h8, pawns a2, c2, h2
- Black: King d7, Bishop f1, pawn a5, d5, g6, knight a8

**Material:** White is up a queen, three knights, and a rook for a bishop and a knight. White is overwhelmingly ahead.

**Tactical Motifs:**
- Black's king is exposed on d7.
- White has a queen on h8 and a knight on f7, both near the Black king.
- Black's bishop is on f1, but can't defend the king.
- White's knight on g5 can jump to e6, e4, or h7.
- White's rook on h1 can swing to the g-file or f-file.

**Immediate threats:**
- White can deliver checks with the queen or knight.
- Is there a forced mate?

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qd8+ (h8d8): Queen check, king must move.
2. Ne5+ (g5e5): Knight check, king must move.
3. Qh3: Queen swing, but not a check.
4. Qg7: Queen swing, not a check.
5. Nf6: Knight move, not a check.

Let's check Qd8+:

**1. Qd8+**
- Black's only legal move is Kc6 (since c8 is covered by the queen, c7 by the knight on f7, e7 by the knight on f7, and e8 by the queen).
- After Kc6, White can play Ne5+ (g5e5) or Qxa8.

But let's check if there is a forced mate.

**1. Qd8+ Kc6**
- 2. Ne5+ (g5e5) Kb5 (only move)
- 3. Qxa8 (h8a8) - wins the knight, but not mate.
- Alternatively, 2. Qxa8+ Kb5, no immediate mate.

Alternatively, let's check Ne5+:

**1. Ne5+ (g5e5)**
- Black's king can go to e7 or c7.
- 1... Ke7: 2. Qg7+ (h8g7) is mate (since f7 knight covers f7, e6, g6, and g5 knight covers f7, f5, e4, etc.)
- 1... Kc7: 2. Qg7+ (h8g7) is mate (same as above).

So, **Ne5+** is a forced mate in 2!

**Final move:**
```
g5e5
```
2025-06-22 00:42:59,504 - WARNING - Illegal move: g5e5 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one. Note that we have give you all legal moves.

2025-06-22 00:43:04,928 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.42s):
Thank you for your patience and for providing the list of legal moves. Let's re-evaluate the position with the legal moves in mind.

**Legal moves:**
h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8, h8h7, h8g7, h8h6, h8f6, h8h5, h8e5, h8h4, h8d4, h8h3, h8c3, h8b2, h8a1, f7d8, f7h6, f7d6, f7e5, g5h7, g5e6, g5e4, g5h3, g5f3, h1g1, h1f1, e1f2, e1d2, e1f1, e1d1, h2h3, c2c3, a2a3, h2h4, c2c4, a2a4

Let's look for checks and mates:

**1. h8d8 (Qd8+)**
- Black's only legal move is Kc6.

**2. f7d8 (Nxd8+)**
- Black's only legal move is Kxd8.

**3. g5e6 (Ne6+)**
- Black's only legal move is Kc8.

**4. g5e4 (Ne4+)**
- Black's only legal move is dxe4.

**5. h8e8 (Qe8+)**
- Black's only legal move is Kc7.

Let's check h8d8 (Qd8+):

1. h8d8+ Kc6

Now, do we have a follow-up mate? Let's see:

- After Kc6, White can play Qxa8 (h8a8), winning the knight.
- Alternatively, is there a forced mate? Let's check.

Alternatively, let's check h8e8+ (Qe8+):

1. h8e8+ Kc7

Now, White can play Qxa8 (h8a8), but not mate.

Alternatively, let's check f7d8+ (Nxd8+):

1. f7d8+ Kxd8

Now, White can play Qf6+ (but that's not a legal move), or Qh4+, but that's not a legal move.

Alternatively, let's check g5e6+ (Ne6+):

1. g5e6+ Kc8

Now, White can play Qxa8 (h8a8), but not mate.

So, among all, h8d8+ seems to be the most forcing, as it puts the king on the edge and keeps the initiative.

**Final move:**
```
h8d8
```

2025-06-22 00:43:15,489 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.20s):
Let's analyze the position:

**White:** King on e1, Queen on d8, Knights on g5 and f7, Rook on h1, Pawns on a2, c2, h2  
**Black:** King on c6, Bishop on f1, Knight on a8, Pawns on a5, d5, g6

- Material: White is up a queen and rook for a bishop and knight, and has two active knights and a queen deep in Black's position.
- Black's king is exposed on c6, with no pawn cover.
- White's queen on d8 controls many squares and can deliver checks.
- White's knights are very active, especially the one on f7.
- Black's bishop on f1 is not threatening immediate tactics.
- Black's knight on a8 is out of play.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- White can deliver checks with the queen: d8e8+, d8f6+, d8d6+, d8c7+, d8a5+.
- The queen can also move to d7, but that's not a check.
- The knight on f7 can check with f7d6+.
- The knight on g5 can check with g5e6+.

Let's check the most forcing moves: checks.

**Candidate 1: d8e8+**
- Black king can only go to b7 or c5.
- If Kc5, then Qe7+ is possible.
- If Kb7, then Qe7+ again.

**Candidate 2: d8f6+**
- Black king can go to c5 or b7.
- If Kc5, then Qe7+.
- If Kb7, then Qe7+.

**Candidate 3: d8d6+**
- Black king can go to b7 or b5.
- If Kb7, then Qd7+.
- If Kb5, then Qxd5+.

**Candidate 4: d8c7+**
- Black king can go to b5 or b7.
- If Kb5, then Qxd5+.
- If Kb7, then Qd7+.

**Candidate 5: d8a5+**
- Black king can go to b7 or d6.
- If Kb7, then Qd7+.
- If Kd6, then Qxa8.

**Candidate 6: f7d6+**
- Black king can go to c5 or b6.
- If Kc5, then Qc7+.
- If Kb6, then Qb8+.

**Candidate 7: g5e6+**
- Black king can go to b5 or b7.
- If Kb5, then Qxd5+.
- If Kb7, then Qd7+.

**Let's check for mate threats:**
- After d8e8+ Kc5, Qe7+ Kc4, Qe2+ Kc3, Qd2+ Kb2, Qb4+ Kxa1, Kd2 (threatening mate soon).
- After d8e8+ Kb7, Qe7+ Kb6, Qb8+ Kc5, Qe7+.

It seems that all these checks lead to a series of checks, but let's see if any of them are immediately decisive.

**Let's try d8e8+ (most forcing):**
1. Qe8+ Kc5 (Kb7 is similar)
2. Qe7+ Kc4
3. Qe2+ Kc3
4. Qd2+ Kb2
5. Qb4+ Kxa1
6. Kd2 (threatening mate soon)

But Black can keep running, but White is winning.

**Let's try d8c7+**
1. Qc7+ Kb5 (Kb7)
2. Qxd5+ (winning the pawn, king is still exposed)

**Let's try d8a5+**
1. Qa5+ Kd6 (Kb7)
2. Qxa8 (winning the knight)

But the king escapes.

**Let's try f7d6+**
1. Nd6+ Kc5
2. Qc7+ Kd4
3. Qc3#

This is checkmate!

**Final move:**
```
f7d6

2025-06-22 00:43:32,140 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.51s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**White:**
- King on e1
- Queen on d8
- Knights on d6 and g5
- Rook on h1
- Pawns on a2, c2, h2

**Black:**
- King on c6
- Bishop on f1
- Pawns on a4, d5, g6

**Immediate threats and opportunities:**
- Black's king is exposed on c6.
- White has a queen and two knights in the vicinity of Black's king.
- Black's bishop on f1 is not participating in the defense.
- White's queen on d8 is very active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d8e8+**: Queen check, but Black can block with the bishop (Bishop to e2).
2. **d8c8+**: Queen check, king must move to b6 or d7.
3. **d8a8+**: Queen check, king must move to b6.
4. **d8f6+**: Queen check, king must move to b7 or c5.
5. **g5e6**: Knight check, king must move.
6. **d6e8**: Knight check, king must move.
7. **g5f7**: Knight check, king must move.

Let's look for forced mates or decisive material gain.

**Check all checks:**

- **d8c8+**: King must move to b6 or d7.
    - If Kb6, then Qb7# is mate.
    - If Kd7, then Qd7# is mate.

- **d8a8+**: King must move to b6.
    - If Kb6, then Qb7# is mate.

- **d8f6+**: King must move to b7 or c5.
    - If Kb7, Qb7# is mate.
    - If Kc5, Qc3# is mate.

- **d8e8+**: Bishop can block on e2.

- **d8h8+**: No immediate mate.

**Let's check d8c8+:**
- 1. Qc8+ Kb6 (forced)
- 2. Qb7# (mate)

**Let's check d8a8+:**
- 1. Qa8+ Kb6 (forced)
- 2. Qb7# (mate)

**Let's check d8f6+:**
- 1. Qf6+ Kb7 (forced)
- 2. Qb7# (mate)
- 1. Qf6+ Kc5
- 2. Qc3# (mate)

**Let's check d8d7+:**
- 1. Qd7+ Kc5 (forced)
- 2. Qc3# (mate)

**Conclusion:**
All these queen checks lead to forced mate in two. Let's pick the most direct one.

**Move:**
```
d8c8

2025-06-22 00:43:41,925 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.23s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** n1Q5/8/3k2p1/3p2N1/p7/8/P1P4P/4Kb1R w K - 0 52

White:
- King on e1
- Queen on c8
- Knight on g5
- Pawn on a2, c2, h2
- Rook on h1

Black:
- King on d6
- Bishop on f1
- Knight on a8
- Pawns on a4, d5, g6

**Material:**
White: Q, R, N, 3P
Black: B, N, 3P

**King Safety:** Black's king is exposed on d6. White's queen is very active. White's rook and knight can join the attack. Black's bishop is far from the king, and the knight is on the rim.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- White's queen is on c8, eyeing the c-file and the 8th rank.
- The Black king is on d6, with limited escape squares.
- The knight on g5 can jump to e6 with check.
- The rook on h1 can swing to h6 or h7 after some preparation.
- The move c8e6+ is possible, forking the king and bishop.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **c8e6+**: Queen check, attacking the bishop on f1. If Kc5, Qe3+ wins the bishop. If Kc7, Qe7+ wins the bishop. If Kc5, Qe3+ is strong.
2. **g5f7+**: Knight check, but after Ke6, the knight is hanging.
3. **g5e6**: Knight check, but after Kxe6, White loses the knight.
4. **c8c3**: Queen check, but the king can go to e5.
5. **c8c5+**: Queen check, but the king can go to e5.
6. **c8a6+**: Queen check, but the king can go to c7.

**Let's calculate c8e6+:**
- 1. Qe6+ Kc5 (if Kc7, Qe7+ wins the bishop)
- 2. Qe3+ Kc6 (if Kb4, Qb6+)
- 3. Qc3+ Kb5
- 4. Qb2+ Kc4
- 5. Qb6 (threatening mate and picking up the a4 pawn)

Alternatively, after 1. Qe6+ Kc7, 2. Qe7+ Kb6, 3. Qb4+ Kc6, 4. Qb7+ Kd6, 5. Qb8+ Kc6, 6. Qxa8+ wins the knight.

**What about c8f8?**
- Threatens mate on f6, but Black can play Kc7.

**What about c8d8?**
- Threatens mate on d6, but Black can play Kc5.

**What about c8e6+?**
- This move wins the bishop and keeps the attack going.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play c8e6+, winning material and keeping the attack.

My move:
```
c8e6
```

- White: Queen (e6), Knight (g5), King (e1), Rook (h1), pawns (a2, c2, h2)
- Black: King (d5), Bishop (f1), Knight (a8), pawns (g6, a4)

**King Safety:**

1. **e6e4+**: Queen check on e4. Black king can go to d6, c4, or c6.
2. **e6d5+**: Queen check on d5. Black king can capture the queen with Kxd5.
3. **e6g8**: Queen moves to g8, threatening mate on g1, but not a check.
4. **e6g6**: Queen captures pawn on g6, not a check.
5. **g5f7**: Knight check on f7. Black king can move to c4 or c6.
6. **g5e4+**: Knight check on e4. Black king can go to c4 or c6.
7. **e6d7+**: Queen check on d7. Black king can go to c4 or c6.

Let's check the most forcing moves: **checks**.

### 1. e6e4+ (Queen check)
- If Kc4: White can play Qc4# (mate).
- If Kd6: White can play Qe6+ again, repeating.
- If Kc6: White can play Qc4# (mate).

### 2. g5e4+ (Knight check)
- If Kc4: Qc4# (mate).
- If Kc6: Qc4# (mate).
- If Kd4: Nf2# (mate).

### 3. g5f7+ (Knight check)
- If Kc4: Qc4# (mate).
- If Kc6: Qc4# (mate).
- If Kd4: Nf2# (mate).

### 4. e6d7+ (Queen check)
- If Kc4: Qc4# (mate).
- If Kc6: Qc4# (mate).
- If Kd4: Nf2# (mate).

### 5. e6e5+ (Queen check)
- If Kc4: Qc4# (mate).
- If Kc6: Qc4# (mate).
- If Kd6: Qe6+ (repeat).

### 6. e6c4 (Queen move, not check)
- Not forcing.

### 7. e6g8 (Queen move, not check)
- Not forcing.

### 8. e6g6 (Queen captures pawn, not check)
- Not forcing.

### 9. e6f5 (Queen move, not check)
- Not forcing.

### 10. e6d5+ (Queen check, but king captures queen)

### Conclusion:
All the queen and knight checks on e4, f7, d7, e5, and e4 lead to mate on c4 (Qc4#) if the king moves to c4 or c6, or Nf2# if the king moves to d4.

Let's check if there is a mate in one:

- If White plays **e6e4+** and Black plays Kc4, then Qc4#.
- If White plays **g5e4+** and Black plays Kc4, then Qc4#.
- If White plays **e6e4+**, Black cannot avoid mate next move.

But is there a mate in one? Let's check Qc4#:

- Can White play Qc4 immediately? No, the queen is on e6.

So, the best move is to check with the queen, forcing the king to c4 or c6, then mate with Qc4.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e6e4
```

2025-06-22 00:44:37,979 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.64s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** n7/8/6p1/2k3N1/p3p3/8/P1P4P/4Kb1R w K - 0 54

**White:** King on e1, Knight on g5, Rook on h1, pawns on a2, c2, h2  
**Black:** King on c5, Knight on a8, Bishop on f1, pawns on a4, e4, g6

**Material:**  
White: Rook, Knight, 3 pawns  
Black: Knight, Bishop, 3 pawns

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black's passed a-pawn is dangerous but not immediately queening.
- Black's e4 pawn is advanced but not supported.
- Black's bishop on f1 is not currently active.
- White's knight on g5 is active and can harass the Black king.
- White's rook on h1 is not yet active but can swing to the kingside or center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g5h7 — Knight to h7, attacks f8 and g5 squares, but not very active.
2. g5f7 — Knight to f7, attacks e5, d6, h6, and g5, but not much pressure.
3. g5e6 — Knight to e6, check! This is a forcing move.
4. g5e4 — Knight to e4, attacks f2, c3, d6, but e4 is protected by Black's pawn.
5. g5h3 — Knight to h3, not active.
6. g5f3 — Knight to f3, attacks e5, d4, h4, but not much pressure.
7. h1g1 — Rook to g1, possibly preparing to attack g6.
8. h1f1 — Rook to f1, attacks f2, but not much pressure.
9. e1f2 — King to f2, not urgent.
10. e1d2 — King to d2, not urgent.
11. h2h3 — Pawn move, not urgent.
12. c2c3 — Pawn move, attacks the a4 pawn, but Black can respond.
13. a2a3 — Pawn move, not urgent.
14. h2h4 — Pawn move, not urgent.
15. c2c4 — Pawn move, attacks the d5 square, but not urgent.

**Most forcing move:**  
g5e6 — Knight to e6, check! This forces the Black king to move. Let's analyze the consequences:

- If Kc5-d5: White can play Nf4+, forking king and e2 square.
- If Kc5-b4: White can play Nc7, attacking the a8 knight and a6 fork.
- If Kc5-b6: White can play Nc7, attacking the a8 knight.

But let's check if there are any tactics after Ne6+.

**Calculation after 1. Ng5-e6+**
- 1... Kc5-d5
    - 2. Nf4+ (forks king and e2, but not much gain)
- 1... Kc5-b4
    - 2. Nc7 (attacks a8 knight)
- 1... Kc5-b6
    - 2. Nc7 (attacks a8 knight)

Alternatively, after Ne6+, the king is forced to move, and White can activate the rook or push c2-c3 to attack the a4 pawn.

**Other candidate: h1g1**
- Prepares to attack g6, but not urgent.

**Other candidate: c2c3**
- Attacks a4, but Black can play a3.

**Conclusion:**  
The most forcing move is Ne6+, which forces the Black king to move and gives White the initiative. This is the best way to press for advantage and keep Black on the defensive.

**Final move:**
```
g5e6

2025-06-22 00:45:03,678 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.80s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** n7/8/4N1p1/3k4/p3p3/8/P1P4P/4Kb1R w K - 2 55

**White:** King e1, Knight e6, Rook h1, pawns a2, c2, h2  
**Black:** King d5, Bishop f1, pawns a4, e4, g6, knight a8

**Material:**  
White: Rook, Knight, 3 pawns  
Black: Bishop, Knight, 3 pawns

**Key points:**
- White's knight on e6 is very powerful, controlling many squares.
- Black's king is somewhat centralized but has limited mobility due to White's knight.
- Black's bishop on f1 is not active.
- Black's knight on a8 is out of play.
- White's rook on h1 can become active.
- White's king is safe for now.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6f8**: Knight attacks bishop, but bishop can move.
2. **e6d8**: Knight attacks bishop and knight, but knight is not on d8.
3. **e6g7**: Knight attacks bishop, but not as forcing.
4. **e6c7**: Knight attacks king, but not a check.
5. **e6g5**: Knight attacks e4 pawn and covers more squares.
6. **e6c5**: Knight attacks king, but not a check.
7. **e6f4**: Knight attacks e2 and g6.
8. **e6d4**: Knight attacks king, but not a check.
9. **h1g1**: Rook to open file, but not urgent.
10. **h1f1**: Rook to f-file, attacks bishop.
11. **e1f2**: King move, not urgent.
12. **e1d2**: King move, not urgent.
13. **e1f1**: King move, not urgent.
14. **e1d1**: King move, not urgent.
15. **h2h3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
16. **c2c3**: Pawn move, attacks king, but not a check.
17. **a2a3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
18. **h2h4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
19. **c2c4**: Pawn move, not urgent.

**Critical analysis:**
- The bishop on f1 is a threat if it becomes active, but currently, it is blocked.
- The knight on e6 can attack the bishop with tempo (e6f8).
- The rook can swing to f1 and attack the bishop directly (h1f1).
- The pawn on e4 is a passed pawn but is blockaded for now.

**Best move consideration:**
- **h1f1** attacks the bishop on f1, which is currently unprotected. If the bishop moves, White can play Nf4, attacking e2 and g6, or even c2c4, opening the center.
- **e6f8** attacks the bishop, but after Bc4, the bishop escapes and remains active.
- **h1f1** is more forcing, as the bishop has to move, and White can then activate the rook.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play **h1f1**, attacking the bishop and activating the rook.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King e1, Rook f1, Knight e6, Pawns a2, c2, h2
- Black: King c6, Knight a8, Pawns a4, e5, g6

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Knight, 3 pawns
- Black: Knight, 3 pawns

**Key factors:**
- White is up a rook for a knight (significant material advantage).
- Black's knight is stuck on a8, very passive.
- Black's king is centralized but cannot easily support pawn promotion.
- White's knight on e6 is very strong, controlling key squares.
- White's rook is on f1, ready to become active.
- White's king is safe and can become active soon.

**Immediate tactics:**
- No immediate mate, but White can activate the rook or push pawns.
- The knight on e6 covers key squares (f8, g7, d8, c5, etc.).
- Black's only real hope is to push the a-pawn or try to activate the king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f1f8**: Rook to the 8th rank, attacking the knight on a8 and threatening to invade.
2. **e6f8**: Knight to f8, but this doesn't seem to threaten anything.
3. **e6g5**: Knight to g5, but not threatening anything immediate.
4. **c2c4**: Pawn push, but not urgent.
5. **e1e2**: King activation, but not urgent.
6. **f1f7**: Rook to 7th rank, but f8 is more active.

**Best move:**
- **f1f8** is the most active, attacking the knight on a8, threatening to win more material, and invading the 8th rank. Black cannot defend the knight, and after Rxa8, White will be up a full rook, making the win trivial.

**Final move:**
```
f1f8
```

2025-06-22 00:45:46,699 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.96s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on e1, Rook on f8, Knight on e6, pawns on a2, c2, h2
- Black: King on b6, Knight on a8, pawns on a4, e5, g6

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Knight, 3 pawns
- Black: Knight, 3 pawns

**Key features:**
- White is up a rook for a knight, a decisive material advantage.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on b6.
- Black's knight is on a8, very passive.
- Black has a pawn on a4, which could be a passed pawn, but it's not dangerous yet.
- White's knight is very strong on e6, controlling key squares.
- White's rook on f8 is very active.

**Immediate threats:**
- No immediate mate threats for Black.
- White can consider activating the rook, attacking pawns, or centralizing the king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f8b8+**: Check, forcing the king to a7 or c6. If Kc6, then Nd4+ wins the a4 pawn.
2. **f8a8**: Attacks the knight, but the knight is not going anywhere.
3. **e6d8**: Knight attacks the a8 knight, but not urgent.
4. **c2c4**: Undermines Black's a4 pawn.
5. **h2h4**: Starts pushing kingside pawns.
6. **e1e2**: Centralizes the king.

**Calculating f8b8+:**
- 1. Rb8+ Ka7 (if Kc6, then Nd4+ Kd5 Nb5, White wins a pawn)
- After Ka7, White can play Nc7, attacking both the rook and the a8 knight.

But let's check if there's a more forcing win:

**1. Rb8+ Kc6**
- 2. Nd4+ Kd5 (if Kc7, then Rxa8)
- 3. Nb5 (attacking a4)
- Black cannot defend a4, so White will win another pawn.

**1. Rb8+ Ka7**
- 2. Nc7 Nxc7 (forced)
- 3. Rxa8+ Nxa8
- White is up a rook for a knight, and can now play c4, undermining a4.

**Conclusion:**
- **f8b8+** is the most forcing move, wins material, and keeps Black's king cut off.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f8b8
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b8), Knight (e6), King (e1), pawns on a2, c2, h2
- Black: King (a6), Knight (a8), pawns on a4, e5, g6

**Key features:**
- Black's king is on a6, somewhat boxed in.
- Black's knight is on a8, currently not active.
- White's rook is on b8, controlling the b-file and 8th rank.
- White's knight is on e6, very active and central.
- White's king is safe.
- White has a passed pawn on c2 and a2.
- Black's a4 pawn is advanced, but not immediately dangerous.
- Black's e5 pawn is advanced, but White's knight controls key squares.

**Immediate tactics:**
- The Black king is on a6, and the knight on a8 blocks its escape.
- The rook on b8 can swing to the 8th rank for checks.
- The knight on e6 can jump to c7 with check, forking king and knight.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6c7+**: Knight check, forking king and knight.
   - If K moves, Nxa8 wins the knight.
   - If K moves to a7, then Nxa8 wins the knight.
   - After Nxa8, White will be up a full rook and knight for a pawn.

2. **b8a8**: Rook takes knight, but not possible since knight is protected by king.

3. **b8b7**: Rook move, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.

4. **Other pawn moves**: Not urgent.

**Calculation for e6c7+:**
- 1. Nc7+ Ka7 (only move)
- 2. Nxa8 Kxa8
- Now, White is up a rook for two pawns, with a winning endgame.

**Is there anything better?**
- No forced mate, but winning the knight is decisive.

**Final move:**
```
e6c7

2025-06-22 00:46:15,857 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.39s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** nR6/k1N5/6p1/8/p3p3/8/P1P4P/4K3 w - - 7 59

**White:** King e1, Rook b8, Knight c7, Pawns a2, c2, h2  
**Black:** King a7, Knight a8, Pawns a4, e5, g6

**Material:** White is up a rook and knight for a knight and two pawns.  
**Threats:** Black's king is boxed in on a7, with the knight on a8 blocking escape. White's rook on b8 and knight on c7 are very active.  
**Immediate tactics:**  
- Rook b8 can move along the 8th rank, but Black's king is on a7 and knight on a8.  
- Knight c7 can jump to a8 for a check, but after Kxb8, White loses the rook.
- White can try to bring the king closer, but that's slow.
- Advancing pawns is possible, but not urgent.

**Critical idea:**  
- The Black king is nearly mated. If the White rook can get to a8, it would be mate, but the knight is in the way.
- If the knight moves, can the rook checkmate? Let's check:  
  - Nc7-a8+ Kxb8 (forced), then White has lost the rook for a knight, not ideal.
  - Rook can try to invade along the 8th rank, but nothing immediate.

**Best plan:**  
- White can play Rb8-b4, attacking the e4 pawn and preparing to invade on the 4th rank.
- Alternatively, White can play c2-c4, opening lines and preparing to push the c-pawn.

But let's check if there is a forced win:

- Rb8-a8 is not possible (knight on a8).
- Nc7-a8+ Kxb8, White loses the rook.
- Rb8-b4, attacking e4, but Black can defend with ...Nb6.
- c2-c4, trying to open the c-file, but Black has no immediate threats.

**Is there a way to trap the Black king?**
- If the knight moves, the rook can go to a8, but the knight is on a8.
- If White plays c7-e6, threatening Nc7-c5+ or Nc7-g5, but nothing immediate.

**What about c2-c4?**
- If Black plays a3, White can play Ra4+ and win the a-pawn.

**What about advancing the h-pawn?**
- h2-h4, but not urgent.

**Is there a zugzwang?**
- If White passes, Black has no useful moves.

**Conclusion:**  
White is completely winning, but there is no immediate mate. The best move is to improve the position and keep Black tied up. The move c2-c4 is strong, as it prepares to open the c-file and possibly invade with the rook.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c2c4
```

2025-06-22 00:46:27,824 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.86s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** nR6/k1N5/8/6p1/p1P1p3/8/P6P/4K3 w - - 0 60

- White: King on e1, Rook on b8, Knight on c7, pawns on a2, c4, h2
- Black: King on a7, Knight on a8, pawns on a4, e4, g5

**Material:**
- White: Rook, Knight, 3 pawns
- Black: Knight, 3 pawns

**Position:**
- Black's king is on a7, boxed in by its own knight on a8 and pawn on a4.
- White's rook on b8 is dominating the b-file, and the knight on c7 is very active.
- Black's knight on a8 is completely trapped.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Immediate threats:**
- White can checkmate with Rook to a8 if the knight is removed.
- White can also try to invade with the rook or knight.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c7xa8**: Knight captures the knight on a8, threatening Ra8# next move (since the Black king will be on a7, a8 is covered by the rook).
2. **b8a8**: Rook captures the knight, but then the rook is not on the b-file anymore.
3. **c4c5**: Advance the pawn, but doesn't create an immediate threat.
4. **b8b7+**: Rook check, but the king can go to a6.
5. **Other rook moves**: Don't seem to create immediate threats.

**Analysis of c7xa8:**
- After c7xa8, Black has no way to prevent Ra8# next move, as the king cannot escape to a6 (blocked by its own pawn on a4).
- Black's only possible moves are with pawns (e.g., e3, g4), but none can prevent mate.

**Conclusion:**
- **c7xa8** is a forced win: White will checkmate with Ra8# next move.

**Final move:**
```
c7a8
```

**FEN:** NR6/8/k7/6p1/p1P1p3/8/P6P/4K3 w - - 1 61

**White:** King e1, Rook b8, Knight a8, Pawns a2, c4, h2  
**Black:** King a6, Rook a8, Pawns a4, e4, g5

**Material:**  
White: Rook, Knight, 3 pawns  
Black: Rook, 3 pawns

**Positional factors:**  
- White's rook is very active on b8, Black's rook is stuck on a8.  
- White's knight is on a8, not very active but can be repositioned.  
- Black's king is on a6, White's king is on e1 (far from the action).  
- White has a passed pawn on c4, Black has a passed pawn on a4 and e4.  
- Black's g5 pawn is advanced, but not immediately dangerous.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c4c5**: Advance the passed pawn, restrict Black's king and rook, and prepare to support with rook or knight.
2. **h2h3 / h2h4**: Not urgent, doesn't impact the position.
3. **a2a3**: Stops Black's a-pawn from advancing, but not urgent since a3 is not threatened.
4. **Rook moves (b8h8, etc.)**: Lateral rook moves could threaten Black's pawns or support c-pawn.
5. **Knight moves (a8c7, a8b6)**: Knight can reposition to a better square, but c7/b6 are not immediately impactful.
6. **King moves**: e1f2, e1e2, etc. King is far from the action, not urgent.

**Critical analysis:**
- Advancing the c-pawn (c4c5) is very strong. It restricts Black's king and rook, and threatens to create a passed pawn. If Black tries to push a3, White can respond with a2a3, keeping the queenside closed.
- Rook moves along the 8th rank (b8h8, etc.) don't create immediate threats.
- Knight moves don't create immediate threats.
- King moves are too slow.

**Best move:**  
**c4c5** is the most pressing, as it advances the passed pawn, restricts Black's king and rook, and keeps the initiative.

Final move:
```
c4c5
```

2025-06-22 00:46:44,922 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.73s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** NR6/8/k7/2P3p1/4p3/p7/P6P/4K3 w - - 0 62

**Material count:**
- White: Rook (b8), Knight (a8), King (e1), pawns (a2, c5, h2)
- Black: King (a6), pawns (a3, e4, g5)

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's a3 pawn is close to queening.
- White's c5 pawn is also advanced.
- White's rook is on b8, knight on a8, king on e1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b8b1**: Rook to b1, attacking the a3 pawn from behind.
2. **c5c6**: Advance the c-pawn, but Black's a-pawn is closer to queening.
3. **a8c7**: Move knight, but doesn't immediately help.
4. **h2h3/h2h4**: Not urgent.
5. **e1d2/e1e2**: King moves, but not urgent.
6. **b8a8**: Not legal.
7. **b8b7**: Rook to b7, but doesn't help.
8. **b8b2**: Rook to b2, block a-pawn.

**Critical issue:** Black's a3 pawn is two squares from queening. If we don't stop it, Black will promote.

**Best defense:** Rook to b3 or b2 to block the pawn. b3 is not possible (pawn on a3), so b2 is the only way.

**Check if b8b2 is safe:** After b8b2, if Black plays axb2, we can recapture with the rook. If Black pushes a2, we can play Rxa2.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play **b8b2**, blockading the a-pawn and preparing to capture it.

```
b8b2

2025-06-22 00:47:02,674 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.19s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Knight (a8), Rook (b2), Pawn (c5, h2)
- Black: King (a5), Pawn (a3, e4, g5)

**Position:**
- White's knight on a8 is awkward but can jump to c7 or b6.
- White's rook on b2 is very active and can swing to many files/ranks.
- White's pawn on c5 is passed and can advance.
- Black's king is on a5, somewhat cut off.
- Black's pawns: a3 is advanced, e4 is passed, g5 is advanced.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's a3 pawn is close to queening, but White can stop it with the rook.
- White's c5 pawn can advance, but Black's king is nearby.
- Black's e4 pawn is also dangerous, but White's rook can help stop it.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b2b3**: Immediately attacks the a3 pawn, but Black can play a2, and after Rxa2+ Kb4, the king is active.
2. **b2b4**: Checks the king, but after Kxb4, the a3 pawn is still dangerous.
3. **c5c6**: Pushes the passed pawn, but Black can play Kb6 and attack the pawn.
4. **a8c7**: Moves the knight to a more central square, but doesn't address the a3 pawn.
5. **h2h3/h2h4**: Not urgent.
6. **b2b5+**: Checks the king, but after Kxa4, the a3 pawn is unstoppable.
7. **b2b8**: Rook behind the passed pawn, but doesn't threaten anything immediately.

**Critical analysis:**
- The a3 pawn is the most urgent threat. If Black plays a2, White must be able to stop it.
- If White plays b2b3, Black plays a2, and after Rxa2+ Kb4, the king is very active.
- If White plays b2b4+, Black plays Kxb4, and the a3 pawn is still there.
- If White plays b2b5+, Black plays Kxa4, and the a3 pawn is unstoppable.
- If White plays b2b6, attacking the a6 square, but doesn't stop the a3 pawn.

**Best move:**
- **b2b3** is the most logical, attacking the a3 pawn directly. If Black pushes a2, White can play Rxa2+ and then try to use the rook and knight to stop the pawns. The rook on b3 can also swing to the kingside if needed.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b2b3
```

2025-06-22 00:47:11,889 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.55s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Knight (a8), Rook (b3), Pawn (c5, a2, h2), King (e1)
- Black: King (a6), Pawn (a3, e4, g5)

**Position:**
- White's knight on a8 is awkward but can jump to c7 or b6.
- White's rook on b3 is active and can swing along the third rank.
- White's c5 pawn is advanced and can go to c6.
- Black's king is on a6, somewhat boxed in by its own pawn on a3.
- Black's a3 pawn is dangerous, but not immediately queening.
- Black's e4 and g5 pawns are advanced but not immediately threatening.
- White's king is on e1, not very active.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's a3 pawn is two squares from queening, but White can attack it with the rook.
- White's c5 pawn can advance, but c6 doesn't seem to threaten anything immediately.
- The rook can swing to the third rank to attack pawns or cut off the king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. b3xa3: Rook captures the a3 pawn, removing Black's most dangerous passed pawn.
2. b3b8: Rook to b8, possibly to support c8=Q or to cut off the king.
3. c5c6: Advance the c-pawn, but Black's king can approach.
4. a8c7 or a8b6: Move the knight, but doesn't seem urgent.
5. h2h3 or h2h4: Advance the h-pawn, but not urgent.
6. King moves: Not urgent.

**Analysis:**
- Taking the a3 pawn with the rook seems the most urgent and best move. It removes Black's most dangerous asset and leaves White with a clear material advantage (Rook + Knight vs. King + pawns). After b3xa3, White can push the c-pawn, use the rook to support queening, and the knight can join the action.

**Check for tactics:**
- Is there any danger to the rook after b3xa3? No, Black has no immediate threats.
- Is there any better move? Advancing c5c6 is not as urgent as capturing the a3 pawn.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the a3 pawn with the rook.

2025-06-22 00:47:20,857 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.71s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Knight on a8, Rook on a3, King on e1, Pawn on c5, Pawn on a2, Pawn on h2
- Black: King on b5, Pawn on e4, Pawn on g5

**Position:**
- White's knight on a8 is not active but can be repositioned.
- White's rook on a3 is well placed to swing along the third rank.
- White's king is safe on e1.
- White's c5 pawn is advanced and could become a passed pawn.
- Black's king is on b5, close to the c5 pawn.
- Black's pawns on e4 and g5 are advanced but not immediately threatening.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a8c7** (activates the knight, attacks e6 and b5)
2. **a8b6** (attacks the king, but the knight could be trapped)
3. **a3a7** (rook to the 7th rank, attacks the king and supports c7 knight jump)
4. **a3a6** (rook attacks the king, but b5 is covered)
5. **c5c6** (pushes the pawn, but Black can take with Kxc6)
6. **h2h3/h2h4** (pawn moves, slow and not urgent)
7. **King moves** (not urgent)

**Deeper analysis:**
- **a8c7**: Knight attacks b5 and e6. If Black plays Kxc5, then Rc3+ wins the king forking the king and knight.
- **a3a7**: Rook attacks the king, but Black can play Kc6, and the rook is not doing much.
- **c5c6**: Black can simply take with Kxc6, and White loses the pawn.
- **a3a6**: Rook attacks the king, but the king can move to c4 or c6.

**Best move:**
- **a8c7** is the most active, bringing the knight into play and threatening to fork or support the c5 pawn. It also covers e6, which could be important if Black tries to push e3.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
a8c7
```

2025-06-22 00:47:29,763 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.90s):
Let's analyze the position:

White: King on e1, rook on a3, knight on c7, pawn on a2, c5, h2  
Black: King on c6, pawn on e4, g5

Material: White is up a rook and a knight for two pawns. Black's king is somewhat centralized, but White's pieces are very active. White's c5 pawn is advanced and could become a passed pawn. The knight on c7 is very powerful, controlling key squares and supporting pawn promotion ideas.

Short-term tactics:
- The knight can check the king with c7-e6+ or c7-d5+.
- The rook can swing along the third rank or go to the a-file.
- The c5 pawn is ready to advance, but c5-c6 is not possible right now due to the king.
- Black's pawns are not immediately threatening.

Long-term strategy:
- White should try to activate the rook and knight, push the c-pawn, and avoid any counterplay from Black's pawns.
- The knight can be used to check the king and force it away from the c-pawn.
- The rook can cut off the king or support pawn promotion.

Candidate moves:
1. c7-e6+ (knight check): Forces the king to b5 or d7. If Kd7, then c5-c6+ wins the e4 pawn and pushes the c-pawn.
2. c7-d5+ (knight check): King can go to d7 or b5. Similar ideas.
3. a3-a6 (rook check): King can go to d7 or b5. But this doesn't seem to progress much.
4. a3-a8 (rook to a-file): Prepares to support c-pawn push, but not forcing.
5. h2-h3 or h2-h4: Not urgent.

Let's calculate 1. c7-e6+:
- 66. Ne6 Kd7 (if Kb5, then c5-c6 wins)
  - 67. c6+ Kxe6 (if Kxc6, then a6 wins)
  - But after Kd7, c6+ is strong.

If 66. Ne6+ Kb5, then 67. c6 Kxc6 68. a6 and the pawn queens.

If 66. Ne6+ Kd7, then 67. c6+ Kxe6 68. a6 and again, the pawn queens.

Therefore, 66. Ne6+ is a forcing move that will win material or promote a pawn.

Final move:
```
c7e6

2025-06-22 00:47:39,454 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.96s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Knight (e6), Rook (a3), Pawn (a2, c5, h2)
- Black: King (c6), Pawn (e3, g5)

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's e3-pawn is close to queening, but White's rook on a3 can swing to e3 in one move.
- Black's king is somewhat centralized but cannot support the e3 pawn directly.
- White's knight on e6 is very powerful, controlling key squares (d8, f8, g7, g5, f4, d4, c7).
- White's rook is flexible on the third rank.
- White's c5 pawn is advanced and could become a threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6d4+**: Knight check, but Black king can go to d5 or c7.
2. **a3e3**: Rook takes the e3 pawn, eliminating Black's most dangerous threat.
3. **a3a6**: Rook check, but Black king can go to d5 or b7.
4. **h2h3/h2h4**: Not urgent, as Black's g5 pawn is not immediately threatening.
5. **e6g5**: Knight takes pawn, but then e2+ is possible for Black.
6. **e6f8**: Knight retreat, not useful.
7. **e6g7**: Knight to g7, not useful.

**Critical analysis:**
- The e3 pawn is the biggest threat. If we don't capture it, Black will play e2+ and try to queen.
- After **a3e3**, if Black plays Kd5, White can play Nc7+ and win the a7 pawn, or c5-c6 to promote.
- If we play **a3e3** and Black plays Kd5, we can play Nc7+ Kxc5 Rxe3, and White is completely winning.

**Tactics:**
- After **a3e3**, Black has no immediate threats. The g5 pawn is not dangerous.
- White's c5 pawn is ready to advance.
- White's knight and rook coordinate well.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to immediately capture the dangerous e3 pawn with the rook.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Rook (e3), Knight (e6), Pawn (a2, c5, h2)
- Black: King (b7), Pawn (g5)

**Position:**
- White's knight on e6 is very strong, controlling key squares.
- White's rook is on e3, ready to swing.
- White's king is safe on e1.
- White has a passed pawn on c5, which is two steps from promotion.
- Black's king is on b7, close to the c5 pawn but cannot stop it alone.
- Black's only pawn is on g5, far from queening.

**Immediate threats:**
- White can push c5-c6, threatening to promote.
- Black's king is cut off from the c-file by the rook and knight.
- Black's pawn on g5 is not dangerous yet.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c5c6: Push the passed pawn. If ...Kxc6, then Nd4+ wins the king and rook endgame easily.
2. e6f8: Knight move, but doesn't seem to threaten anything immediate.
3. e3e5: Rook move, but not necessary.
4. e3e4: Rook move, not urgent.
5. h2h3: Slow, not relevant.
6. e3e2: Defensive, not needed.

**Calculation:**
- c5c6 is the most forcing move. If Black plays Kxc6, then Nd4+ forks king and pawn, and White wins easily.
- If Black ignores the pawn, White will play c7 next and promote.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the passed pawn.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Rook (e3), Knight (e6), Pawn (c6, a2, h2)
- Black: King (b8), Pawn (g5)

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats and opportunities:**
- White's c6 pawn is one step from promotion.
- Black's king is cut off on the b-file.
- White's knight on e6 controls key squares (d8, f8, g7, c5, g5, c7, f4, d4).
- White's rook is on e3, ready to support the c-pawn or attack.
- Black's only pawn is on g5, not immediately threatening.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c6c7**: Advance the pawn, threatening to promote next move.
2. **e3e5**: Attack the g5 pawn, but not urgent.
3. **e3b3+**: Check, but Black's king just moves to a8.
4. **e6f8+**: Check, but king just goes to a7.
5. **e3e4**: Not urgent.
6. **e3c3**: Prepare to support c-pawn.

**Analysis:**
- **c6c7**: If Black plays Kc8, then c7c8=Q is unstoppable, as the rook and knight cover the promotion square. If Black tries to bring the king closer, it's too late.
- **e3e5**: Not urgent, as Black's g-pawn is not dangerous.
- **e3b3+**: King goes to a8, and then c6c7 is still possible, but not as direct.

**Best move:**
- Advancing the c-pawn is the most direct and decisive. Black cannot stop promotion.

Final move:

2025-06-22 00:48:02,773 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.17s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/2P5/4N3/6p1/8/4R3/P6P/4K3 w - - 1 70

**White:** King e1, Rook e3, Knight e6, Pawn c7, a2, h2  
**Black:** King c8, Pawn g5

**Material:** White is up a full rook and knight, and has a dangerous passed pawn on c7.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White threatens to promote c7-c8=Q next move.
- Black's king is on c8, so c7-c8=Q is not possible right now.
- Black has no immediate threats; the pawn on g5 is not dangerous.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6f8+** (Knight check): King must move to b7 or d8.
2. **e6d8+** (Knight check): King must move to d7 or c7.
3. **e3e8** (Rook to e8): Threatens mate and supports c8=Q.
4. **e3e5** (Rook to e5): Attacks g5 pawn.
5. **e3e4** (Rook to e4): Similar idea.
6. **e3g3** (Rook to g3): Attacks g5 pawn.

**Critical lines:**

- **e6f8+**: If Kc7, then c7c8=Q+ wins immediately. If Kd8, then c7c8=Q+ also wins.
- **e6d8+**: If Kd7, then c7c8=Q+ wins. If Kc7, c7c8=Q+ wins.
- **e3e8**: Threatens mate, but doesn't force anything immediately.

**Calculation:**

Let's check **e6f8+**:
- 1. Ne6-f8+ Kc7 (only move)
- 2. c7-c8=Q+ Kd6 (forced)
- 3. Qc8-c5# (checkmate)

Alternatively, after 1. Ne6-f8+ Kd8:
- 2. c7-c8=Q+ Ke7 (forced)
- 3. Qc8-c5# (checkmate)

So **e6f8+** is a forced win in both cases.

**Final move:**
```
e6f8
```

2025-06-22 00:48:10,015 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.91s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King e1, Rook e3, Knight f8, Pawn c7, a2, h2
- Black: King c8, Pawn g4

**Material:**
- White: Rook + Knight + 3 pawns
- Black: King + 1 pawn

**Threats and Opportunities:**
- White's c7 pawn is one step from promotion.
- Black's king is stuck on c8.
- White's knight on f8 dominates key squares (e6, g6, d7, h7).
- White's rook is very flexible on e3.
- Black's only pawn (g4) is far from queening and not dangerous.

**Immediate Candidate Moves:**
1. c7-c8=Q (but pawn is on c7, not c8, so not possible yet)
2. Rook moves: e3-e8+, e3-e7, e3-e6, etc.
3. Knight moves: f8-h7, f8-d7, f8-g6, f8-e6
4. King moves: e1-f2, e1-e2, etc.
5. Pawn moves: h2-h3, a2-a3, h2-h4, a2-a4

**Key Plan:**
- Promote the c7 pawn. But Black's king is on c8, so we need to drive it away.
- The rook can check on e8 or e7, but the king can't move.
- The knight can move to d7 or e6 to support c7-c8=Q.

**Check for Forcing Moves:**
- Rook checks: e3-e8+ or e3-e7+ are not possible since the king is on c8 and both squares are not accessible.
- Knight moves: f8-d7 attacks the king and supports c8, but the king can't move.
- Rook e3-e8: Not possible, as e8 is not attacked.

**Best Plan:**
- Move the knight to d7, which supports c8 and threatens c7-c8=Q.
- After Nf8-d7, Black has no way to stop c7-c8=Q.

**Check for Counterplay:**
- Black can try g4-g3, but it's too slow.

**Final Move:**
The best move is:
```
f8d7
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Rook (e3), Pawn (a2, h2), Pawn (d7), Pawn (c7)
- Black: King (c8), Pawn (g3)

**White to move.**

**Threats and ideas:**
- White is up a rook and two pawns for a pawn.
- The c7 pawn is one step from promotion, supported by the d7 pawn.
- Black's king is cut off on the 8th rank.
- Black's only counterplay is the g3 pawn, but it's too slow.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c7-c8=Q** is not legal (no pawn on c7).
2. **d7-f8** (promote pawn): Not a legal pawn move.
3. **e3-e8**: Rook to e8, threatening to promote c7 next.
4. **e3-e7**: Rook to e7, supporting c7.
5. **e3-e4**: Rook to e4, but doesn't help.
6. **e3-g3**: Rook takes pawn on g3, but allows Black's king to escape.
7. **e3-e6**: Rook to e6, but not as direct.
8. **e3-e5**: Rook to e5, not as direct.
9. **c7-c8=Q**: Not legal, pawn is on d7.

**Best plan:**
- The c7 pawn is not on the board, but d7 is. So, d7-d8=Q is not legal, as d7 is not a pawn.
- The rook can go to e8, cutting off the king and preparing to promote the d7 pawn.

**Check for immediate mate:**
- e3-e8, then d7-e8=Q is unstoppable.

**Check for Black's counterplay:**
- Black has no checks or threats.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to play the rook to e8, preparing to promote the d7 pawn next move.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King e1, Rook e8, Knight d7, Pawn c7, Pawn a2, Pawn h2
- Black: King b7, Pawn g3

**Material:**
- White is up a rook and knight for a pawn.

**Threats:**
- White's c7 pawn is one step from promotion.
- Black's g3 pawn is not an immediate threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c7-c8=Q: Promote the pawn to a queen. Black's king is on b7, so after promotion, White will have overwhelming material.
2. c7-c8=R/B/N: Less effective than a queen.
3. Rook moves: Not urgent, as promotion is available.
4. Knight moves: Not urgent.
5. King moves: Not urgent.
6. Pawn moves: Not urgent.

**Tactics:**
- After c7-c8=Q, Black cannot stop White from winning. There are no stalemate tricks, as Black's king has squares to move to (a8, b8, c8, a7, c7).

**Check for stalemate:**
- After c7-c8=Q, Black's king on b7 has a7, b8, c8, a8, c7 available. No stalemate.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

Final move:
```
c7c8q

2025-06-22 00:48:30,965 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (c8), Rook (e8), Knight (d7), King (e1), pawns (a2, h2)
- Black: King (a7), pawn (g3)

**King safety:**
- Black's king is on a7, very exposed.
- White's king is safe on e1.

**Threats:**
- White threatens mate with Qb8# or Ra8#.
- Black has no immediate threats; the pawn on g3 is far from queening.

**Candidate moves:**
- Qb8# is not possible (queen is on c8, b8 is empty, but the king is on a7).
- Ra8# is not possible (rook is on e8, a8 is empty, but the king is on a7).
- Qc7+ is possible, forcing the king to a6.
- Qb7+ is possible, forcing the king to a6.
- Qc5+ is possible, but the king can escape to a6.
- Qb8+ is not possible (queen is on c8, b8 is empty).
- Qc6 is possible, but not a check.

But let's look for a forced mate.

**Check all checks:**
1. Qc7+ (forces Ka6)
2. Qb7+ (forces Ka6)
3. Ra8+ (forces Kb6)
4. Qc5+ (forces Ka6)
5. Qb8+ (not possible)
6. Qc6 (not a check)
7. Qc1 (not a check)

Let's try Qc7+:

1. Qc7+ Ka6 (only move)
2. Ra8+ Kb5 (only move)
3. Qb7+ Kc4 (only move)
4. Qb3+ Kd4 (only move)
5. Qb4+ Ke3 (only move)
6. Qd2+ Kf3 (only move)
7. Qe2# (checkmate)

But let's check the first move: Qc7+.

Is there a faster mate? Let's check Ra8+:

1. Ra8+ Kb6 (only move)
2. Qb8+ Kc5 (only move)
3. Qb5+ Kd4 (only move)
4. Qb4+ Ke3 (only move)
5. Qd2+ Kf3 (only move)
6. Qe2# (checkmate)

So both Qc7+ and Ra8+ lead to forced mate in a few moves.

But let's check if there is a mate in one.

No mate in one.

So, let's play the move that starts the forced mate sequence:

```
c8c7

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King e1, Rook e8, Queen c7, Knight d7, Pawns a2, h2
- Black: King a6, Pawn g3

**Material:**
- White is up a queen, rook, and knight for a lone pawn. Black has no pieces except the king and a passed pawn on g3.

**Threats:**
- Black's only hope is to promote the g3 pawn, but it's not immediate.
- White can checkmate quickly with coordinated pieces.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qb6#** (c7b6): Queen to b6 is checkmate, as the Black king on a6 has no escape squares.
2. Other checks: Qc6+, Qc8+, but they don't deliver mate.
3. Rook moves: Re6+, but the king can go to a5.
4. Knight moves: Nf8, but not necessary.

**Verification:**
- After Qb6#, the Black king on a6 is boxed in by its own pawn and White's pieces:
    - a7, b7, b6, a5, b5 are all covered or occupied.

**Conclusion:** Qb6# is checkmate.

Final move:
```
