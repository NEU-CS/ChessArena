2025-06-22 11:57:10,695 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 3.30s):
Let's analyze the position:

White has played 1.Nh3, an uncommon move, developing the knight to the rim. Black has a full range of standard opening options. The best approach is to claim the center and develop pieces harmoniously.

Candidate moves:
1. e7e5 – Occupies the center, opens lines for the bishop and queen.
2. d7d5 – Also claims the center, but slightly less flexible than e5.
3. g8f6 – Develops a knight to its best square, attacks e4.
4. b8c6 – Develops the queenside knight, but less urgent than kingside development.
5. g7g6 – Prepares Bg7, but White has no immediate threats on the long diagonal.

Of these, 1...e5 is the most principled, taking the center and opening lines for development.

Final move:
```
e7e5
```

2025-06-22 11:58:04,311 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.10s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1. Nh3 e5 2. Ng5**

White's knight is on g5, attacking the e4 and f7 squares. The f7 pawn is a common target in the opening, especially with a knight on g5. However, White has not developed any other pieces yet, so there is no immediate threat of Nxf7 (since the queen is not on h5 or f3).

**Black's options:**

- Develop a knight: g8f6, g8e7, g8h6
- Develop a bishop: f8e7, f8d6, f8c5, f8b4, f8a3
- Develop a queen: d8e7, d8f6, d8g5
- Pawn moves: d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, e5e4, h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, h7h5, f7f5, d7d5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5

**Critical threats:**
- No immediate threat of Nxf7, but White may play d4 and then Bc4, increasing pressure on f7.
- Black should develop and defend f7 if possible.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8f6**: Develops a knight, attacks e4, and covers h7. If White plays d4, Black can respond with exd4.
2. **h7h6**: Directly attacks the knight on g5, forcing it to decide (retreat or exchange).
3. **f8c5**: Develops a bishop, attacks f2, and prepares to castle.
4. **d7d6**: Solidifies the center, prepares to develop the bishop.
5. **g8e7**: Develops a knight, covers f7, but blocks the bishop.
6. **g8h6**: Develops a knight, attacks the g5 knight, but places the knight on the rim.

**Deeper analysis:**
- **h7h6**: If White plays Nf3 or Nh3, Black has gained a tempo. If White plays Nxf7, after Kxf7, White has no follow-up and is down a piece for a pawn.
- **g8f6**: If White plays d4, Black can play exd4, and after Qxd4, Nc6 gains tempo on the queen.
- **f8c5**: If White plays d4, Black can play exd4, and after Qh5, Black can play Qf6 or Nh6.

**Best move:**
- **h7h6** is a direct challenge to the knight and gains a tempo. There is no immediate threat to f7, and if White retreats, Black can continue development. If White plays Nxf7, Black is better after Kxf7.

**Final move:**
```
h7h6

2025-06-22 11:58:59,702 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.51s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 1. Nh3 e5 2. Ng5 h6 3. Na3**

- White's knights are on a3 and g5, both somewhat awkward but g5 is eyeing f7.
- Black's h6 pawn is attacked by the knight on g5, but can be defended or the knight can be chased away.
- Black's development is lagging a bit, but White's queenside is also undeveloped.
- The e5 pawn is strong, and Black has a lead in central space.
- The move h6g5 is possible, capturing the knight, but let's check if it's safe.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **h6xg5**: Captures the knight. Let's check for tactics:
   - If White plays d4, Black can play exd4.
   - If White plays e4, Black can play exd4.
   - No immediate recapture or tactic for White.
   - White could try d4, but Black is fine.
2. **b8c6**: Develops a piece, but leaves h6 hanging.
3. **g8f6**: Develops a knight, but again, h6 is hanging.
4. **d8g5**: Queen takes knight, but then White can play d4, gaining tempo.
5. **d8e7**: Queen defends h6, but not necessary if we can just take the knight.

**Tactical check:**
- After h6xg5, White cannot immediately punish Black. The knight on a3 is not threatening, and White's development is behind.
- Taking the knight gives Black a material advantage.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the knight on g5.

```

2025-06-22 12:00:28,636 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.20s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 4. e3:**
- White's knight is on a3, not very active.
- White's bishop on f1 is still undeveloped.
- White's kingside is a bit awkward, with the knight having moved out and back.
- Black has a pawn on g5, which is slightly overextended but not under attack.
- Black's development is normal, but the kingside is a bit exposed due to the advanced g5 pawn.
- Black to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b8c6**: Develops a knight, controls the center, and prepares to support e5.
2. **g8f6**: Develops a knight, attacks e4, and prepares to castle.
3. **f8g7**: Not possible, bishop is blocked.
4. **f8e7**: Develops bishop, prepares to castle.
5. **d7d5**: Strikes in the center, but White can play exd5.
6. **g7g6**: Prepares to fianchetto, but weakens the dark squares further.
7. **g5g4**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play d4 and attack the center.
8. **e5e4**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play d3 and attack the pawn.

**Best move:**
- **b8c6** is the most natural, developing a piece and controlling the center. It also prepares to support e5 and possibly play d5 in the future. It does not create weaknesses and keeps options open.

**Other considerations:**
- **g8f6** is also good, but after d4, White gets a strong center.
- **g5g4** is premature and weakens Black's kingside.
- **e5e4** gives White a tempo with d3.

**Final decision:** Develop the queenside knight to c6.

2025-06-22 12:01:55,165 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.13s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 4...Nc6 5. Nb5**

- White's knights are on b5 and g5.
- Black's pawn structure is intact, but White is threatening to jump to c7 with the knight, forking king and rook.
- The pawn on g5 is slightly exposed, but not under immediate threat.
- Black's e5 pawn is strong, and White's e3 move is passive.
- Black's development is slightly ahead, but White's knight on b5 is menacing.

**Key threats:**
- White threatens Nc7+, forking king and rook.
- Black needs to address this threat immediately.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...a6 (attacks the knight on b5, but after Nxc7+ Qxc7, White wins the exchange)
2. ...d5 (defends c7, but White can play Qf3 or d4)
3. ...Nf6 (develops, but doesn't address Nc7+)
4. ...a5 (prevents Nb4, but not Nc7+)
5. ...Bc5 (develops, but doesn't address Nc7+)
6. ...Rc8 (defends c7, but White can play d4)
7. ...d6 (defends c7, but White can play d4)

**Best move:**
- The most direct way to prevent Nc7+ is ...d6, defending the c7 square. This also opens the diagonal for the light-squared bishop and keeps the center solid.

**Double-checking ...d6:**
- 6. d4 (White tries to open the center)
- ...exd4 (Black captures)
- exd4 (White recaptures)
- ...a6 (now the knight must retreat)
- Nc3 (retreat)
- ...Bg7 (develop)
- Black is safe, no fork, and has a solid position.

**Alternative: ...a6**
- 6. Nxc7+ Qxc7 7. d4 (White has won the exchange and has a strong center)

**Conclusion:**
- ...d6 is the best move, defending c7 and keeping the position solid.

My move is:
```
d7d6

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2nN4/4p1p1/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6

**Move history:**  
1. e7e5  
2. h3g5  
3. h7h6  
4. b1a3  
5. h6g5  
6. e2e3  
7. b8c6  
8. a3b5  
9. d7d6  
10. b5d6  

**Current position:**  
White's knight is on d6, attacking the black queen on d8 and threatening to fork the king and rook with Nxf7. Black to move.

**Legal moves:**  
- e8e7 (king to e7)
- e8d7 (king to d7)
- f8d6 (bishop captures knight)
- d8d6 (queen captures knight)
- c7d6 (pawn captures knight)

**Analysis of candidate moves:**

1. **f8d6 (Bxd6):**  
   - Bishop captures the knight.  
   - After Bxd6, White can play d4, developing and opening the center.  
   - No immediate threats to Black, but White has a lead in development.

2. **d8d6 (Qxd6):**  
   - Queen captures the knight.  
   - White can play d4, gaining space and tempo.  
   - Queen is somewhat exposed in the center.

3. **c7d6 (cxd6):**  
   - Pawn captures the knight.  
   - This opens the c-file for the rook and keeps the queen and bishop on their original squares.
   - The pawn structure is solid, and Black has no immediate weaknesses.
   - White has no immediate threats, and Black can develop comfortably.

4. **e8e7 (Ke7) or e8d7 (Kd7):**  
   - Moving the king is unnecessary and loses castling rights.  
   - Not optimal.

**Best move:**

Between Bxd6, Qxd6, and cxd6, the most solid and positionally sound move is **cxd6**. It develops the pawn, opens the c-file, and keeps the queen and bishop flexible for future development. There are no immediate tactical threats, and Black maintains a solid structure.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c7d6
```

2025-06-22 12:04:25,348 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.94s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 7. d3:**
- White's pieces: Bishop on f1, Queen on d1, King on e1, Rooks on a1 and h1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d3, e3, f2, g2, h2.
- Black's pieces: Bishop on c8, Queen on d8, King on e8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Knights on c6, pawns on a7, b7, d6, e5, f7, g5.

**Key points:**
- Black has a space advantage in the center and kingside.
- White's queenside is undeveloped, and the king is still in the center.
- Black's g5 pawn is advanced, and the kingside is slightly weakened, but White has no immediate threats.
- Black's knight on c6 is well-placed, and the light-squared bishop is still undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6d5**: Grabs more space and opens the center. However, it could allow White to exchange pawns and open lines for development.
2. **g5g4**: Kicks the f3 knight if it were there, but currently, it just gives up the g4 square.
3. **f7f5**: Expands on the kingside, but weakens e6 and g6.
4. **c8e6**: Develops the bishop to an active square, eyes the a2-g8 diagonal.
5. **f8e7**: Prepares to castle.
6. **d8b6**: Queen out, attacks b2, but could be premature.
7. **c6b4**: Knight jump, but doesn't threaten much.
8. **g8f6**: Develops the knight, supports e4, prepares to castle.

**Best plan:**
- Develop pieces, keep the center strong, and prepare to castle.
- The move **f8e7** is solid, developing the bishop and preparing to castle kingside.
- **g8f6** is also very natural, developing the knight and controlling the center.
- **c8e6** is tempting, but it blocks the e7 square for the king or bishop.

**Between f8e7 and g8f6:**
- **g8f6** develops a piece and supports the center, but after Nf3, White can challenge the center.
- **f8e7** is more flexible, keeps the knight's options open, and prepares to castle.

**Final decision:**
I will play the most flexible and developing move, preparing to castle and keeping the center solid.

Let's analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White's king is still in the center, but can castle kingside.
- Black's king is also in the center and can castle kingside.
- White's bishop on e2 is developed, and the other bishop is on e3.
- Black has a strong pawn center and bishop pair.
- The center is relatively closed, but Black has more space and potential for kingside play.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **g8f6**: Develops the knight, attacks the e4 square, and prepares to castle kingside.
2. **c8e6**: Develops the bishop, attacks the a2 pawn, but White can defend easily.
3. **d8b6**: Queen move, but not very effective right now.
4. **g7g6**: Prepares to fianchetto the bishop, but not urgent.
5. **e8f8**: King move, not necessary.
6. **d6d5**: Opens the center, but White can play d4 and block.
7. **e5e4**: Gains space, attacks the bishop, but White can play d4.
8. **c6d4**: Knight jump, but White can exchange or ignore.

**Most Logical Move:**
- **g8f6** is the most natural. It develops a piece, controls the center, and prepares for castling. There are no immediate threats from White, and this move keeps the position solid.

**Tactical Check:**
- No immediate tactics for either side.
- No hanging pieces.

**Strategic Plan:**
- Develop the knight to f6.
- Prepare to castle kingside.
- Maintain central control.

**Final Move:**
```
g8f6

2025-06-22 12:06:33,027 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 10. Bf3:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on f3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d3, e3, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Bishop on e7, Knight on f6 and c6, pawns on a7, b7, d6, e5, g5, f7, h7.

**Key features:**
- Black has a strong center and space advantage.
- White's king is uncastled, but so is Black's.
- Black's g5 pawn is advanced, supporting kingside play.
- White's bishop on f3 is well-placed, eyeing c6 and b7, and supporting e4 in the future.
- Black's dark-squared bishop is on e7, ready to castle.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Castling kingside (e8g8):** Safe, connects rooks, prepares for kingside play.
2. **d6d5:** Strikes in the center, but White can respond with e4, opening lines.
3. **g7g6:** Prepares to fianchetto bishop, but weakens dark squares.
4. **h8g8:** Rook move, but castling is better.
5. **c8e6:** Develops bishop, but White can play c4, challenging the center.
6. **c8g4:** Pins bishop, but White can play h3, and after Bxf3, Qxf3, White has the bishop pair.
7. **a7a6:** Prevents Nb5, but not urgent.

**Deep analysis:**
- Castling is the most logical, safe, and flexible move. It brings the king to safety, connects the rooks, and prepares for a kingside attack (with h5, g4, etc.).
- d6d5 is tempting, but after e4, the center opens and White's pieces become active.
- c8g4 is interesting, but after h3, Bxf3, Qxf3, White's queen is active and Black has given up the bishop pair.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to castle kingside, ensuring king safety and preparing for future play.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 10. a4:**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1/h1, Bishops on f3/c1, Knights are gone, pawns on a4, b2, c2, d3, e3, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on g8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8/f8, Bishops on e7/c8, Knight on f6/c6, pawns on a7, b7, d6, e5, g5, g7, h7.

**Key features:**
- Black has a solid center and kingside, but White has space on the queenside (a4).
- White's bishop pair could become strong if the center opens.
- Black's pieces are well developed, but the c8 bishop is still undeveloped.
- Black's plan: finish development, possibly play ...d5 or ...g4 to gain space, or ...Be6 to challenge White's bishop.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Be6: Develops the bishop, connects the rooks, eyes the a2-g8 diagonal.
2. ...g4: Kicks the bishop, but after Bxg4, Nxg4, Qxg4, White is better developed.
3. ...d5: Opens the center, but White can play exd5, Nxd5, and White's bishops become active.
4. ...a6: Prevents a5, but not urgent.
5. ...Nb4: Eyes c2, but White can play c3.
6. ...Be6: Seems most logical, develops and connects rooks.

**Tactical checks:**
- Is ...g4 playable? 10...g4 11.Bxg4 Nxg4 12.Qxg4 f5 13.Qg3 f4 14.exf4 exf4 15.Bxf4 Bh4 16.Qe3 Re8, but White is better developed.
- Is ...d5 playable? 10...d5 11.exd5 Nxd5 12.Bxd5 Qxd5 13.e4 Qd8, but White has more space.

**Strategic plan:**
- Develop c8 bishop, connect rooks, then consider ...d5 or ...g4.
- ...Be6 is safe, solid, and flexible.

**Final move:**

2025-06-22 12:08:06,361 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.35s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 11. a4 h4**

- White's last move was h4, indicating kingside ambitions.
- Black's pieces are well developed, with a solid pawn structure.
- White's king is still in the center, but can castle kingside.
- Black has a slight space disadvantage but is well coordinated.
- White's bishop on f3 is strong, eyeing b7 and possibly h5 in the future.
- Black's dark-squared bishop on e7 is solid, and the knight on f6 is well placed.

**Candidate moves:**

1. **g5g4**: Kicks the bishop, but after Bxg4, Black loses the g-pawn and weakens the kingside.
2. **g7g6**: Solidifies the kingside, but does not address central tension.
3. **d6d5**: Strikes in the center, challenging White's pawn on e4 and opening lines for the pieces. If exd5, Nxd5, Black has good central control.
4. **f6d7**: Retreats the knight, but seems passive.
5. **e5e4**: Gains space, but White can play dxe4, and after Nxe4, Bxe4, dxe4, White can play dxe4 with a slight advantage.
6. **g8h8**: Moves the king to the corner, but unnecessary at this stage.
7. **a7a6** or **b7b6**: Prepares queenside expansion, but not urgent.

**Most promising:**
- **d6d5**: Central break, challenges White's center, opens lines for the bishop on e7 and queen, and fits with Black's development.

**Calculation after 11...d5:**
- 12. hxg5 (White tries to open the kingside) Nd7 (defending g5, preparing f5)
- 12. exd5 Nxd5 (centralizes the knight, threatens to jump to f4 or b4)
- 12. h5 (White pushes) h6 (solidifies kingside)

**Conclusion:**
- The central break **d6d5** is principled and strong, challenging White's center and opening lines for Black's pieces.

My move:
```
d6d5

2025-06-22 12:08:46,065 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-22 12:08:51,673 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.61s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:** Equal.
**King safety:** Both kings are castled, but White's kingside pawns are advanced (h5), which could be double-edged.
**Center:** Black has a strong center with pawns on d5 and e5, and a knight on c6.
**Piece activity:** Black's pieces are well-placed. White's bishop on f3 is active, but the rest are less so.

**White's threats:** 
- h5-h6 could open lines against Black's king.
- d3-d4 could challenge Black's center.
- The bishop on f3 eyes the d5 pawn.

**Black's plans:**
- Consider pushing g5-g4 to harass the bishop and gain space.
- Consider d5-d4 to close the center and restrict White's bishop.
- Consider g7-g6 to blunt h5-h6 ideas.
- Consider developing the queen (d8b6, d8a5, etc.) or rook (a8c8).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5-g4:** Attacks the bishop, but White can play Be2 or Bxg4. After g4, Be2, d4 is possible.
2. **g7-g6:** Prepares to meet h5-h6 with g6-g5, keeping the kingside closed.
3. **d5-d4:** Closes the center, but White can play Ne2 or exd4.
4. **d8b6:** Develops the queen, eyes b2 and possibly f2.
5. **a7a6:** Prevents b5, but not urgent.
6. **e5-e4:** Gains space, but White can play dxe4 or Be2.

**Critical lines:**
- If 1...g4 2. Be2 d4, White's bishop is less active, and Black has space.
- If 1...g6 2. hxg6 fxg6, White has opened the h-file, but Black's king is safe for now.
- If 1...d4 2. exd4 Nxd4, Black has a strong knight on d4.

**Risks:** 
- g4 can overextend if not supported.
- g6 can weaken the dark squares if White can open the h-file.

**Best move:** 
- **g4** is the most aggressive, gaining space and challenging White's bishop. It also supports a future d4 push and restricts White's kingside play.

Therefore, after careful consideration, the best move is:
```
g5g4
```

2025-06-22 12:10:21,840 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-22 12:10:27,921 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.08s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on f3, pawns on a5, b2, c2, d3, e3, f2, g2, h5.
- Black: King on g8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and f8, Bishop on e7, Knight on c6, Bishop on f6, pawns on a7, b7, d5, e5, g4, f7.

**Key features:**
- Black has a strong center and kingside pawn majority.
- White has a pawn on h5, which could become dangerous if White can open the h-file.
- Black's g4 pawn is cramping White's kingside.
- Black's pieces are well-coordinated, and White's queenside is underdeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g4xf3**: Captures a bishop, but White can recapture with Qxf3 or gxf3, opening the g-file.
2. **d5d4**: Pushes in the center, gaining space and attacking the bishop.
3. **d8a5**: Attacks the a5 pawn, but White can defend with Bd2.
4. **e5e4**: Attacks the bishop, but White can play Be2 or dxe4.
5. **g7g6**: Reinforces the g4 pawn, but is passive.
6. **f6e4**: Knight takes e4, but the bishop is on f6, not a knight.

**Critical calculation:**
- **g4xf3**: 1... gxf3 2. Qxf3 (if 2. gxf3, then d4 is strong) 2... d4 attacks the bishop, and if exd4, then Nxd4 is very strong for Black. White's king is still in the center.
- **d5d4**: 1... d4 2. Bxc6 bxc6 3. exd4 exd4 4. Ne4, White gets play.
- **e5e4**: 1... e4 2. dxe4 dxe4 3. Nxe4 Qxd1+ 4. Bxd1 Nxe4, Black is fine but not better.

**Best move:**
- **g4xf3** is the most forcing. If 2. Qxf3, then d4 is very strong, opening the center while White's king is still in the middle. If 2. gxf3, then d4 is also strong, and Black can follow up with Nd5 or Bg5.

Therefore, after careful analysis, the best move is:

```
g4f3
```

2025-06-22 12:12:04,804 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.87s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White's last move was Rh4, attacking the f3 pawn and possibly preparing to swing the rook to the kingside.
- Black's bishop on e7 is well placed, and the knight on f6 is defending key squares.
- Black's pawn on f3 is a thorn in White's position, but it is currently attacked by the rook on h4.
- White's king is on e1, not yet castled, and White's queenside is undeveloped.
- Black's king is castled kingside.

**Immediate Threats:**
- White threatens to capture on f3 with the rook (Rxh3).
- Black must consider how to defend or counter this threat.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **f3xg2**: Captures on g2, threatening to promote and opening the g-file. After Rxg2, White's rook is active, but Black has opened the g-file for counterplay.
2. **d5-d4**: Pushes the pawn, attacking the c3 knight and opening the center while White's king is still in the center.
3. **e5-e4**: Attacks the d3 pawn and restricts White's pieces.
4. **d8-c7**: Prepares to double rooks on the c-file or defend the f6 knight.
5. **e6-g4**: Bishop move, attacking the h5 pawn and possibly trading off White's active rook.
6. **g7-g6**: Defends the f5 square and prepares to push g5, but is slow.

**Critical Calculation:**
- If 1... f3xg2 2. Rh2, White threatens Qf3, but Black can play g7-g6, and White's attack is not immediate.
- If 1... d4, White can play exd4, and after Nxd4, White's king is still in the center, but Black's initiative is not clear.
- If 1... e4, White can play dxe4, and after dxe4, White can play d4, but Black's pieces are active.

**Best Move:**
The move **f3xg2** is the most forcing and creates immediate problems for White. If White recaptures with the rook, Black can play d4, opening the center while White's king is stuck in the center. If White plays Rh2, Black can continue with g6, solidifying the kingside.

**Final Move:**
```

2025-06-22 12:12:56,761 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.71s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White's king is on e1, and Black's king is on g8.
- Black has a pawn on g2, threatening to promote.
- White's rook is on h4, threatening to swing to the kingside or support h5-h6.
- Black's pieces are well developed, and the g2 pawn is a major asset.
- White's bishop is on d1, queen on d1, rook on a1, and the other rook on h4.
- Black's queen is on d8, bishop on e7, knight on f6 and c6, rook on a8 and f8.

**Immediate Tactical Considerations:**
- The pawn on g2 can promote, but White can respond with Rg4, attacking the promoted piece.
- If g2-g1=Q, White can play Rg4, and after Nxg4, Qxg4+, Black's king is relatively safe, but White gets some activity.
- If g2-g1=Q, and White plays Kd2 or something else, Black is up a queen.
- Is there a better move than promoting immediately? Let's check.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **g2g1=Q**: Promote the pawn to a queen.
2. **g2g1=N**: Underpromotion to a knight, but doesn't seem to offer more than a queen.
3. **g2g1=R/B**: Unlikely to be better than a queen.
4. **f6g4**: Knight takes h4, but the rook is not on h4, so not possible.
5. **e5e4**: Advance the e-pawn, but not as forcing as promoting.
6. **d5d4**: Advance the d-pawn, but again, not as forcing.
7. **Other piece moves**: None seem as strong as promoting.

**Calculation after g2g1=Q:**
- 1...g2g1=Q 2. Rg4 Nxg4 3. Qxg4+ Kh8 (or Kf7) and Black is up a queen for a rook and has a winning position.
- 1...g2g1=Q 2. Kd2 Qxd1+ 3. Kxd1 and Black is up a piece and a pawn, still winning.

**Conclusion:**
Promoting the pawn to a queen is the most forcing and best move, giving Black a decisive material advantage and no immediate counterplay for White.

Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 15... Qg1=Q 16. Kd2**

- Black: King on g8, Queen on g1, Rooks on a8, f8, Bishop on e7, Knight on f6, c6, Pawns on a7, b7, d5, e5, g7, f7, h7
- White: King on d2, Queen on d1, Rook on h4, Bishop on c1, Pawns on a5, b3, d3, e3, f2, h5

**Material:**
- Black is up a queen for a rook and pawn.
- White's king is exposed on d2.
- Black's queen is very active on g1.
- White's rook on h4 is awkwardly placed.
- Black's pieces are ready to join the attack.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens ...Qxf2+ (forking king and rook).
- White's king is very exposed.
- White's queen and bishop are undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Qxf2+ (immediate check, forces Kc3 or Qe2)
2. ...Ne4+ (check, but d2 is covered by the queen)
3. ...Ne4+ followed by ...Bxh4
4. ...Ne4+ followed by ...Bb4+ (if White plays Kc2)
5. ...d4 (open lines)
6. ...Ne8 (retreat, but unnecessary)
7. ...Qh2 (threatening mate on f2, but White can defend)

Let's analyze ...Qxf2+:

- 16... Qxf2+ 17. Qe2 (forced, otherwise Kc3 runs into ...Bb4#)
- 17... Qxh4 (winning the rook)
- 18. Ba3 (developing, but Black is up a queen for a rook and pawn, and White's king is still exposed)

Alternatively, after 16... Qxf2+ 17. Be2 (blocking with the bishop):

- 17... Qxh4 (again, winning the rook)
- 18. Bb2 (trying to develop, but Black is up a queen for a rook and pawn)

Alternatively, after 16... Qxf2+ 17. Kc3:

- 17... Bb4# is not possible because the bishop is on c1.
- 17... d4+ 18. Kc4 (king is running, but Black can continue the attack)

But the simplest is to take on f2, win the rook, and keep the attack going.

**Conclusion:** The best move is the forcing check, winning the rook and keeping the attack.

2025-06-22 12:15:34,110 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.82s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, Knight, 6 pawns
- White: Queen, Rook, Bishop, 5 pawns

**King safety:**
- Black's king is on g8, relatively safe.
- White's king is on d2, exposed and vulnerable.

**Threats:**
- Black's queen on f2 is very active, threatening f3+ and possibly e3.
- White's queen is on e2, rook on h4, bishop on c1, pawns on a5, b3, d3, e3, h5.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qf2xh4**: Captures the rook, but let's check for tactics.
2. **Qf2g1**: Not useful.
3. **Qf2e2**: Queen trade, but Black is up material.
4. **Qf2f5**: Attacks the bishop on e4, but not as forcing.
5. **Qf2f3**: Check, but White can block with Qe2 or Kd1.
6. **Qf2g2**: Not useful.

**If 1... Qxh4:**
- White can try Qg2+ or Qe1, but Black is up a rook and has a crushing attack.

**If 1... Qe2+:**
- White must trade queens, and Black is up a rook.

**If 1... Qf3:**
- White can play Qe2, and after Qxe2+, Kxe2, Black is up a rook.

**Best move:**
- Qxh4 wins a rook and maintains the attack.

**Check for tactics:**
- After Qxh4, White has no immediate checks or threats. Black is up a rook and has a winning position.

**Final move:**
```
f2h4
```

2025-06-22 12:20:01,573 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.20s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after move 17... Qh4:**

- Black: King on g8, Queen on h4, Rooks on a8 and f8, Bishop on e7 and f6, Knight on c6 and f6, pawns on a7, b7, d5, e5, g7, h7.
- White: King on d2, Queen on g2, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, pawns on a5, b3, d3, e3, h5.

**Material:**
- Black is up a piece (White has only a bishop and rook, Black has two bishops, two knights, two rooks).
- White's king is exposed on d2.
- Black's queen is aggressively placed on h4, eyeing h5 and g3.
- Black's pieces are well coordinated for an attack.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens ...Qxh5, winning a pawn.
- White's queen on g2 is defending, but there are no immediate threats from White.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Qxh5: Grabs a pawn, threatens ...Qxh5-h2, but White can try Ba3 or Bb2 to develop.
2. ...d4: Opens the center, but White's king is exposed; however, it gives White the e4 square.
3. ...e4: Kicks the bishop, but White has no bishop on f3.
4. ...Bb4: Pins the king to the queen, but White can play Kc2.
5. ...dxe4: Opens the d-file, but White can recapture with dxe4.
6. ...Qe1+: Forces the king to c2, but then what?
7. ...Qh2: Threatens mate, but White can block with Qe2.

**Tactical ideas:**
- ...Qxh5 is safe, as White cannot trap the queen.
- ...d4 is tempting, but White can play exd4, and after ...exd4, White can play Bb2, defending.
- ...Qe1+ is interesting: if Kc2, then ...Nb4+ is possible.

Let's calculate ...Qe1+:

18... Qe1+  
19. Kc2 Nb4+  
20. Kb2 Nxd3+  
21. Kc2 Nxc1  
But White can play Kb2, and the king escapes.

Alternatively, after ...Qe1+, White can block with Kc2, but then ...Nb4+ is strong.

Alternatively, ...Qxh5 is simple and keeps the advantage.

**Engine-like evaluation:**
- ...Qe1+ is forcing and may lead to a quick win.
- ...Qxh5 is safe and keeps the advantage.

Let's check ...Qe1+ in detail:

18... Qe1+  
19. Kc2 Nb4+  
20. Kb2 Nxd3+  
21. Kc2 Nxc1  
But after 21. ...Nxc1, White's queen is still on g2, and Black is up a piece.

Alternatively, after 18... Qe1+ 19. Kc2 Nb4+ 20. Kb2 Nxd3+ 21. Kc2 Nxc1 22. Rxc1 Qxe3, Black is winning.

**Conclusion:**  
The most forcing and best move is:

```
Qe1+
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Ke1):**
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8/f8, Bishop on e7, Knight on c6/f6, pawns on a7, b7, d5, e5, g7, h6.
- White: King on e1, Queen on g2, Rook on a1, Bishop on c1, pawns on a5, b3, c2, d3, e3, h4.

**Material:**
- Black is up a piece (two knights vs. one bishop).

3. ...Nb4: Attacks c2, but White can defend.
4. ...Qd7: Connects rooks, but not urgent.
5. ...Bb4: Pins the bishop, but White can play Bd2.

**Tactical considerations:**
- White's king is exposed.
- Black can try to open the center with ...d4.
- White's queen is on g2, not very active.

**Calculation for ...d4:**
- 19...d4 20. exd4 (if c3, then ...dxc3 and Black is better)
- 20...Nxd4 (threatening Nxc2+ and Nf3+)
- If 21. Bxh6, then Nxc2+ 22. Qxc2 gxh6 and Black is up material.

**Calculation for ...e4:**
- 19...e4 20. dxe4 dxe4 21. Nxe4 Nxe4 22. dxe4 Bf6, but White is solid.

**Calculation for ...Nb4:**
- 19...Nb4 20. Kd1 Rc8, but White can defend.

**Best move:**
- ...d4 opens the center, attacks e3, and threatens to activate the knights. White's king is exposed, and Black's pieces are ready to invade.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d5d4

2025-06-22 12:24:56,219 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.73s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/2n1bn1P/P3p3/3p4/1P1PP3/2P3Q1/R1B1K3 b - - 0 20

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8, f8; Queen on d8; Bishops on e7, f6; Knights on c6, f6; Pawns on a7, b7, d4, e5, g7, h6; King on g8.
- White: Rook on a1; Bishop on c1; Queen on g2; King on e1; Pawns on a5, b3, c2, d3, e3, h6.

**Key features:**
- White's king is on e1, somewhat exposed.
- White's h6 pawn is advanced but not immediately threatening.
- Black has a strong center and more active pieces.
- Black is up material (two bishops and a knight for a rook and bishop), and White's coordination is poor.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...g7g6 (prevents h6xg7, but not urgent as h6 is not attacking g7)
2. ...d4e3 (pawn break, opening lines towards White's king)
3. ...f6h7 (rerouting knight to threaten g5 and f3)
4. ...e7b4 (attacking a5 and c3)
5. ...d8a5 (threatening Qc3+ and pressure on a1)
6. ...e6g4 (threatening Nf2+ and opening lines)
7. ...f8e8 (centralizing rook)

**Critical lines:**
- ...d4e3 is very tempting, as it opens the d-file and threatens ...Nd4, ...Qd4, or ...Bb4+.
- ...d8a5 threatens ...Qc3+ and pressure on a1, but White can play Bd2.
- ...e6g4 threatens ...Nf2+ and ...Ne3, but White can play Qg3.

**Calculation:**
Let's look at ...d4e3:
- 20...d4e3 21.Bxe3 (forced) Nd4 (threatening Nxc2+ and Qd5)
- If 22.Bd2 Nxc2+ 23.Kd1 Nxa1, Black wins the rook.
- If 22.Qf2, then ...Ng4.

Alternatively, ...d4e3 21.Qxe3 Nd4 22.Qf2 Nxc2+ 23.Qxc2 Rc8, Black is dominating.

**Tactical check:**
- ...d4e3 is safe, as the pawn is protected and White's pieces are tied up.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is the pawn break ...d4e3, opening the position and exploiting White's weak king and poor coordination.

My move:
```
d4e3
```

2025-06-22 12:27:38,736 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.86s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Analysis:**
- Black to move.
- Material: Black is up a piece (bishop for a pawn).
- White's h6 pawn is advanced but not immediately threatening.
- White's queen is on g2, king on d1.
- Black's pieces are well developed, and the king is safe.
- White's king is exposed on d1, and the queen is far from the king.
- Black's knight on f6 and bishop on e7 are well placed.
- Black's pawn on e3 is a thorn in White's position, cramping White's king and bishop.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **e3e2+**: This is a forcing move, pushing the pawn to e2 with check, forcing White's king to move. After Kd2, Black can play ...Bb4+ or ...Nd4+.
2. **Nd4**: Immediate check, but White can block with Qf1 or c3.
3. **Bb4**: Immediate check, but White can block with c3.
4. **Qd4**: Queen invasion, but not check, and White can respond.
5. **e5e4**: Not forcing, and White can ignore it.

**Calculating e3e2+:**
- 21...e3e2+
  - 22. Kd2 (forced)
    - Now, Black can play:
      - ...Bb4+ (threatening to win material or force the king further into the open)
      - ...Nd4 (threatening ...Nf3+ or ...Qxa1)
      - ...Qd4 (centralizing queen, but not check)
- Let's look at 22...Bb4+:
  - 23. c3 (forced)
    - Now ...dxc3 is not possible, but ...Nd4 is strong, threatening ...Nxb3+ and ...Qxa1.
- Alternatively, after 21...e3e2+ 22. Kd2, 22...Nd4 is also strong, threatening ...Nf3+ and ...Qxa1.

**Is there a mate?**
- After 21...e3e2+ 22. Kd2 Bb4+ 23. c3 Nd4, White's king is in grave danger, and Black is winning at least a rook.

**Conclusion:**
The move 21...e3e2+ is the most forcing and strongest, as it drives the king further into the open and sets up devastating threats.

My move:
```
e3e2
```

2025-06-22 12:29:57,978 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.84s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Ke2):**

- Black: King on f6, Queen on d8, Rook on a8, Bishop on e7, Knight on c6, pawns on a7, b7, e5, g7, f6.
- White: King on e2, Queen on g2, Bishop on c1, pawns on a5, b3, c2, d3, h6.

**Material:**
- Black is up a piece (White has only a bishop for Black's bishop and knight).
- White's h6 pawn is advanced and could be dangerous if supported.
- White's king is exposed on e2.

**Threats:**
- Black can consider ...Nd4+ to harass the White king.
- Black can consider ...Qd4, ...Nd4, or ...Nd4+ to exploit the exposed king.
- Black can also consider ...g6 to stop h7 ideas, but that's not urgent yet.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. ...Nd4+ (immediate check, king must move, and then ...Nxc2 is possible)
2. ...Qd4 (centralizing queen, attacking pawn on a1, but White can block with Be3)
3. ...Qd7 (preparing ...Qg4+ or ...Qg4, but not direct)
4. ...Qd6 (threatening ...Nd4+ and ...Qb4)
5. ...g6 (preventing h7, but not urgent)
6. ...Rh8 (bringing rook to h-file, but slow)

**Let's calculate ...Nd4+:**

- 1...Nd4+ 2.Kd1 (if Kf2, then ...Nxc2 wins a pawn)
- 1...Nd4+ 2.Kf2 Nxc2 3.Ra2 (to defend c2) but then ...Nb4 and Black is up two pawns and has a dominating position.

Alternatively, after ...Nd4+ 2.Kd1, Black can play ...Nxc2, and White can't recapture because the king is on d1.

**Is there any tactical shot with ...Nd4+?**
- 1...Nd4+ 2.Kd1 Nxc2 3.Kxc2 Rc8+ 4.Kb2 Qd4+ 5.Ka2 Rc2+ and mate is coming.

So ...Nd4+ is a strong move, winning material and exposing the king further.

**Final Decision:**
The best move is:
```
c6d4
```

2025-06-22 12:32:41,442 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.47s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 22...Kf2:**
- Black: King on f2, Queen on g2, Bishop on c1, Pawn on h6, b3, c2, d3, a5, b2, f3, g7, h7, Rook on a1, f1, Knight on d4, f6, Bishop on e7, e6, Rook on f8, Queen on d8, a8.
- White: King on f2, Queen on g2, Bishop on c1, Pawn on h6, b3, c2, d3, a5, b2, f3, g7, h7, Rook on a1, f1, Knight on d4, f6, Bishop on e7, e6, Rook on f8, Queen on d8, a8.

But let's clarify: Black to move. White's king is on f2, queen on g2, pawn on h6, etc. Black has a strong position, with a knight on d4, bishop on e7, queen on d8, rook on f8, and so on.

**Key features:**
- White's king is exposed on f2.
- Black's knight on d4 is very powerful, controlling many squares.
- Black's queen on d8 can swing to the kingside.
- White's pawn on h6 is advanced but not immediately threatening.
- Black's bishop on e7 is well placed, and the rook on f8 eyes the f-file.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ng4+** (f6g4): Immediate check, forcing the king to move or queen to block.
2. **Nxe4+** (d4e4): Captures a pawn with check, but White can block with dxe4.
3. **Qd7**: Preparing Qg4+ or Qh3.
4. **Ng4+** is the most forcing.

Let's look at **1...Ng4+**:
- If 2.Kg1, then Qd4+ picks up the queen on g2.
- If 2.Ke1, then Nxc2+ wins the rook on a1.
- If 2.fxg4, then Nxg4+ is not possible since the pawn is on h6, not g4.

But let's check the position: White's queen is on g2, king on f2, pawn on h6, bishop on c1, rook on a1, etc.

If **1...Ng4+**:
- 2.Kg1 Qd4+ 3.Kh1 Qxa1, winning the rook.
- 2.Ke1 Nxc2+ 3.Qxc2 Qxa1+, again winning material.

**Is there a mate?**
- After 1...Ng4+ 2.Kg1 Qd4+ 3.Kh1 Qxa1, Black is up a rook and has a winning position.

**Other candidate moves:**
- Qd7, Qc7, but none are as forcing as Ng4+.

**Conclusion:** The best move is the forcing check **Ng4+**.

Let's analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- White's king is on g1, and the queen is on g2.
- Black has a strong knight on d4, a bishop on e6, and another bishop on e7.
- White's pawn on h6 is advanced but not immediately threatening.
- Black's pieces are well-coordinated, and White's king is somewhat exposed.
- Black's knight on g4 is attacking h6 and f2, and can jump to e3 or h2.
- White's queen on g2 is defending g1 and h3.
- Black's queen on d8 is centralized and can swing to the kingside or queenside.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Nf3+**: Knight check, forcing the king to h1 or f1. If Kh1, then Qd7 threatens Qh3+.
2. **Ne2+**: Knight check, but White can capture with the queen.
3. **Nxh6**: Captures the pawn, but White can respond with Bxh6.
4. **Qd7**: Threatens Qh3, but White can defend with Qf2.
5. **Bg5**: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qxg4.
6. **Nf5**: Attacks the queen, but White can move the queen.
7. **Qd4+**: Not possible, as the queen is blocked by the knight.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- The move **Nf3+** is very forcing. Let's calculate:
    - 1...Nf3+ 2. Kh1 (if Kf1, then Bh3 is crushing)
    - After 2. Kh1, Black can play Qd7, threatening Qh3#.
    - White's only defense is to play Qf2, but then Black can play Qh3+ and after Kg1, Qh2+ and Qh1# is unstoppable.

Let's check the lines:
1...Nf3+ 2. Kh1 Qd7 3. Qf2 Qh3+ 4. Qh2 Qxh2#

This is a forced mate.

**Final Move:**
```
g4f3

Thank you for your patience. Let's carefully analyze the position and the legal moves provided.

**Position Recap:**
- Black to move.
- White's king is on g1, queen on g2, pawn on h6.
- Black's knight on d4, bishop on e6 and e7, queen on d8, rook on f8, knight on g4.
- Black's knight on g4 attacks h6 and f2, but not f3 (since the pawn on h6 blocks the f3 square).

**Immediate Tactical Checks:**
- No checks are available with the knight or queen.
- No captures with check.
- No direct threats of mate in one.

**Key Candidate Moves:**
- **Ne2+** is not legal (not in the list).
- **Nxh6** is not legal (not in the list).
- **Qd7** is not legal (not in the list).
- **g4h6** (Knight takes h6) is legal, but let's see if it's safe: after g4h6, White can play Bxh6, exchanging off a strong attacking piece.
- **e5e4** (pawn push) is legal, attacking the queen and opening lines.
- **d4f3** (knight to f3) is not legal.
- **g4e3** (knight to e3) is legal, forking the queen and bishop.

**Let's analyze g4e3:**
- 1...Ng3-e3 attacks the queen on g2 and the bishop on c2.
- If White plays Qxg7#, it's mate, so this is not possible.
- But after 1...Ne3, White's queen is still on g2, and Black is threatening to win material.

**Is there a mate threat for White?**
- White's queen on g2 is aiming at g7, but the pawn is still on g7, so no immediate mate.

**Other candidate moves:**
- **e5e4**: attacks the queen, but after dxe4, White opens the d-file.
- **g4e3**: attacks the queen and bishop, and if White moves the queen, Black can take the bishop on c2.

**Conclusion:**
The move **g4e3** (Ng4-e3) is a strong tactical move, forking the queen and bishop, and White cannot ignore it.

**Final move:**
```
g4e3
```

2025-06-22 12:38:22,259 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.35s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Qe4):**

- White: Kg1, Qe4, Ra1, Bc1, b3, c2, h6, a5
- Black: Kg8, Qd8, Ra8, Bc8, Be7, N(d4), N(e3), b7, e5, f7, g7, h7

**Key features:**
- White's king is on g1, relatively safe for now.
- White's h6 pawn is advanced and could be dangerous if supported.
- Black has a powerful knight on d4 and another on e3, both centralized and aggressive.
- Black's dark-squared bishop on e7 is eyeing the h4 square and can be very dangerous.
- White's queen is centralized but not threatening immediate tactics.
- Black is up material (White is down a rook for a pawn).

**Immediate tactics:**
- The knight on e3 attacks both the queen on e4 and the g2 square (potential mate threats).
- The knight on d4 covers key central squares.
- The bishop on e7 can go to g5 or h4, threatening mate ideas.
- Black can consider Qd1+ or Qd5, but White's queen covers d5.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ne3xc2**: Forks the queen and rook, but after Qxc2, Black is still up material.
2. **Ne3g4**: Attacks the queen and threatens Qd1+ ideas.
3. **Ne3f5**: Attacks the queen and covers h6.
4. **Qd1+**: Not possible, as the queen is on e4.
5. **Nexg2**: Not possible.
6. **Qd5**: Not possible, as the queen is on e4.
7. **Bg5**: Pins the queen to the king, but the king is on g1, so not effective.
8. **Nf5**: Attacks the queen and covers h6.

**Best move:**
- **Ne3xc2**: This move attacks the queen and the rook on a1. If White plays Qxc2, Black is still up a rook for a pawn. If White moves the queen, Black wins the rook on a1.

Let's check for any tactics for White after Ne3xc2:
- If Qxc2, Black is still up material.
- If Qxe5, White threatens mate on g7, but Black can defend with Bf6 or Qf6.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play Ne3xc2, attacking the queen and rook, and maintaining a decisive material advantage.

2025-06-22 12:41:43,545 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black to move.
- White's king is on g2, somewhat exposed.
- Black has a powerful knight on d4, a bishop on e6, and a bishop on e7.
- Black's queen is on d8, rooks on a8 and f8.
- White has a dangerous pawn on h6, but it's not immediately threatening.
- White's pieces are awkward: bishop on c1, rook on a1, queen on e4, and a pawn on b3.
- Black's knight on c2 is attacking b4 and e3 squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4xb3** (Knight takes b3): Attacks the rook on a1 and threatens to win material.
2. **d4c2** (Retreat): Not necessary, as the knight is strong.
3. **e6d5** (Bishop attacks queen): Forces the queen to move, but may not be best.
4. **e6f5** (Bishop attacks queen): Similar idea.
5. **d8d5** (Queen attacks queen): Offers a queen trade, but White's queen is more active.
6. **c2b4** (Knight attacks queen): Forces the queen to move, but the knight is very strong on d4.

**Tactical considerations:**
- d4xb3 threatens the rook and the bishop on c1, and White can't easily defend both.
- After d4xb3, if White plays Rb1, then Nxa1 wins the exchange.
- If White plays Bb2, then Nxa1 is still possible.
- White's queen is not in a position to deliver any immediate threats.

**Checking for tactics:**
- Is there any immediate mate threat from White? No.
- Is there any counterplay? Not really, as Black's pieces are well placed.

**Conclusion:**
The move **d4xb3** wins material and puts pressure on White. It's the best move.

2025-06-22 12:45:27,680 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.57s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Kg3):**
- Black to move.
- Material: Black is up a piece (White has a dangerous h6 pawn, but Black has two knights and a bishop for White's rook and pawn).
- White's king is exposed on g3, but Black's king is relatively safe.
- White's threats: The h6 pawn is dangerous, but currently not queening. White's queen is active on e4, but not immediately threatening mate.
- Black's threats: Black has a knight on b3, a bishop on e7, and a bishop on e6. The queen is on d8. Black can consider attacking the White king or defending against the h6 pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxa1** (c2a1): Captures the rook, but leaves the knight on the edge and doesn't address the h6 pawn or White's queen activity.
2. **Nxa3** (c2a3): Attacks the queen, but the queen can move with check (Qxe5+), which could be dangerous.
3. **Nd4** (c2d4): Attacks the queen, but again, Qxe5+ is possible.
4. **Qd4** (d8d4): Queen takes queen, but after exd4, White's king is still exposed, but Black is up material.
5. **Bh4+** (e7h4): Bishop check, but White can block with Kg2 or Kh2.
6. **Nc5** (b3c5): Retreats the knight, but loses the exchange on a8.
7. **Qd3** (d8d3): Queen check, but White can block with Be3 or Kh2.

**Critical lines:**
- If Black plays **Qd4** (queen takes queen), after exd4, Black is up a piece and White's king is still exposed. The h6 pawn is still dangerous, but Black can try to blockade it.
- If Black plays **Nxa1**, White can play Qxe5, threatening mate on g7, but Black can defend with Bf6.
- If Black plays **Nd4**, White can play Qxe5, again threatening mate.

**Best move:**
- **Qd4** is the most forcing. It exchanges queens, eliminates White's attacking potential, and leaves Black up a piece. After exd4, Black can then focus on blockading the h6 pawn and converting the material advantage.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d8d4
```

2025-06-22 12:47:55,384 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.27s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black to move.
- Material: Black is up a piece (two bishops vs. bishop and knight), but White has a dangerous passed h6 pawn on h6 and a strong bishop on f4.
- White's king is on g3, somewhat exposed, but Black's king on h7 is also not perfectly safe.
- Black has a knight on b3, which is deep in White's territory and can be a strong asset.
- Black's queen on d4 is very active, eyeing the kingside and central files.
- White's bishop on f4 is strong, but Black's bishops are also well-placed.
- White's knight on c2 is not very active.

**Immediate Threats:**
- White threatens to push h6-h7, but currently, the pawn is blockaded.
- Black's queen on d4 is very active and can threaten checks or mate ideas.
- Black's knight on b3 attacks a1 and c1, but those are not critical squares right now.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qxf4+**: Captures the bishop, but after Kxf4, White's king is centralized but exposed. However, this loses the queen for a bishop, so not good.
2. **Qxa1**: Captures the rook, but after Rxa1, not much is gained.
3. **Qd3+**: Check, but after Kg2, not much follow-up.
4. **exf4+**: Not possible.
5. **Nxa1**: Captures the rook, but not urgent.
6. **Qf4+**: Queen takes bishop with check, but after Kxf4, not enough compensation.
7. **Qd4xf4+**: Same as above.
8. **Qd4g1+**: Forcing the king to h3 or f3. Let's see:
   - Qg1+ Kg3 (forced), then Qxa1, but White can try to activate.
9. **Qd4g1+**: If Kg3, then Qxa1, but White's king is still exposed.

**Tactical Ideas:**
- Black can consider Qg1+ to force the king to the third rank, then try to grab material or continue the attack.
- The knight on b3 can take on a1, grabbing the rook.
- The bishop on e6 can move to h3, threatening mate on g2, but White's king is not on g2.

**Long-term Strategy:**
- Black is up material and should try to exchange queens or continue the attack.
- The h6 pawn is dangerous but currently blockaded.
- Black should avoid unnecessary complications and try to consolidate the material advantage.

**Best Move Calculation:**
- **Qd4g1+**: Forces the king to the third rank.
- After Qg1+, Kg3, Qxa1, Black wins a rook.
- White's only compensation is the h6 pawn, but Black can blockade it.

**Double-checking for tactics:**
- After Qg1+, Kg3, Qxa1, White has no immediate threats.
- If White tries h7, Black can play Qg7+ and pick up the pawn.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play **Qg1+**, forcing the king further into the open and then capturing the rook on a1, consolidating the material advantage.

2025-06-22 12:48:12,849 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.60s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (Kf3):**
- Black to move.
- Material: Black is up a full rook (White has no rooks, Black has both). Black also has a dangerous passed b3-knight and a queen on g1, with White's king exposed on f3.
- White's threats: The h6 pawn is advanced, but White has no immediate threats. The bishop on f4 is strong but not attacking anything critical.
- Black's threats: The queen on g1 is menacing, and White's king is very exposed. Black can look for direct mating nets or decisive material gain.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. **Qg4+** (g1g4): This checks the king and forces it to move. Let's see the king's options:
   - If Kf2, then Qxf4+ wins the bishop.
   - If Ke3, then Qxf4+ wins the bishop.
   - If Ke4, then Qxf4# is mate.
   - If Kf3, illegal (already on f3).
   - If Ke2, then Qxf4 is check and wins the bishop.

2. **Qh1+** (g1h1): This checks, but White can play Ke3 or f2, and Black doesn't have a follow-up.

3. **Nd4+** (b3d4): This is a check, but White can play Ke4, and then Black can play Qxf4#.

4. **Qf1+** (g1f1): This is a check, but White can play Ke4, and then Qxf4#.

But let's check the most forcing move: **Qg4+** (g1g4).

- 30...Qg4+
  - If Kf2, Qxf4+ wins the bishop and threatens mate.
  - If Ke3, Qxf4+ wins the bishop and threatens mate.
  - If Ke4, Qxf4# is mate.

So after 30...Qg4+, White is forced to lose the bishop or get mated. This is the most direct and decisive move.

**Final move:**
```
g1g4
```

2025-06-22 12:48:22,198 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.85s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8 and f8, Bishop on e6 and e7, Queen is missing, Knight on b3 and c2, pawns on a5, b7, e5, g7, f7, h7, King on h7.
- White: King on f2, Bishop on f4, pawn on d3, h6, a5.

**Position:**
- White's pawn on h6 is very dangerous, threatening h7-h8=Q soon.
- Black's queen is gone, but Black has two rooks and two bishops, and two knights, so a huge material advantage.
- White's king is exposed on f2.
- Black's queen is missing, but the material is overwhelming, and White's king is vulnerable.

**Immediate threats:**
- White threatens to promote h6-h7-h8=Q.
- Black can try to give checks or mate White's king, or stop the h-pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...g4-g6: Check, but White can block with the bishop or move the king.
2. ...g4-g6+ K moves, then what? No immediate mate.
3. ...g4-h5: Threatens mate on h2, but White can play g4.
4. ...g4-g5: Threatens to take on f4, but not forcing.
5. ...g4-f4+: Bishop takes.
6. ...g4-h4: Threatens mate on h2, but White can play g4.
7. ...g7-g5: Blocks the h-pawn, but White can play Bxg5.
8. ...g7-g6: Blocks h6, but White can play Bxe5.
9. ...g7-h6: Blocks h6, but White can play Bxe5.

**Critical lines:**
- If ...g4-h5, White can play g4, but then ...Qh2+ is mate, but there is no queen.
- If ...g4-g6+, White can play Ke3 or Kg2.
- If ...g7-g5, White can play Bxg5.

**Best move:**
- The move ...g4-g6+ is a check, and White's king is exposed. Let's see if this leads to mate or a decisive attack.

1. ...g4-g6+ 
   - If Ke3, then ...Bc5+ wins the queen.
   - If Kg2, then ...Ne3+ is possible.

But wait, the move list says "g4g6" is legal, which is a queen move. But Black has no queen. This must be a typo; perhaps it's a rook move from g4 to g6, but Black has no rook on g4. The only piece on g4 is the queen, but Black's queen is gone.

But the FEN says "5Bq1", so Black does have a queen on g4. So the move g4g6+ is a queen move.

So, let's try ...Qg6+.

1. ...Qg6+
   - If Ke3, then ...Bc5+ is devastating.
   - If Kg2, then ...Ne3+ is crushing.

Let's check the lines:

A) 31...Qg6+ 32.Ke3
   - ...Bc5+ 33.d4 (forced) Bxd4+ 34.Kf3 Qg4#

B) 31...Qg6+ 32.Kg2
   - ...Ne3+ 33.Bxe3 Qxg3+ 34.Kf1 Qxe3

C) 31...Qg6+ 32.Kf3
   - ...Nd4+ 33.Ke3 exf4+ 34.gxf4 Qg3+ 35.Kd2 Qe3+ 36.Kc3 Qe1#

So, 31...Qg6+ is a crushing move, leading to mate or decisive material gain.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g4g6
```

**FEN:** r4r2/pp2bppk/4b1qP/P3p3/5B2/1n1P4/2n1K3/R7 b - - 7 32

**Material count:**
- Black: Rooks (a8, f8), Bishop (e6, e7), Knight (b3, c2), Queen (g6), Pawns (a7, b7, f7, g7, h7)
- White: King (e2), Bishop (f4), Pawn (h6), Rook (a1), Pawn (a5), Pawn (d3)

**White's king is exposed on e2. Black has a powerful queen on g6, and White's h6 pawn is advanced but not immediately threatening. Black's knight on b3 is very strong, and the c2 knight is also well-placed. Black's pieces are much more active, and White's king is in danger.**

**Immediate tactical ideas:**
- The White king is on e2, and the queen on g6 is eyeing e4, g4, and g2.
- The bishop on e7 can move to g5, pinning the bishop on f4 to the king.
- The move Qg4+ is not possible because the king is not on the back rank.
- The move Qg2+ is not possible because the king is on e2.
- The move Qg4 is possible, attacking the bishop on f4 and threatening Qg2+ if the king moves.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qg4**: Attacks the bishop on f4, threatens Qg2+ if the king moves, and keeps pressure.
2. **Bg4+**: Not possible, as the bishop is on e7 and can't reach g4.
3. **Qg2+**: Not possible, as the king is on e2.
4. **Nd4+**: Not possible, as the knight is on c2 and b3.
5. **Qf5**: Attacks the bishop on f4 and keeps pressure.
6. **Qh5**: Not very effective.
7. **Qh6**: Not effective.
8. **Qf6**: Not effective.
9. **Qe4+**: Not possible, as the queen is on g6.

**Let's check Qg4:**
- If 32...Qg4+ 33. Kf2 (or Ke3), then Qg2+ is mate because the king is boxed in by its own pieces and Black's pieces.
- If 32...Qg4+ 33. Ke1, then Qg1# is mate.
- If 32...Qg4+ 33. Kf1, then Qg2# is mate.

**Therefore, Qg4+ is a forced mate in 1 or 2, depending on where the king goes.**

**Best move:**
```
g6g4

2025-06-22 12:48:36,609 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.48s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black: King on h7, Rooks on a8 and f8, Bishop on e6 and e7, Knight on b3 and c2, Queen on g4, pawns on a5, b7, d3, f7, g7.
- White: King on f2, Bishop on f4, Pawn on h6, a5, d3.

**Material:**
- Black is up significant material (Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights vs. White's lone Bishop and pawns).
- White's king is exposed on f2.
- White's pawn on h6 is advanced, but not immediately threatening.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- Black's queen on g4 is very active, eyeing g2 and f3.
- White's king is vulnerable, and Black has multiple pieces ready to attack.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qxf4+** (g4f4): Captures the bishop with check. White must recapture with the king (Kxf4), after which Black can continue the attack.
2. **Qh4+** (g4h4): Forces the king to move, but doesn't seem as forcing as Qxf4+.
3. **Qh3** (g4h3): Threatens mate on g2, but White can defend with Rg1 or move the king.
4. **Bh4+** (e7h4): Not possible, as the bishop is blocked.
5. **Qh5** (g4h5): Threatens Qh2+, but White can defend.

**Calculation:**
- **Qxf4+** (g4f4) seems the most forcing.
    - 1... Qxf4+ 2. Bxf4 (forced) exf4
    - Now, Black threatens ...g5, trapping the bishop, and the White king is still exposed.
    - Alternatively, after 1... Qxf4+ 2. Ke2 (if White tries to run), Black can continue with ...Nd4+ or ...Bg4+.

- **Qh4+** (g4h4) 2. Bg3 Qxh6, but this is less forcing.

- **Qh3** (g4h3) 2. Rg1 (if available), but White doesn't have a rook.

**Check for Mates:**
- After Qxf4+, White's king is forced to move or recapture, but no immediate mate.

**Other Forcing Moves:**
- **Nd4** (c2d4) with check, but the king can escape to e3.
- **Bh4+** is not possible.

**Conclusion:**
- **Qxf4+** is the most forcing move, wins a piece, and keeps the attack going.

**Final Move:**
```
g4f4
```

2025-06-22 12:48:41,978 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.88s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: 2 rooks, 2 bishops, queen, 2 knights, 5 pawns
- White: rook, king, h6 pawn

**White's threats:**
- The h6 pawn is advanced, but White's king is exposed and White has almost no pieces left.
- No immediate mate threats.

**Black's threats:**
- Black has a massive material advantage.
- White's king is on g1, exposed.
- Black's queen is on f4, ready to attack.
- Black has a bishop on e6, bishop on e7, knight on b3, knight on c2, and two rooks on a8 and f8.
- The h6 pawn could be a concern if it promotes, but Black can easily stop it.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qf2+** (not available, no f2 pawn)
2. **Qe3+** (f4e3): Check, forces Kh1 or Kf1, but after Kh1, Black can continue the attack.
3. **Qf1+** (f4f1): Check, forces Kh2, then Qh3# is mate.
4. **Qh4** (f4h4): Threatens mate on h1, but not immediate.
5. **Qxh6** (not available, pawn on h6)
6. **Qf6** (f4f6): Prepares to double up on f-file, but not immediate.
7. **Rf8g8** (f8g8): Threatens mate on g2, but not immediate.

**Check for forced mates:**
- **Qf1+** (f4f1): White must play Kh2, then Qh3# is mate.

Let's verify:
1. f4f1+ Kh2 (only move)
2. f1h3#

This is a forced mate in two.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f4f1

2025-06-22 12:48:57,995 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.55s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position Analysis:**
- Black: King on h7, rooks on a8 and f8, bishop on e6 and e7, knight on b3 and c2, pawns on a7, b7, d3, e5, f7, g7, h6.
- White: King on g1, rook on f1, pawn on h6, a5, d3.

**Material:**
- Black is up a piece (two bishops and two knights vs rook and pawn).
- White has a dangerous passed pawn on h6, but it's blockaded for now.
- Black's pieces are very active, and White's king is exposed.

**Threats:**
- White's only real threat is the h6 pawn, but it can't promote immediately.
- Black can consider attacking the White king, especially with the bishop pair and active knights.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **f8g8**: Bring the rook to the open g-file, potentially threatening g2 and supporting a kingside attack.
2. **f8h8**: Double up on the h-file, but White's king is not on the h-file.
3. **e7g5**: Attack the h6 pawn directly, but White can defend with Kg2.
4. **e6g4**: Threaten to exchange on g4, but White's rook can move.
5. **c2d4**: Knight to d4, centralizing and threatening Ne2+.
6. **b3d4**: Same idea as above.
7. **e5e4**: Push the pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.

**Deep Calculation:**
- **f8g8**: If 36. Kh2, then ...Nd4 threatens Nf3+ and Ne2+.
- **c2d4**: If 36. Kh2, then ...Ne2, and if 37. Rf2, then ...Nxg3.
- **e7g5**: If 36. Kg2, then ...Nd4, threatening Ne2+.

**Tactical Motifs:**
- The White king is exposed, and Black's knights can jump in with checks.
- The h6 pawn is not immediately dangerous.

**Best Move:**
- **f8g8** is strong, bringing the rook to the open file and threatening to invade via g2. It also keeps the f-file covered, preventing White's rook from becoming active.

**Final Move:**
```
f8g8
```

2025-06-22 12:49:09,389 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.87s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8 and g8, Bishop on e7 and e6, Knight on b3 and c2, Pawns on a5, b7, e5, g7, h7, King on h7
- White: Rook on f2, Pawn on h6, King on g1

**Key points:**
- Black is up a full piece (two knights vs. one rook), and has a dominating position.
- The pawn on h6 is advanced, but not immediately dangerous.
- White's rook is on f2, not very active.
- Black's knights are centralized and can create threats.
- Black's king is relatively safe on h7.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g7g6**: Prevents h6-h7, but White can't play h7 anyway.
2. **g8h8**: Moves the rook to a safer square, but not very active.
3. **e7g5**: Threatens to exchange a strong bishop for the rook, but the rook can move.
4. **c2d4**: Knight to d4, attacking the rook and threatening forks.
5. **b3d4**: Same idea, but from the other knight.
6. **e5e4**: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.
7. **a8f8**: Doubles rooks on the f-file, aiming at f2.
8. **g7h6**: Moves the king's pawn, but doesn't change much.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The knight on c2 can go to d4, attacking the rook and threatening forks.
- The bishop on e7 can go to g5, attacking the rook.
- Rook a8 to f8 doubles on the f-file, threatening f2.

**Calculation:**
- **c2d4**: If 36...Nc2-d4 37. Rf1 (only safe square), then ...Bh3 threatens mate on g2. If 38. Re1, then ...Nf3+ is a fork.
- **a8f8**: If 36...Ra8-f8 37. Rxf8 Bxf8, White has no threats, but Black's pieces are more active.
- **e7g5**: If 36...Be7-g5 37. Rg2, not much achieved.

**Best move:**
- **c2d4** is very strong, attacking the rook and threatening forks. If the rook moves, ...Bh3 is crushing.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c2d4
```

2025-06-22 12:49:18,911 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8 and g8, Bishop on e7 and e6, Knights on b3 and d4, pawns on a5, b7, e5, g7, h7, King on h7.
- White: Rook on b2, pawn on h6, King on g1.

**Threats:**
- White's pawn on h6 is advanced and could be dangerous if supported.
- Black has a strong knight on d4, and a knight on b3.
- Black's pieces are very active, and White's king is exposed.
- Black has a huge material advantage (two rooks, two bishops, two knights vs. a rook and a pawn).

**Immediate tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate or a way to win more material?
- The White king is on g1, and the only defender is the rook on b2.
- Black can consider ...g8-g6 to threaten mate on g1, but the rook on b2 covers g2.
- ...Nd4-f3+ is a check, but after g1-f2, nothing immediate.
- ...Nb3-d4-f3+ followed by ...B-e7-h4 is a possible idea, but White's king can escape to f1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Nd4-f3+ (check)
2. ...Be6-g4 (threatening ...Ne2+)
3. ...g8-g6 (threatening ...Rg1+)
4. ...Nb3-d4 (already on d4)
5. ...Be7-h4 (threatening mate ideas)
6. ...a5-a4 (not urgent)
7. ...h7-h6 (not urgent)
8. ...e5-e4 (not urgent)

**Calculating ...Nf3+:**
- 1...Nf3+ 2.Kf2 (forced) Bh4+ 3.Ke3 (only move) Rg3 4.Bxf3 Rxf3+ 5.Kxf3 (White is mated after ...Rg8-g3#)
- Wait, after 1...Nf3+ 2.Kf2 Bh4+ 3.Ke3 Rg3 4.Bxf3 Rxf3+ 5.Kxf3 Rg8, White is mated.

But after 1...Nf3+ 2.Kf2 Bh4+ 3.Ke3 Rg3 4.Bxf3 Rxf3+ 5.Kxf3 Rg8, White has to block with Rg2, but then ...Rxg2 is mate.

**So, let's check:**
1...Nf3+ 2.Kf2 Bh4+ 3.Ke3 Rg3 4.Bxf3 Rxf3+ 5.Kxf3 Rg8 6.Rg2 Rxg2 7.Kxg2 (forced) Bg4 and White is mated.

Alternatively, after 1...Nf3+ 2.Kf2 Bh4+ 3.Ke3 Rg3 4.Bxf3 Rxf3+ 5.Kxf3 Rg8, if White plays Ke2, then ...Rg2+ wins the rook.

This is a forced mate sequence.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
d4f3

2025-06-22 12:49:31,458 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.87s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black: King on h7, Rook on a8, Rook on g8, Bishop on e7 and e6, Knight on f3 and b3, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g7, h6
- White: King on f1, Rook on b2, Pawn on d3, h6, a5

**Material:**
- Black is up a piece (two bishops and two knights vs. rook and pawns).
- White's h6 pawn is advanced and dangerous, but currently blockaded by Black's king.

**Threats:**
- White's rook is active on b2, but not threatening immediate tactics.
- Black's knight on f3 is extremely strong, controlling key squares around White's king.
- Black's bishop pair is powerful, and the knight on b3 is also well-placed.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8g1+** (not legal, rook is on g8, but White's king is on f1, so not possible)
2. **f3d4** (centralizes knight, attacks b2 rook and e2 square, but allows White to play Rxb7)
3. **e6h3** (threatens mate on g2, but White can defend with Rf2)
4. **e7h4** (threatens mate on g3, but White can defend)
5. **g8g6** (not legal, rook is blocked by pawn)
6. **g7g6** (prepares to bring rook to g8-h8, but weakens kingside)
7. **e5e4** (opens up bishop, but doesn't create immediate threats)
8. **b3d4** (attacks rook, but White can play Rxb7)
9. **f3g5** (threatens mate on h3, but White can defend)
10. **g8h8** (prepares to double rooks on h-file, but slow)

**Critical tactical ideas:**
- Black's knight on f3 is a monster, and White's king is exposed.
- If Black can bring a rook to g1 or h1, it's mate.
- The bishop on e6 can swing to h3 or g4 for mating nets.
- The move **e7h4** threatens mate on g3, and if White plays Rg2, then Bh3 is mate.

**Calculation:**
- **e7h4** threatens Bh3# (if White plays Rg2, then Bh3# is mate).
- After **e7h4**, White has no way to stop Bh3# except by giving up the rook with Rg2.

**Verification:**
1. **e7h4**
   - Threat: Bh3#
   - If White plays Rg2, then Bh3# is mate.
   - If White plays any rook move, Bh3# is still mate.
   - If White plays d4, Bh3# is still mate.
   - If White plays Rxb3, Bh3# is still mate.

Therefore, **e7h4** is a forced mate in one (after Rg2), or mate in two otherwise.

**Final move:**
```
e7h4
```

2025-06-22 12:49:41,695 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.89s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black: King on h7, Rooks on a8 and g8, Bishop on e6 and h4, Knights on b3 and f3, pawns on a5, b7, e5, d3, f7, g7, h6.
- White: King on e2, Rook on b2, Pawn on h6, a5, d3.

**Material:**
- Black is up a piece (two bishops and two knights vs rook and pawn).
- White's h6 pawn is advanced and could be dangerous if supported.
- Black's pieces are very active and White's king is exposed.

**Tactical and Strategic Considerations:**
- The White king is on e2, exposed.
- Black's knight on f3 is very strong, threatening discovered checks and attacks.
- The bishop on h4 is eyeing e1 and f2, and the bishop on e6 is central.
- The rook on b2 is White's only active piece.
- Black has a mating net possibility due to the exposed White king and the coordination of Black's pieces.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Nd4+** (f3d4): Knight check, forcing the king to move or block with the rook.
2. **Rg2+**: Not possible, as the rook is on g8.
3. **Rg1**: Not possible.
4. **Bishop moves**: e.g., Bg4, but doesn't seem to threaten much.
5. **Bishop h3**: e6h3, threatening mate on f1, but White can defend.
6. **Nd2**: f3d2+, check, but White can block with the rook.
7. **Nf3g1**: Not a check, but attacks the rook.
8. **Nf3h2**: Not a check, but attacks the rook.

**Let's calculate the most forcing moves:**

- **f3d4+**: 
    - If Kd2, then Nf3xg1, attacking the rook and threatening mate ideas.
    - If Ke3, then Nf3xg1+ forks king and rook.
    - If Kf1, then Bh3+ is mate.
    - If Kd1, then Nf3xg1, again forking.
    - If Rb1, then Nf3xg1, again forking.

- **f3d2+**:
    - If Kxd2, then Nf3xg1, forking king and rook.
    - If Rxd2, then Nxd2, White loses the rook.

- **e6g4**: Threatens mate on f1, but White can defend with Rb1.

- **e6h3**: Threatens mate on f1, but White can defend with Rb1.

- **h4g3**: Not threatening much.

**Best Move:**
The most forcing move is **f3d4+**, as it gives a check and forces the White king to move, and after that, Black can continue the attack or win material.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f3d4
```

2025-06-22 12:49:50,514 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.64s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black: King on h7, rook on a8 and g8, bishop on e6 and h4, knight on b3 and d4, pawns on a5, b7, e5, d3, g7, h6.
- White: King on d1, rook on b2, pawn on h6, a5, d3.

**Material:**
- Black is up a piece (two bishops, two knights vs one rook).
- White has a dangerous passed pawn on h6, but Black's pieces are very active and White's king is exposed.

**Threats:**
- White threatens to promote h6, but Black controls h8 and can blockade.
- Black has strong threats against White's king, especially with the bishop on h4 and knight on d4.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...g8g1+ (not legal, no rook on g1)
2. ...d4c6 (knight to c6, attacking b4, but not forcing)
3. ...b3c5 (knight to c5, attacking d3)
4. ...h4g5 (bishop to g5, threatening mate ideas)
5. ...d4f3 (knight to f3, check, but not legal as White king is on d1)
6. ...h4e1+ (bishop to e1, check, but White can block with rook)
7. ...d4e2+ (knight to e2, check, king must move to e1)
8. ...d4c2 (knight to c2, check, king must move to c1)
9. ...d4b5 (knight to b5, not forcing)
10. ...e6g4 (bishop to g4, threatening mate ideas)

**Critical checks:**
- ...d4e2+ forces the king to e1.
- ...d4c2+ forces the king to c1.

Let's calculate ...d4e2+:

1. ...d4e2+ 2. Ke1 (only move)
   - Now, ...h4g5 threatens ...g1+ and mate ideas, but White can defend with Rxe2.
   - Alternatively, ...b3c1+ is a fork, but after Kf2, Black can take the rook.

But let's check ...d4c2+:

1. ...d4c2+ 2. Kc1 (only move)
   - Now, ...b3d4 attacks the rook, but White can defend.
   - Alternatively, ...b3a1+ 3. Kb1, but no follow-up.

What about ...h4g5:

- Threatens ...g1+ and mate, but White can defend with Rg2.

What about ...e6g4:

- Threatens ...g1+ and mate, but White can defend with Rg2.

What about ...d4b5:

- Not forcing.

What about ...e5e4:

- Not forcing.

What about ...g8g8 (waiting move):

- Not useful.

What about ...d4e2+ 2. Ke1 b3c1 3. Kf2 (only move) b3d3+ 4. Kf1 (only move) Bh3+ 5. Kg1 Nf3+ 6. Kh1 Rg1#

This is a forced mate sequence!

Let's check:

1. ...d4e2+ 2. Ke1 b3c1 3. Kf2 b3d3+ 4. Kf1 Bh3+ 5. Kg1 Nf3+ 6. Kh1 Rg1#

This is a forced mate in 6.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d4e2
```

2025-06-22 12:49:59,304 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.50s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position breakdown:**
- Black: King on h7, Rooks on a8 and g8, Bishop on e6 and h4, Knight on b3 and e2, pawns on a7, b7, f7, g7, e5.
- White: King on d1, Rook on b1, pawn on d3, h6, a5.

**Material:**
- Black is up a full piece (two bishops, two knights vs one rook and a pawn).
- White's king is exposed on d1.
- White's h6 pawn is advanced, but not immediately threatening.
- Black's pieces are very active, especially the knights and bishops.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens ...Nc3+ (forking king and rook).
- White's rook on b1 is somewhat passive.
- White's king is in danger of being mated or losing material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b3c1+** (Nb3-c1+): Knight check, king must move, then ...Nc3+ forks king and rook.
2. **e2c3+** (Ne2-c3+): Knight check, king must move, then ...Nxb1 wins the rook.
3. **e2c1+** (Ne2-c1+): Knight check, king must move, then ...Nc3+.
4. **h4g3** (Bishop takes on g3): Not immediately threatening.
5. **e6g4** (Bishop to g4): Not immediately threatening.

Let's calculate **b3c1+**:
- 1...Nc1+ 2. Kxc1 (forced) Nc3+ 3. Kc2 Nxb1 (winning the rook). This is a clean win of material.

Let's check **e2c3+**:
- 1...Nc3+ 2. Kc2 Nxb1 (again, winning the rook).

But after **b3c1+**, if White plays Kc2, then after Nc3+ Kc1, Nxb1, Black wins the rook.

But **e2c3+** is more direct, as the king cannot escape the fork.

**Final calculation:**
- 1...Nc3+ 2. Kc2 Nxb1 (Black wins the rook, and White's king is still exposed).

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e2c3
```

2025-06-22 12:50:08,731 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.53s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r5r1/pp3ppk/4b2P/P3p3/7b/1nnP4/2K5/1R6 b - - 14 42

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8, g8; Bishop on e6, Bishop on h4; Knights on b3, c3; Pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g7, h7; King on h7
- White: King on c2; Pawn on d3, h6, a5; Rook on b1

**Positional factors:**
- Black has a massive material advantage (two rooks, two bishops, two knights vs. a rook and a few pawns).
- White's king is exposed on c2.
- Black's pieces are very active and coordinate well.
- White's only hope is the advanced h6 pawn, but it is not immediately threatening.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can consider mating nets or winning more material.
- The White king is vulnerable on c2, and Black's knights and bishops can coordinate for a decisive attack.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b3d4+** (Nb3-d4+): Knight check, forcing the king to move.
2. **c3d5+** (Nc3-d5+): Another knight check, but d4 is more forcing.
3. **h4g5** (Bh4-g5): Attacking the a5 pawn, but not urgent.
4. **e6g4** (Be6-g4): Attacking the rook, but not decisive.
5. **e6c4** (Be6-c4): Attacking the king, but not check.
6. **e6d5** (Be6-d5): Centralizing, but not a check.
7. **c3e2+** (Nc3-e2+): Knight check, but king can escape to d1.

**Calculating b3d4+:**
- 1...Nb3-d4+ 2. Kc2-d1 (only move)
- Now, Black can play Nf3, Bf2, or Rd8, but let's see if there is a forced mate or decisive gain.

**Calculating c3d5+:**
- 1...Nc3-d5 2. Kc2-d1 (only move)
- Similar situation.

**Calculating b3c5:**
- 1...Nb3-c5 2. Kc2-d1 (only move)

**Calculating e6c4:**
- 1...Be6-c4 2. d3xc4 (if White captures), but then Black can play Nxa5, but that's not decisive.

**Calculating h4g5:**
- 1...Bh4-g5 2. Rxb7 (White grabs a pawn, but not dangerous).

**Calculating e5e4:**
- 1...e5-e4 2. d3xe4, not decisive.

**Best move:**
- The check with the knight on d4 is the most forcing. After 1...Nb3-d4+ 2. Kc2-d1, Black can continue with Bg4+ or Nxa5, but the king is driven to the edge and Black's pieces are swarming.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b3d4

2025-06-22 12:50:14,979 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.06s):
Let's analyze the position step by step:

**Position Overview:**
- Black: King on h7, Rooks on a8 and g8, Bishop on e6 and h4, Knights on d4 and c3, pawns on a5, b7, f7, e5, d3, h6.
- White: King on c1, Rook on b1, Pawn on h6, a5, d3.

**Material:**
- Black is up a full piece (2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights vs 2 rooks, 1 bishop, 1 knight).
- White's king is exposed on c1.
- Black's pieces are extremely active and coordinated.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens ...Nde2+ (forking king and rook).
- White's only hope is the h6 pawn, but it's not immediately dangerous.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. ...Nde2+ (d4e2): Forks king and rook, wins material.
2. ...Nxb1 (c3b1): Captures rook, but after Kxb1, White's king is still exposed.
3. ...Bg5 (e6g5): Attacks h6 pawn, but not urgent.
4. ...Nxb5 (c3b5): Captures pawn, but not as forcing.

**Calculation:**
- After ...Nde2+ (d4e2), White must play Kd1 (the only legal move).
- Then ...Nc3+ (c3d1) is check, and after Kc2, ...Nxb1 wins the rook.
- Alternatively, after ...Nde2+, if Kd2, ...Bg5+ is crushing.

**Best Move:**
- ...Nde2+ is a forcing move that wins material and exposes the White king even more.

**Final Move:**
```
d4e2
```

2025-06-22 12:50:24,062 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.70s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8 and g8, bishop on e6, knight on c3, bishop on h4, pawns on a5, b7, e5, d3, f7, g7, h7, king on h7.
- White: Rook on b1, king on c2, pawn on h6, a5, d3.

**Immediate threats:**
- The pawn on h6 is close to queening, but currently blocked by Black's king on h7.
- Black's pieces are very active, especially the bishops and knight.
- White's king is exposed on c2, and Black has a lot of attacking potential.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e2f4**: Knight attacks the bishop on h4 and threatens to fork the king and rook with Ne2-d4+.
2. **e6g4**: Bishop attacks the rook on b1 and keeps pressure.
3. **e6a2**: Bishop check, forcing the king to move.
4. **c3d5**: Knight centralizes, but not as forcing.
5. **h4g5**: Bishop moves, but not threatening.
6. **e6b3+**: Bishop check, king must move.

**Critical lines:**
- **e6a2+**: If K moves to c1, then Ne2-c3+ is a fork. If K moves to d1, then Nc3xb1 wins the rook.
- **e6b3+**: If K moves to d2, then Nc3xb1 wins the rook.
- **e2f4**: Attacks the bishop, but White can respond with Rxb7.

**Calculation:**
- **e6a2+**: 
    - 1... Ba2+ 2. Kc1 (if Kd1, then Nc3xb1 wins the rook)
        - Now, Nc3xb1 is possible, but let's check if there's something better.
    - 1... Ba2+ 2. Kd1 Nc3xb1 3. Kc2 (only move) and Black is up a rook.

- **e6b3+**:
    - 1... Bb3+ 2. Kd2 Nc3xb1+ 3. Rxb1 (forced) Bxb1, Black wins the exchange.

- **e2f4**: 
    - 1... Nf4 2. Rxb7 (threatening mate on g7) Nxh5 3. Rxf7+ Kxh6, Black is safe.

**Best move:**
- **e6a2+** is the most forcing, as it wins the rook after Kd1 Nc3xb1.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e6a2
```

**Position Overview:**
- Black: King on h7, Rook on a8, Rook on g8, Bishop on a2 and h4, Knight on e2 and c3, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g7.
- White: King on c2, Rook on b1, Pawn on a5, d4, h6.

**Material:**
- Black is up a piece and has a very strong position.
- White's king is exposed, and the h6 pawn is advanced but not immediately threatening.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens ...Nxd4+ or ...Nxb1, both forking or capturing material.
- White's only real threat is the h6 pawn, but it is not immediately dangerous.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. ...Nxd4+ (Check, wins the rook on b1 after K moves)
2. ...Nxb1 (Captures rook, but less forcing than check)
3. ...Bxb1 (Also captures rook, but knight is more valuable)
4. ...Rac8 (Brings rook into play, but less urgent)
5. ...Rg2+ (Not possible, no rook on g2)

**Calculation:**
- 1. ...Nxd4+ K moves (c1 or d3), then ...Nxb1 or ...Bxb1, Black wins a rook and keeps the attack.
- 1. ...Nxd4+ K moves, ...Nxb1, Black is up a full rook and knight for nothing.

**Check for Tactics:**
- After ...Nxd4+ K moves, White has no checks or threats.
- No immediate counterplay for White.

**Conclusion:**
- ...Nxd4+ is the strongest move, winning material with check and keeping the initiative.

My move:
```
c3d4
```

2025-06-22 12:50:45,254 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 3.45s):
Thank you for the correction and the list of legal moves.

Let's reassess the position:

- Black's knight on c3 cannot move to d4, so that is not an option.
- The White king is on c2, rook on b1, pawn on a5, d4, h6.
- Black's knight on e2, bishop on a2, bishop on h4, rook on a8 and g8, king on h7, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g7.

**Key observations:**
- The knight on e2 attacks c1 and d4.
- The bishop on a2 attacks b1.
- The bishop on h4 is very active.
- White's king is exposed on c2.
- Black can play ...Nxd4+ if the knight could move there, but it's not legal.
- Black can play ...Bxb1, capturing the rook.
- Black can play ...Nxb1, capturing the rook.
- Black can play ...Bxb1, but then White can recapture with the rook.
- Black can play ...Nxd4+, but that's not legal.

**Best move:**
- Capturing the rook on b1 seems best. Between ...Nxb1 and ...Bxb1, the knight is less valuable than the bishop, so ...Nxb1 is preferable.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c3b1
```

2025-06-22 12:50:54,891 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.55s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move:**
- Black to move.
- Material: Black is up a piece (2 bishops + knight vs 1 bishop + knight), and has two advanced passed pawns (a2 and h6).
- White's king is on d1, somewhat exposed.
- Black's a2 pawn is one step from queening, but currently blocked by White's king on d1.
- Black's h6 pawn is advanced, but not immediately queening.
- White's h6 pawn is a major threat if it can promote, but Black's bishop on h4 controls h8.
- Black's pieces are very active, especially the bishop on a2 and knight on b1.
- White's bishop is passive on d4.

**Immediate threats and candidate moves:**
- The a2 pawn is dangerous, but can't promote immediately.
- The bishop on h4 is very active, threatening multiple checks and attacks.
- The knight on e2 is threatening forks and attacks.
- The White king is on d1, so checks and mating nets should be considered.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e2c3+** (knight check): Forces the king to move, possibly to c1 or e1.
2. **h4g5** (bishop move): Threatens to support the a2 pawn, but no immediate threat.
3. **a2e6** (bishop move): Attacks the d4 bishop, but not forcing.
4. **e2d4** (knight captures bishop): Removes White's only active piece, but gives up the knight for a bishop, and White's king can approach the a2 pawn.
5. **a2b3** (bishop move): Not threatening much.
6. **b1c3+** (knight check): Forces the king to move, but after Kc1, not much follow-up.

**Analysis of e2c3+ (knight check):**
- If Kc1, then a2a1=Q is possible, but White can play Kb2 and attack the queen.
- If Kc2, then a2a1=Q is possible, but White can play Kb2.
- If Ke1, then a2a1=Q, and after Kf2, the queen is safe.

But after e2c3+, Kc1, a2a1=Q, Kb2, Black has a queen and two bishops vs White's bishop and knight, and should be winning.

**Analysis of e2d4 (knight takes bishop):**
- After exd4, White's king can approach the a2 pawn, and Black loses the knight for a bishop. Not optimal.

**Analysis of a2e6 (bishop move):**
- Not forcing, White can ignore.

**Analysis of h4g5 (bishop move):**
- Not forcing.

**Analysis of b1c3+ (knight check):**
- Kc1, then a2a1=Q, Kb2, similar to above.

**Conclusion:**
The most forcing move is **e2c3+**. After this, Black can promote the a2 pawn, and White cannot stop the new queen. Black will have a decisive material advantage.

**Final move:**
```
e2c3
```

2025-06-22 12:51:01,489 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.69s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black: King on h7, rook on a8 and g8, bishop on a2 and h4, knight on b1 and c3, pawns on a7, b7, e5, f7, g7, h6.
- White: King on c1, pawn on d4, h6, a5.

**Material:**
- Black is up a full rook and a minor piece.
- White has a dangerous passed pawn on h6, but it's currently blockaded.

**Threats:**
- White's h6 pawn is one square from queening, but Black's king is blocking it.
- White's king is on c1, far from the action and exposed to back-rank threats.
- Black has a massive material advantage and can press for a win, but must be careful not to allow any counterplay with the h6 pawn.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. ...g8h8: Move the rook to h8, reinforcing the blockade of the h6 pawn.
2. ...h4g5: Move the bishop to g5, attacking the d2 square and possibly preparing to attack the h6 pawn.
3. ...c3e2+: Knight check, but the king can escape to d2.
4. ...a2e6: Move the bishop to e6, attacking the d4 pawn.
5. ...b1a3+: Knight check, but the king can move to d2.
6. ...e5d4: Capture the d4 pawn, but then White can play Kd2.

**Critical Analysis:**
- The most urgent threat is the h6 pawn. If Black ever allows White to play dxe5 and then h7, the pawn could queen.
- The king on c1 is exposed to back-rank threats, so keeping the rooks active is important.
- ...g8h8 is a solid move, as it keeps the h-file under control and prevents any ideas of h7.

**Tactical Check:**
- Is there a forced mate or a way to win more material? Not immediately, but Black's material advantage is overwhelming.

**Best Move:**
- The move ...g8h8 is the most cautious and effective, as it completely nullifies White's only real threat (the h6 pawn) and allows Black to proceed with converting the material advantage.

**Final Move:**
```
g8h8
```

2025-06-22 12:51:09,126 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.28s):
Let's analyze the position step by step:

**Material:**
- Black: Rooks on a8 and h8, knight on b1 and c3, bishop on a2 and h4, pawn on a7, b7, e5, f7, h7
- White: King on c1, pawn on d4, a5, g7

**King safety:**
- White's king is on c1, somewhat exposed.
- Black's king is not on the board (so it's Black to move, and White's king is the only one left).

**Threats:**
- White's g7 pawn is one square from queening, but Black's h8 rook and h7 pawn can control the g8 square.
- Black has a powerful bishop on h4, and two knights deep in White's territory.
- Black's a2 bishop is also dangerous, and the a-file is open.

**Candidate moves:**
- h8g8: Rook to g8, directly stopping pawn promotion.
- h7g8: Pawn captures on g8, but that's not possible as there's no piece on g8.
- h8f8, h8e8, etc.: Rook moves along the back rank.
- h4g5: Bishop moves, but doesn't seem urgent.
- c3d5: Knight moves, but doesn't address the g7 threat.
- a2e6: Bishop moves, but doesn't address the g7 threat.

**Critical issue:** White threatens to promote g7-g8=Q next move. If Black does not stop this, White will queen.

**Best move:**
- h8g8: This move directly stops the pawn from queening, as the rook will capture any pawn promotion on g8.

**Check for tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate or a way to win material? Not immediately, but Black must stop the pawn.

**Conclusion:** The only move to stop White's immediate threat is:

```
h8g8
```

2025-06-22 12:51:15,644 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.48s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r5r1/pp3pPk/P7/4p3/3P3b/2n5/b7/1nK5 b - - 0 49

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Rook (g8), Bishop (h4), Bishop (a2), Knight (c3), Knight (b1), pawns (b7, f7, e5)
- White: King (c1), Pawn (a6), Pawn (d4), Pawn (g7)

**White's threats:**
- The g7 pawn is one square from queening, but Black controls g8.
- White's king is on c1, not very active.
- White's a6 pawn is advanced but blockaded by Black's a7 pawn.

**Black's advantages:**
- Material advantage (two rooks, two bishops, two knights vs. king and pawns).
- White's king is cut off and vulnerable.
- White's g7 pawn is dangerous but can be blockaded.
- Black has a passed b-pawn.

**Immediate tactics:**
- The g7 pawn is one move from queening, but Black can play ...g8g7 to capture it.
- Black can also consider ...g8h8 to keep the rook on the back rank and maintain control.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8g7**: Captures the dangerous g7 pawn immediately.
2. **g8h8**: Keeps the rook on the back rank, but doesn't address the g7 pawn.
3. **h4g5**: Moves the bishop, but doesn't address the g7 pawn.
4. **a2e6**: Moves the bishop, but doesn't address the g7 pawn.
5. **c3e2+**: Knight check, but White's king can move to d1 or b1.

**Critical analysis:**
- If Black plays ...g8g7, White loses the dangerous pawn, and Black is completely winning.
- If Black does not capture the g7 pawn, White will play g8=Q or g8=R, which could create counterplay.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the g7 pawn immediately and remove any counterplay.

**Final move:**
```
g8g7
```

2025-06-22 12:51:21,595 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.33s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Knight (b1, c3), Bishop (a2, h4), Pawns (b7, e5, h7), King (g7), Rook (f7)
- White: King (c2), Pawn (a6, d4)

**White's king is exposed on c2. Black has a dangerous bishop on h4, knights on b1 and c3, and a rook on a8. White's a6 pawn is advanced but not immediately threatening. Black's pieces are very active and coordinate well.**

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop h4-e1+**: This is a check, forcing the White king to move. Let's see where the king can go:
   - K moves to b3 or c1.
   - If Kb3, then ...Nd2+ is a fork.
   - If Kc1, then ...Ne2+ is a fork.
   - This looks very promising.

2. **Bishop h4-f2**: Also a check, but the king can escape to d3 or b3.

3. **Rook a8-c8**: Threatens to invade, but not as forcing as a check.

4. **Knight b1-a3+**: Check, but White can play Kd3.

**Let's calculate 1. ... Be1+ in detail:**
- 50... Be1+
  - 51. Kb3 (if Kd1, then ...Ne2 forks king and rook)
    - 51... Nd2+ (forks king and rook)
      - 52. Kc2 (forced)
        - 52... exd4 (threatening d3+)
        - White is losing material and under heavy attack.

  - 51. Kc1
    - 51... Ne2+ (forks king and rook)
      - 52. Kd1 (only move)
        - 52... Nxg1 (winning the rook)
        - Black is completely winning.

**Conclusion:** 50... Be1+ is a crushing move, winning material and keeping the initiative.

2025-06-22 12:51:28,188 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Knight (b1, c3), Bishop (a2, e1), Pawns (a7, b7, e5, f7, h7), King (g7)
- White: King (d3), Pawn (a6, d4)

**White's king is exposed on d3. Black has a dangerous passed pawn on b7 and a2, and a bishop on a2 attacking d5. Black's pieces are very active, and White's king is in a mating net.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can deliver checkmate with ...e4# if the White king is on d3 and the pawn on d4 is gone.
- Black can also consider ...e5xd4+ to open lines.
- The bishop on a2 is cutting off the c4 and b3 escape squares.
- The knight on c3 is controlling e2 and d1.
- The rook on a8 can swing to the h-file for a back-rank mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...e5xd4 (captures the pawn, opens lines, gives check)
2. ...e1b4 (threatens mate on d4)
3. ...b1d2+ (check, but White can capture)
4. ...a2e6 (centralizes the bishop)
5. ...a8h8 (rook lift, but slow)
6. ...b7b6 (prepares b6-b5, but slow)

**Let's calculate ...e5xd4+:**
- 1... e5xd4+ 2. Kxd4 (forced)
- Now, what next? The king is on d4, and Black can play ...Nb5+ or ...Rd8+.
- 2... Nb5+ 3. Kc4 (or Ke3)
- 3... Rc8+ 4. Kb4 (forced)
- 4... Rc4+ 5. Kxb5 (forced)
- 5... Rb4+ 6. Kxb4 (forced)
- 6... Bc3+ 7. Kc4 (forced)
- 7... Bxc4#

But after 1... exd4+ 2. Kxd4, Black can play ...Nb5+ and White's king is in a mating net.

**Let's check for immediate mate:**
- 1... exd4+ 2. Kxd4 Nb5+ 3. Kc4 Rc8+ 4. Kb4 Rc4+ 5. Kxb5 Rb4+ 6. Kxb4 Bc3+ 7. Kc4 Bxc4#

This is a forced mate in 7.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e5d4
```

2025-06-22 12:51:34,464 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.60s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Knight (b1, c3), Bishop (a2, e1), Pawn (b7, d4, f7, h7), King (g7)
- White: King (c2), Pawn (a6)

**White's threats:**
- The a6 pawn is very close to queening, but currently blocked by Black's bishop on a2.
- White's king is on c2, not very active.
- No immediate threats, but the a6 pawn is a long-term concern.

**Black's plan:**
- Black is up a lot of material (two bishops, two knights, rook, and pawns vs. just a king and pawn).
- The main concern is the a6 pawn. If White manages to support it, it could queen.
- Black should aim to eliminate the a6 pawn or blockade it, while avoiding stalemate tricks.
- Black can also try to checkmate White's king, which is somewhat boxed in.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a2e6** (Bishop moves to e6, attacking the a6 pawn and controlling the queening square)
2. **b1a3+** (Knight check, but White can move king to d1 or b2)
3. **c3e2+** (Knight check, but White can move king to b3 or d1)
4. **f7f6** (Pawn move, not urgent)
5. **d4d3+** (Pawn check, but White can take with king)
6. **a8c8** (Rook swing, but not urgent)
7. **b7a6** (Pawn move, but a6 is occupied)
8. **e1h4** (Bishop move, not urgent)

**Deep analysis:**
- **a2e6**: This move attacks the a6 pawn directly. If White tries to defend with Kd3, Black can play Nc5+ and then take the pawn. If White ignores, Black will capture the pawn next move.
- **b1a3+**: After Kd1, not much progress.
- **c3e2+**: After Kb3, White's king is more active.
- **d4d3+**: After Kxd3, White's king is more active, and Black loses a pawn.

**Conclusion:**
- **a2e6** is the most precise move, attacking the a6 pawn, controlling the queening square, and making progress toward eliminating White's only hope.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
a2e6
```

- Black can threaten mate or win more material.
- The bishop on e1 controls the c3 square, so the White king can't escape via c2 or d2.
- The knight on b1 attacks c3 and d2.
- The rook on f7 can swing to c7 or c8 to cut off the king.
- The bishop on e6 can attack a2 or c4, but more importantly, it can help in mating nets.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d3-d2+**: Check with the pawn, forcing the king to b1 or d1.
2. **Rc8**: Cut off the king from the c-file.
3. **Na2+**: Check, but king can go to d1.
4. **Bf5**: Not threatening anything immediate.
5. **Nd2+**: Check, but king can go to d1.

Let’s analyze **d3-d2+**:
- If 1...d2+ 2.Kd1 (only move), then 2...Bb3# is mate (bishop on e6, pawn on d2, rook on a8, knight on b1 all cover escape squares).

Let’s check for any defense:
- After 1...d2+ 2.Kd1 Bb3# is unstoppable.

**Conclusion:** The move 1...d2+ leads to forced mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d4d2
```

2025-06-22 12:51:48,989 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.82s):
Thank you for your patience and for pointing out the error. Let's carefully re-examine the position and the provided legal moves.

**Position Recap:**
- Black to move.
- White King: c1
- Black pieces: Rooks (a8, f7), Knights (b1, c3), Bishops (e1, e6), Pawns (b7, d4, h7), King (g7)
- White pawn: a6

**Legal moves:**
a8h8, a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8, h7h8, h7g8, h7h6, h7g6, g7g8, g7g6, g7g5, g7g4, g7g3, g7g2, g7g1, e6c8, e6d7, e6f5, e6d5, e6g4, e6c4, e6h3, e6b3, e6a2, c3d5, c3b5, c3e4, c3a4, c3e2, c3a2, c3d1, e1h4, e1g3, e1f2, e1d2, b1a3, b1d2, b7a6, f7f6, b7b6, d4d3, f7f5, b7b5

**Analysis:**

- White's king is on c1, and cannot move to b1, b2, c2, or d2 due to Black's pieces.
- Black has a knight on b1, which covers a3 and d2.
- The bishop on e1 covers c3.
- The knight on c3 covers a2, b5, d5, e2, and a4.
- The bishop on e6 can go to c8, d7, f5, d5, g4, c4, h3, b3, a2.
- The rook on a8 can swing along the 8th rank.

**Immediate threats:**
- The king on c1 is almost mated.
- If the bishop moves to d2 (e1d2), that is check, and the only move for White is Kxd2, but then Nc3-e4+ picks up the king.
- Let's check e1d2:

1. e1d2+ Kxd2 (forced)
2. Nc3-e4+ (forks king and bishop, but king can go to d3 or e2)
But after Kd3, Black can continue to press.

Alternatively, what about c3d1+?
1. c3d1+ Kxd1 (forced)
2. e1b3+ (check), but king can go to e1.

Alternatively, what about e6b3+?
1. e6b3+ Kb1 (only move)
2. Nc3a4 (threatening mate on c3), but White can play a7.

Alternatively, what about a8c8?
1. a8c8, threatening mate on c1.

But let's check for a forced mate.

**Best move search:**

- e1d2+ looks promising.
- c3d1+ also looks promising.

Let’s check e1d2+ in detail:
1. e1d2+ Kxd2 (forced)
2. Nc3e4+ (king must move)
   - Kd3: then Nf2+ forks king and rook, but not mate.
   - Ke1: then Nf2, but not mate.

Alternatively, c3d1+:
1. c3d1+ Kxd1 (forced)
2. e1b3+ (king must go to e1)
3. b3e6 (no check), so not mate.

Alternatively, e6b3+:
1. e6b3+ Kb1 (only move)
2. Nc3a4 (threatening mate on c3)
   - White plays a7, but then Nc3c3 is mate.

Let’s check:
1. e6b3+ Kb1
2. Nc3a4 (threatening Nc3c3#)
   - White plays a7, but Nc3c3# is mate.

**Therefore, e6b3+ is a forced mate in two.**

So the best move is:
```
e6b3
```

2025-06-22 12:51:55,206 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.68s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

FEN: r7/pP3prk/8/8/3p4/1bn5/8/1nK1b3 b - - 0 54

Material:
- Black: Rook (a8), Knight (b1), Bishop (c3), Bishop (e1), Rook (f7), Pawn (d4), King (h7)
- White: King (c1), Pawn (b7)

White's pawn on b7 is one step from queening, but Black's bishop on c3 covers b2, and the rook on a8 covers b8. White's king is stuck on c1, and Black's pieces dominate the board.

Immediate threats:
- White's pawn on b7 is dangerous, but currently blockaded.
- Black has a huge material advantage and can press for a win.

Candidate moves:
1. ...Rb8: Attacks the pawn on b7 directly.
2. ...d3: Pushes the passed pawn, threatening d2 and d1=Q.
3. ...Rf8: Brings the rook to the f-file, but less direct.
4. ...Bb2+: Check, but White just moves the king to d1.
5. ...Na3+: Check, but White just moves the king to d1.

Let's check ...d3:
- If 1...d3, White can't stop d2 and d1=Q easily. If 2. exd3, Black can play Rxb7, winning the pawn.

Let's check ...Rb8:
- 1...Rb8 threatens to capture b7. If 2. Rxb1, then Rxb1+ Kxb1 d3, and Black will queen.

But White doesn't have a rook, so that's not possible.

Let's check ...d3:
- 1...d3, if 2. exd3, then Rxb7, and Black wins the pawn and the game.

Is there any immediate mate or tactic?
- No forced mate, but ...d3 is very strong.

Let's check for any tactics for White:
- White has no checks, and no way to promote the pawn.

Therefore, the best move is to push the passed pawn:

```
d4d3
```

2025-06-22 12:52:00,846 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.94s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** R7/p4prk/8/8/8/1bnp4/8/1nK1b3 b - - 0 55

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (b3, e1), Knight (b1, c3), Pawn (a7), King (g7), Pawn (f7), Rook (g7)
- White: King (c1)

**White's king is on c1, boxed in by Black's pieces. Black has overwhelming material and positional advantage.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can checkmate if the White king is trapped and a check can be delivered.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rook moves: None deliver check.
- Bishop moves: None deliver check.
- Knight moves: c3-d1 is a check.
- Pawn moves: Not relevant for immediate tactics.

**Checkmate threats:**
- Move c3d1 is a check. Let's see if it's mate:
    - After Nc3-d1+, White's only legal move is Kxd1 (since the king is on c1, and the knight is attacking d1).
    - But b1 covers d2 and a3, e1 covers d2, b3 covers c2, and the rook on a8 covers the a-file.
    - Wait, but after Nc3-d1+, the king cannot move to b1 (occupied by knight), d2 (covered by bishop and knight), c2 (covered by bishop), b2 (not available), so is it mate?

Let me visualize:
- c1: White king
- d1: attacked by knight
- b1: occupied by Black knight
- c2: attacked by bishop
- d2: attacked by bishop and knight
- b2: not available

So after Nc3-d1+, the king has no legal moves and nothing can block or capture the knight.

**Therefore, Nc3d1 is checkmate.**

So the best move is:
```
c3d1
```

2025-06-22 12:52:06,584 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.02s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4R3/p4prk/8/8/8/1b1p4/8/1cKnb3 b - - 2 56

- Black to move.
- White's king is on c1, rook on e8.
- Black's king is on h7, rook on g7, bishop on b3, knight on b1, bishop on e1, knight on d1, pawn on d3, pawn on a7.

**Material:**
- Black is up a lot of material: two bishops, two knights, rook, and two pawns vs. White's rook.
- White's king is on c1, boxed in by Black's pieces.
- Black's pieces are dominating the board, and White's rook is far from the action.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can checkmate or win more material with precise play.

**Candidate moves:**
- d1e3+ (knight check): White king has only b1 or d2.
- d1c3+ (knight check): White king has only b2 or d1.
- e1d2+ (bishop check): White king has only b1 or d1.
- e1c3+ (bishop check): White king has only b1 or d1.
- b1c3+ (knight check): White king has only b1 or d1.
- b3a2+ (bishop check): White king has only d1.
- b3c2+ (bishop check): White king has only d1.

Let's check the most forcing move: **d1e3+** (knight to e3, check).

- If Kb1, then Bc2# is mate.
- If Kd2, then Nc4# is mate.

Let's verify:

1. ... d1e3+
   - 2. Kb1 Bc2# (bishop on c2, king on b1, no escape)
   - 2. Kd2 Nc4# (knight on c4, king on d2, no escape)

Both lines are checkmate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d1e3
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/p4prk/8/8/4R3/1b1pn3/8/1K1b3 b - - 4 57

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (g7), Knight (b1, e3), Bishop (b3, e1), Pawn (a7, d3), King (h7)
- White: King (b1), Rook (e4)

**White's king is on b1, quite boxed in. Black has a dangerous passed pawn on d3, and two minor pieces (knight and bishop) near the white king. Black's bishop on e1 covers the a5-e1 diagonal, and the knight on b1 restricts the white king's movement.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can try to promote the d-pawn.
- White's rook is active, but not threatening immediate checks or captures.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d3d2**: Pushes the pawn, threatening to promote. White's rook cannot stop the pawn directly, and the king is cut off.
2. **e3d1+**: Check, but the white king can move to a2 or c1.
3. **e3c4**: Attacks the rook, but the rook can move.
4. **b3c2+**: Check, but the king can move to a2 or c1.
5. **f7f6**: Prepares to defend the bishop, but not urgent.
6. **a7a6**: Not urgent.

**Let's calculate d3d2:**
- 1... d3d2
- 2. Rd4 (only way to stop d1=Q) 
- 2... Bc2+ (forces the king to a2 or c1)
- 3. Ka2 (if Kxc2, then d1=Q)
- Now, Black can play Nb3, threatening mate on a1.

But let's check if White has any defense after 1...d3d2.

**After 1...d3d2:**
- If 2. Rd4, then Bc2+ as above.
- If 2. Rxe3, then d1=Q, and Black wins.

**Is there any way for White to stop the pawn?**
- No, the rook cannot get behind the pawn, and the king is too far.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
d3d2
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (g7), Bishop (b3, e1), Knight (b1, e3), Pawn (a7, d2, f7, h7), King (h7)
- White: Rook (e4), King (b2)

**Threats:**
- White's rook on e4 is active, but White's king is far from the action.
- Black's pawn on d2 is one square from promotion.
- Black's knight on e3 is very powerful, controlling key squares.
- Black's bishop on b3 and knight on b1 are also well placed.
- Black can promote the d2 pawn immediately.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d2d1q (promote to queen)
2. d2d1r (promote to rook)
3. d2d1b (promote to bishop)
4. d2d1n (promote to knight)

Promoting to a queen is the most natural. Let's check for any tactics:

- After d2d1q, White can play Re1, but Black can simply exchange or move the queen.
- There are no immediate checks or threats from White.
- Black will have a decisive material advantage.

**Other moves:**
- e3f5, e3d5, etc., are not as strong as promoting.
- No need to move the king or rook.

**Conclusion:**
Promoting the pawn to a queen is the most decisive move, giving Black a winning advantage.

My move:

d2d1q

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/p4prk/8/8/7R/1b2n3/1K6/1n1qb3 b - - 1 59

**Black to move. Legal moves:** h7g8, h7g6, e1h4, d1h5

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (d1), Rook (f7), Bishop (b3), Knight (b1, e3), King (g7), Pawn (a7)
- White: King (b2), Rook (h4)

**White threats:**
- White's rook on h4 is active, but White is down massive material and has no immediate threats.

**Black's options:**
1. **h7g8**: King to safety, but not necessary as there is no check.
2. **h7g6**: King to g6, also not necessary.
3. **e1h4**: Queen captures rook on h4, winning more material.
4. **d1h5**: Queen to h5, possibly threatening mate, but not as direct as capturing the rook.

**Analysis:**
- **e1h4**: This move captures the only remaining White piece besides the king, leaving White with a bare king. After this, Black will have overwhelming material and can force mate easily.
- **d1h5**: This move puts the queen on h5, but does not threaten anything immediate, and leaves the rook on h4.
- **h7g8 / h7g6**: King moves are unnecessary.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the rook with the queen.

```

2025-06-22 12:52:42,652 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.57s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (d4), Bishop (b3, h4, e3), Pawn (a7), Rook (f7), King (h7)
- White: King (b1)

**White's king is on b1, boxed in by Black's pieces and pawns. Black has overwhelming material and positional advantage.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's queen on d4 controls many squares.
- Black's bishop on b3 controls the a2 and c2 squares, further restricting the White king.
- The bishop on h4 is also cutting off escape squares.
- Black's rook on f7 can swing to the second rank if needed.

**Checkmate threats:**
- Let's look for forced mate or a way to restrict the White king further.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qd1+**: Immediate check. White's only move is Kb2, then Qc2# is mate.
2. **Qd2**: Threatens mate on b2, but not a check.
3. **Bishop moves**: No immediate threats.
4. **Rook moves**: Not as forcing as queen checks.

**Let's calculate Qd1+:**
- 1... Qd1+ 2. Kb2 Qc2+ (only move) 3. Ka1 (forced) Qc1# (mate)

But after 1... Qd1+, White's only legal move is Ka2 (since b2 is covered by the bishop on b3), but let's check:

- 1... Qd1+ 2. Ka2 (only move) Qc2+ 3. Ka1 (only move) Qc1# (mate)

**This is a forced mate in 3.**

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d4d1
```

2025-06-22 12:52:48,560 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.47s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/p4prk/8/8/7b/1b2n3/1K6/3q4 b - - 2 62

- Black is completely winning: up a queen, two rooks, two bishops, and a pawn, with White only having a lone king.
- The White king is on b2, and Black's queen is on d1. Black's bishops are on b3 and h4. Black's knight is on e3. Black's rook is on f7 and g7. Black pawns on a7 and h7.

**Immediate threats/checkmates:**
- Let's look for forced mate. The White king is on b2, and the queen on d1 can move to d2, which would be mate if not for the c2 square.
- The bishop on b3 covers c2, so the king cannot escape there.
- The queen on d1 can play Qc2#, which is checkmate, but c2 is not available because the king is on b2.
- Let's check if Qc2 is possible: No, because the king is on b2.
- What about Qd2+? King cannot move to a3 (blocked by bishop on b3), cannot move to b1 (blocked by queen), cannot move to c1 (blocked by queen), cannot move to a2 (blocked by bishop on b3), cannot move to c2 (blocked by bishop on b3). But the king is on b2, so Qd2+ is not mate, but let's check.

Alternatively, let's look for a forced mate:

- Qc2+ is not possible.
- Qd2+ is possible. After Kb1, then Qc2# is mate because the king cannot escape.

So, the sequence is:
1. Qd2+ Kb1
2. Qc2#

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d1d2
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (d2), Bishop (h4), Knight (e3), Rook (f7), Pawn (a7), King (h7)
- White: King (a3), Bishop (b3)

**White's king is on a3, boxed in by its own bishop on b3 and Black's pieces. Black's queen on d2 controls a lot of squares. The bishop on h4 is menacing, and the knight on e3 is very powerful, controlling c2, d1, f1, g2, g4, d5, c4, and f5. Black's rook is on f7, and pawn on a7.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can checkmate in one move with Qb4# (d2b4), as the White king on a3 has no escape squares and cannot capture the queen because it's protected by the bishop on h4.

Let's verify:
- d2b4: Queen moves to b4, delivering check. The king on a3 cannot move to a4 (blocked by its own bishop), cannot move to b2 (controlled by the queen), cannot move to a2 (controlled by the queen), cannot capture the queen (protected by bishop on h4). No piece can block or capture the queen.

**Conclusion:** Qb4# is checkmate.

My move:
```
d2b4

2025-06-22 12:52:58,369 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.57s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, rook on f7, queen on b4, bishop on b3 and h4, knight on e3, pawns on a7.
- White: King on b2.

**Material:** Black is up a rook, queen, two bishops, and a knight for just a king. White has no pieces or pawns left.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens mate in several ways, as the White king is on b2 with no escape squares except a3 and c3, both controlled by Black's queen and bishop.
- The queen on b4 controls the b-file and fourth rank.
- The bishop on b3 covers a2, c2, and d1.
- The bishop on h4 controls f2, g3, and g5.
- The knight on e3 controls c4, d5, f5, g4, g2, and f1.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- Checkmate is possible if the Black queen moves to a3 or c3, but both squares are currently occupied or not directly accessible.
- The move b4c3 is legal and delivers check. Let's see if it's mate:
    - After Qc3+, the only legal move for White is Kb1 (as a3 is covered by the queen and bishop, and c1 is covered by the bishop).
    - After Kb1, Qc2# is mate, as the king cannot escape.

**Calculation:**
1. b4c3+ Kb1
2. b4c2#

**No other move delivers mate as quickly.**

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b4c3
```

2025-06-22 12:53:04,661 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.17s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (c3), Bishop (h4), Knight (e3), Rook (g7), Pawn (a7), Pawn (f7), King (h7)
- White: King (a3), Bishop (b3)

**King Safety:**
- White's king is on a3, very exposed.
- Black's king is on h7, safe.
- Black's queen, bishop, and knight are very active and coordinate well.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens mate with Qa1# if the bishop on b3 moves.
- Black's knight on e3 covers c4 and d1, and the queen on c3 covers a1 and b2.
- The bishop on h4 controls the long diagonal and can swing to f6 or g5 for mating nets.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qxb3+**: Captures the bishop, but after axb3, the king is still on the a-file and can be mated with Qa1# if the pawn is not there.
2. **Qa1+**: Not possible since the bishop is on b3.
3. **Be7**: Threatens mate on a3, but not immediate.
4. **Nc2+**: Forks king and bishop, but after Bxc2, not decisive.
5. **Qe1**: Threatens mate on a1, but not immediate.

**Best Move Search:**
- **Qxb3+**: If axb3, then Nc2# is checkmate (the king on a3 is boxed in by its own pawn and Black's pieces).

Let's check this:
1. Qxb3+ axb3 Nc2#

This is a forced mate in two.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c3b3
```

Thank you for pointing out the oversight. Let's carefully re-examine the position and the legal moves.

**Position Recap:**
- White King: a3
- White Bishop: b3
- Black Queen: c3
- Black Bishop: h4
- Black Knight: e3
- Black Rook: g7
- Black Pawns: a7, f7

**Critical Analysis:**
- The White king is on a3, and the Black queen is on c3.
- The move c3a1 is legal and is checkmate, as the White king on a3 cannot escape and is blocked by its own bishop and the edge of the board.

**Final Move:**
```
c3a1

- h4e1 (Bishop attacks)
- h4f2 (Bishop attacks)
- f7f6 (pawn move, not urgent)
- a7a5 (pawn move, not urgent)

Let's check the most forcing moves: checks.

1. **a1a3+**: Queen checks on a3. White king must move.
   - Only legal move is Kxa3 (since b4, c2, and b2 are covered by queen/knight).
   - After Kxa3, Black can play Nc2+ (e3c2), which is a fork and wins the king (illegal, as king can't be captured, but this is a mate).
   - Let's check: After a1a3+ Kxa3, e3c2+ is check, and the king has no escape squares (b3, a3, a2, b2, c2 all covered). That is checkmate.

**Conclusion:** a1a3+ is a forced mate in 2.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
a1a3
```

2025-06-22 12:53:23,046 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.98s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on a3, rook on f7, bishop on h4, knight on e3, pawn on a7
- White: King on a3

**Position:**
- White's king is on a3, boxed in by Black's pieces and pawn.
- Black has a rook, bishop, knight, and pawn, all coordinated.
- White has no pieces left.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can try to checkmate the White king.
- The king is on a3, so the only escape squares are b4 and b2, but both are covered by Black's pieces.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rook moves: f7f6, f7f5, etc. (not immediately threatening)
- Bishop moves: h4d8, h4e7, h4f6, h4g5, h4g3, h4f2, h4e1 (bishop can cut off escape squares)
- Knight moves: e3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1 (knight can deliver check or cut off squares)
- Pawn moves: a7a6, a7a5 (not immediately threatening)
- Rook moves: g7g8, g7g6, etc. (not immediately threatening)

**Checkmate ideas:**
- The White king is on a3. If we can cover b4 and b2, and deliver a check on a3, it's mate.
- The bishop on h4 can move to e7, f6, or g5 to cut off the b4 square.
- The knight can move to c4, which covers b2 and b4.

**Best move:**
- Knight to c4 (e3c4) covers both b2 and b4, trapping the White king on a3. Next move, Black can play bishop to e7 or rook to f3/f4 and deliver mate.

Let's check if there is an immediate mate:
- After e3c4, White has no moves (stalemate?).
- But it's Black's move, so after e3c4, White's king has no legal moves, and it's not in check. That would be stalemate, which is not what we want.

Let's try another move:
- Bishop to e7 (h4e7) covers b4, but b2 is still available.
- Rook to f3 (f7f3) covers b3, but not b2 or b4.
- Rook to f4 (f7f4) covers b4, but not b2.

What about rook to f1 (f7f1)? No, that's not legal.

What about bishop to f2 (h4f2)? That covers b2, but not b4.

What about rook to f2 (f7f2)? Not legal.

What about bishop to g3 (h4g3)? That covers b4, but not b2.

What about knight to c2 (e3c2)? That covers b4, but not b2.

What about rook to f6 (f7f6)? Not immediately threatening.

What about bishop to e1 (h4e1)? Not helpful.

What about bishop to f6 (h4f6)? That covers b2, but not b4.

What about bishop to d8 (h4d8)? That covers b6, not helpful.

What about rook to f4 (f7f4)? That covers b4.

So, the best move is to avoid stalemate and keep pressing.

**Best move:** Move the bishop to f6 (h4f6), which covers b2 and keeps the king boxed in, but does not stalemate.

```
h4f6

2025-06-22 12:53:28,516 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.20s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, rook on g7, bishop on f6, knight on e3, pawn on a7
- White: King on b4

**Material:** Black is up a rook, bishop, knight, and pawn vs just a king. This is a trivially won endgame for Black, but must avoid stalemate.

**Immediate threats:** None from White. Black can play for mate or force the White king to the edge.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f6e7**: Bishop pulls back, but doesn't threaten mate.
2. **g7g4**: Rook cuts off more space, but not forcing.
3. **e3d5**: Knight centralizes, but not forcing.
4. **f6e5**: Bishop controls more squares.
5. **g7g6**: Rook keeps king cut off.
6. **a7a5**: Pawn push, but not urgent.

**Best plan:** Use the rook to cut the king, coordinate with bishop and knight, and avoid stalemate.

**Check for mate:** Is there a forced mate? Not yet, but we can restrict the king.

**Best move:** Rook to g4. This cuts off the king from the fourth rank, and the king cannot approach the rook. The king is forced to the a-file, and Black can bring the bishop and knight closer.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-22 12:53:33,779 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.16s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, Bishop on f6, Knight on e3, Rook on g4, Pawn on a7
- White: King on b3

**Material:**
- Black is up a rook, bishop, knight, and pawn vs just a king.

**Threats:**
- Black has overwhelming material and can checkmate soon.
- The White king is on b3, with no escape squares on the a-file or c-file.
- The Black rook on g4 can swing to the b-file for a check.
- The Black bishop and knight control key squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Rg4-b4+ (forces the king to a3 or c3)
2. Rg4-g3+ (forces the king to a2 or b2)
3. Bishop moves (but no immediate threats)
4. Knight moves (but no immediate threats)
5. Pawn moves (not urgent)
6. King moves (not urgent)

**Checkmate ideas:**
- The king is cut off from the a-file and c-file, so a rook check on b4 is very strong.

**Calculate Rg4b4+:**
- 1...Rg4b4+ 2. Ka3 (only move)
- Now, 2...Nc2# is checkmate (the knight on e3 covers c2 and a1, rook covers b4, bishop covers b2, king covers a4).

**Conclusion:**
- Rg4b4+ leads to forced mate in one.

**Best move:**
```
g4b4
```

2025-06-22 12:53:41,310 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.65s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King (h7), Bishop (f6), Knight (e3), Pawn (a7)
- White: King (b4)

**Position:**  
- Black is up a bishop, knight, and pawn vs. lone king.
- The Black king is on h7, far from the action, but White's king is also far from the pawn.
- Black's a7 pawn is ready to advance.
- Black's bishop and knight are centralized and can control key squares.

**Goal:**  
- Convert to a win by promoting the a-pawn or checkmating the White king.
- Avoid stalemate or perpetual check.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. a7-a6 or a7-a5: Advance the pawn, but White's king is close enough to try to blockade.
2. e3-d5: Knight centralization, controls c3 and b4.
3. f6-e7: Bishop repositioning, but not urgent.
4. f6-b2: Bishop attacks a1, but not necessary.
5. f6-d8: Bishop covers a5, but not needed.
6. e3-c4: Knight attacks b2 and a3, but White's king is on b4.
7. f6-e5: Bishop controls c3 and d4.

**Best Plan:**  
- Use the bishop and knight to restrict the White king, then advance the pawn.
- The White king is on b4, so if we play a5, White can play Kxa5 after a4, so we need to restrict the king first.

**Key Tactic:**  
- If we play e3-d5, the knight covers b4 and c3, so the White king cannot approach the pawn.
- Then, we can play a7-a5 and a5-a4, and White's king cannot approach.

**Calculation:**  
1. e3-d5 (knight to d5, covers b4 and c3)
2. If White does nothing, a7-a5, then a5-a4, and pawn promotes.

**Check for stalemate:**  
- White king still has moves after Nd5.

**Final Move:**  
The best move is to play the knight to d5, restricting the White king.

2025-06-22 12:53:48,862 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.44s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, Bishop on f6, Knight on d5, Pawn on a7
- White: King on a5

**Material:** Black is up a bishop and knight, with a pawn on a7. White only has a king.

**Objective:** Checkmate the lone White king, avoid stalemate, and press the advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
- The White king is on a5, so it can only move to a6, b5, or b4 (but b4 is covered by the knight).
- Black's king is far, but the bishop and knight can coordinate to restrict the White king.
- Advancing the a-pawn (a7a6) is possible, but let's check if it's best now.
- Moving the bishop or knight to restrict the White king further.
- King moves are possible, but not urgent.

**Key considerations:**
- Avoid stalemate (if the White king is boxed in with no moves, but not in check, it's a draw).
- Keep the White king restricted, and coordinate bishop and knight for mate or to force the king to the edge/corner.

**Move analysis:**
- a7a6: Advances the pawn, but doesn't restrict the White king further. White can play Ka6, and the pawn is not ready to queen.
- d5b4: Knight to b4 checks the king, but after Kb5, the king is still mobile.
- f6d8: Bishop to d8, covers b6 and c7, but doesn't restrict the king much.
- f6g7: Bishop to g7, covers b2, but not relevant.
- f6e7: Bishop to e7, covers b4, but knight already does.
- d5c7: Knight to c7, covers b5 and a6, but not b4.
- d5e3: Knight to e3, not relevant.
- f6d4: Bishop to d4, covers b6 and c5, but not urgent.

**Best move:**
- Let's try to restrict the White king further. If we play d5b4+ (knight to b4 check), the White king must go to b5 (only legal move). Then, we can coordinate bishop and knight to drive the king to the edge and eventually mate.
- Alternatively, we can play f6d8, preparing to cover b6 and c7, but it's slower.

**Conclusion:**
- d5b4+ is the most forcing move, checking the king and pushing it further to the edge.

**Final move:**
```
d5b4

2025-06-22 12:53:55,950 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.71s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Material: Black is up a piece (bishop and knight vs. White's lone king).
- White's king is on b5, Black's king on h7, bishop on f6, knight on b4, pawn on a7.
- Black's knight on b4 controls key squares around the White king.
- Black's bishop on f6 is very powerful, controlling the long diagonal.
- Black's king is far away, but White has no pawns and no way to create threats.
- Black's plan: Use the bishop and knight to restrict the White king, then bring the king closer and eventually checkmate.

Short-term tactics:
- The White king is on b5, and the knight on b4 is controlling a lot of escape squares.
- The bishop can move to a1, b2, c3, d4, e5, g5, h4, d8, h8, g7, e7.
- The knight can move to c6, a6, d5, d3, c2, a2.
- Black can also push the a-pawn.

Candidate moves:
1. b4c6+ (knight check): White king must move to a6 or a4.
2. f6d4 (bishop move): Controls more squares, but not a check.
3. a7a6 (pawn push): No immediate threat, but prepares to advance the pawn.
4. f6b2 (bishop move): Controls b2, but not a check.
5. f6a1 (bishop move): Not useful.
6. b4a6 (knight move): Not a check, but covers c7 and b8.

Let's check b4c6+:
- If b4c6+, White king must go to a6 or a4.
- If Ka6, then Black can play Bc3, controlling b4 and a5, further restricting the king.
- If Ka4, then Black can play Bc3, controlling b4 and a5 as well.

This seems like a good way to restrict the White king further.

Let's check f6d4:
- Not a check, but controls c5 and b6.
- White king can move to a6 or a4, but not as forcing as the knight check.

Let's check a7a6:
- Not urgent, as White has no threats.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b4c6
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/p4p1k/2n2b2/8/K7/8/8/8 b - - 6 73

**Black:** King on h7, Bishop on f6, Knight on c6, Pawn on a7, Pawn on f7  
**White:** King on a4

**Move history:**  
White's king has been shuffling on the queenside, and Black's minor pieces are centralized. Black is up a bishop and a knight, with two pawns vs. just a king for White. This is a textbook win, but care must be taken to avoid stalemate.

**Immediate plan:**  
- The White king is on the edge (a4).  
- Black should avoid stalemating the king and methodically bring the king closer or use the minor pieces to restrict the White king's movement.
- Advancing the a-pawn is possible, but let's make sure the White king is not stalemated.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c6d4** (Knight to d4): Controls b3 and c2, further restricting the White king.
2. **f6e7** (Bishop to e7): Prepares to shepherd the king.
3. **h7g6** (King to g6): Starts bringing the king closer.
4. **a7a6** (Pawn to a6): Prepares to advance the pawn, but not urgent.

**Stalemate check:**  
If we play c6d4, White's king still has a5 and b3 squares. No stalemate.

**Best move:**  
Let's play **c6d4**, further restricting the White king and preparing to bring our king closer or advance the pawn with support.

2025-06-22 12:54:11,379 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.38s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (h7), Bishop (f6), Knight (d4), Pawn (a7)
- White: King (b4)

**White's king is far from the action, and Black has a bishop, knight, and pawn. The pawn is ready to advance.**

**Immediate threats:**
- No immediate threats from White; White's king is too far to attack anything.
- Black can consider advancing the pawn, centralizing the king, or repositioning the bishop/knight.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a7a6** (advance the pawn): Start pushing the pawn, but White's king is close enough to potentially stop it.
2. **f6e7** (bishop retreat): Not necessary.
3. **d4e6** (knight reposition): Could bring the knight closer to support the pawn.
4. **f6g7** (bishop move): Not necessary.
5. **h7g6** (king move): Centralize the king, but not urgent.
6. **d4c6** (knight retreat): Not necessary.
7. **d4b5** (knight move): Could support pawn push.
8. **d4b3** (knight move): Could threaten checks or support pawn.

**Key strategic idea:** 
- The pawn is not passed, but White's king is close. Black should coordinate bishop and knight to support pawn promotion, while keeping the White king cut off.

**Best plan:** 
- Use the knight to support the pawn, or to cut off the White king.
- a7a5 is possible, but White's king can approach.
- d4b5 is interesting: attacks the a7 pawn's square, and if White's king approaches, the knight can support the pawn.

**Calculation:**
- 1...d4b5 2.Ka5 (attacking the pawn) a7a6 3.Kxa6 (White wins pawn)
- 1...a7a5 2.Ka5 (attacking the pawn) Nc6+ 3.Ka4 (if 3.Kb5, then Nd4+ and a4 pawn is safe)
- 1...d4e6 2.Ka5 a7a6 3.Kxa6 Nc5+ 4.Kb5 (White is close to the pawn)

**But what about king moves?**
- 1...h7g6 or h7h6: King is too far to help.

**What about bishop moves?**
- 1...f6g7: Not useful.
- 1...f6e7: Not useful.

**What about knight moves to c2 or e2?**
- 1...d4c2 2.Ka5 a7a6 3.Kxa6 Nb4+ 4.Kb5 (White is close)

**What about d4b3?**
- 1...d4b3 2.Ka4 Nc5+ 3.Kb5 (White is close)

**What about d4f5?**
- 1...d4f5 2.Ka5 a7a6 3.Kxa6 (White wins pawn)

**What about d4e2?**
- 1...d4e2 2.Ka5 a7a6 3.Kxa6 (White wins pawn)

**What about d4f3?**
- 1...d4f3 2.Ka5 a7a6 3.Kxa6 (White wins pawn)

**What about a7a5?**
- 1...a7a5 2.Ka5 Nc6+ 3.Ka4 (if 3.Kb5, then Nd4+ and a4 pawn is safe)

Let's check this line:
1...a7a5 2.Ka5 Nc6+ 3.Ka4 (if 3.Kb5, then Nd4+ and a4 pawn is safe)
Now, 3...Bd8 (threatening Be7, trapping the king), but White can escape.

Alternatively, after 1...a7a5 2.Ka5 Nc6+ 3.Ka4, Black can play 3...Be7, and the king is stuck on a4.

**Summary:** The move 1...a7a5 seems to be the best, as it keeps the pawn and allows the knight to support it with tempo.

**Final move:**
```
a7a5
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on h7, Bishop on f6, Pawn on a5, Pawn on f7
- White: King on d4

**Position:**
- Black is up a bishop and a pawn.
- White's king is active, but Black's pieces are well-coordinated.
- Black's bishop controls many squares, and the king is safe.
- Black's a-pawn is a passed pawn and can be pushed.
- White's king is far from the kingside and the a-pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a5a4: Push the passed pawn. White's king is too far to stop it.
2. f6d8: Bishop retreat, but not necessary.
3. f6g7: Bishop stays active.
4. h7h8: King move, but doesn't change much.

**Critical calculation:**
- If a5a4, White cannot stop the pawn from queening without sacrificing the king's activity.
- White's king is too far to stop the a-pawn, and Black's bishop can control the queening square if needed.

**Short-term tactic:** Push the a-pawn.
**Long-term strategy:** Promote the pawn and win with overwhelming material.

**Best move:**
```
a5a4
```

2025-06-22 12:54:22,625 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.89s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5p1k/5b2/3K4/p2n4/8/8/8 b - - 1 76

**Black:** King on h7, Bishop on f6, Knight on d4, Pawn on a4, Pawn on f7  
**White:** King on d5

**Legal moves:**  
h7h8, h7g8, h7g7, h7h6, h7g6, f6h8, f6d8, f6g7, f6e7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4, d4e6, d4c6, d4f5, d4b5, d4f3, d4b3, d4e2, d4c2, a4a3

**Position assessment:**
- Black is completely winning: up a bishop and knight, with a pawn on a4 and f7, White has only a king.
- The only thing to watch for is stalemate or accidental repetition.
- The White king is on d5, and Black's pieces are well placed to restrict it.
- The immediate goal is to avoid stalemate, keep the White king boxed in, and coordinate the pieces for a checkmate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4e6+**: Knight check. White king must move. Let's see where it can go:
   - d5e4, d5d6, d5c4, d5c6, d5e5 (but e5 is covered by bishop), so only e4, d6, c4, c6.
   - After the check, the White king is forced to move, and Black can continue to restrict it.
2. **f6g7**: Move bishop, but doesn't threaten anything.
3. **f6g5**: Bishop covers more squares, but doesn't force anything.
4. **a4a3**: Push pawn, but not urgent.
5. **d4f5**: Knight move, but doesn't force anything.
6. **f6e5**: Bishop move, but doesn't force anything.

**Best move:**
- **d4e6+** is the most forcing move, checking the king and pushing it further back. There is no risk of stalemate, and it keeps up the pressure.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d4e6
```

2025-06-22 12:54:28,993 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.08s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Black: King on h7, Bishop on f6, Knight on e6, Pawn on a4, Pawn on f7
- White: King on c4

Material: Black is up a bishop and knight, and has two pawns (a4, f7). White has only the king.

Objectives:
- Convert the material advantage to a win.
- Avoid stalemate traps.
- Coordinate pieces to restrict the White king and promote a pawn.

Candidate moves:
1. a4a3: Pushes the pawn, but White can approach and blockade. Not urgent.
2. f6g7: Bring bishop closer to the action, but not necessary yet.
3. e6f8: Knight back, but not effective.
4. f6d8: Bishop to d8, controls c7, b6, but not urgent.
5. f6e5: Bishop to e5, centralizes and restricts White king.
6. f6g5: Bishop to g5, but not effective.
7. f6h4: Bishop to h4, not effective.
8. e6d4: Knight to d4, attacks c2, b3, but White king can attack a4.
9. e6g5: Knight to g5, not effective.
10. e6f4: Knight to f4, attacks e2, d3, but not urgent.

Best plan: Centralize pieces, restrict White king, and prepare to promote a pawn. The White king is on c4, so let's restrict its movement and prepare to support the a-pawn.

The move 1...B(e5) is strong: it centralizes the bishop, restricts the White king, and supports the a-pawn's advance.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f6e5

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, Knight on e6, Bishop on e5, Pawn on a4, Pawn on f7
- White: King on d3

**Material:** Black is up a piece and a pawn. White has only the king.

**Objective:** Convert the material advantage to a win, avoiding stalemate and maximizing efficiency.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a4-a3**: Pushes the passed pawn, but White's king is close enough to approach.
2. **f7-f6/f7-f5**: Prepares to create another passed pawn, but not urgent.
3. **King moves (h7h8, h7g8, etc.)**: Not urgent; king is safe.
4. **Bishop moves**: Could reposition, but currently well-placed.
5. **Knight moves**: Could reposition to support pawn advance or restrict White's king.

**Key consideration:** Avoid stalemate, keep White's king restricted, and push the a-pawn with support.

**Best plan:** Advance the a-pawn, but ensure the king and pieces are coordinated to support promotion and avoid stalemate.

**Check for tactics:** Is there any immediate way to force White's king away or set up a mating net? Not yet, but advancing the a-pawn is the most direct plan.

**Move:**

2025-06-22 12:54:40,493 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.39s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, pawn on a3 and f7, knight on e6, bishop on e5
- White: King on e4

**Material:**
- Black is up a piece and has two pawns, one of which (a3) is very advanced.
- White has only the king.

**Threats and Plans:**
- Black's a3 pawn is two squares from promotion.
- The White king is too far to stop the a-pawn.
- Black's pieces (knight and bishop) control key squares.
- The only thing to watch for is stalemate or accidental perpetual.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **a3-a2**: Pushes the pawn, threatening to promote next move. White cannot stop it.
2. **f7-f6/f5**: Not urgent, pawn is not under threat.
3. **King moves**: Not urgent, king is safe.
4. **Piece moves**: No immediate threats, but could reposition for mate net.

**Risks:**
- Stalemate: If White's king is boxed in and Black promotes without care, could stalemate.
- But currently, White's king has many squares.

**Best Move:**
- **a3-a2** is the most direct and forces promotion next move. After a2, White cannot stop a1=Q. Black can then coordinate pieces for a swift mate.

**Final Move:**
```
a3a2

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (h7), Knight (e6), Bishop (e5), Pawn (a2), Pawn (f7)
- White: King (f5)

**Position:**
- Black's a2 pawn is one step from promotion.
- White's king is active but cannot stop the a-pawn.
- Black's pieces are centralized and control key squares.
- No immediate threats from White.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a2a1Q**: Promote the pawn to a queen. This is the most forcing move, as it gains a decisive material advantage. After promotion, Black will have a queen, bishop, and knight against a lone king.
2. **a2a1N/B/R**: Underpromotions are not necessary here; queen is best.
3. Other moves (bishop/knight moves, king moves, pawn moves) do not press the advantage as much as immediate promotion.

**Tactics:**
- After a2a1Q, White's king is far from the action and cannot threaten Black's new queen.
- Black can coordinate pieces for a swift checkmate.

**Conclusion:** 
The best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

2025-06-22 12:54:50,486 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.43s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Knight (e6), Bishop (e5), Pawn (f7), King (h7)
- White: King (e4)

**Position:**
- White's king is exposed in the center.
- Black's queen is on a1, knight on e6, bishop on e5, pawn on f7, king on h7.
- White has no pieces except the king.

**Objective:** 
- Deliver checkmate or force a win, avoid stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Checks: 
    - Qd4+ (a1d4): Queen checks, forces the king to move.
    - Qh1+ (a1h1): Queen checks, but king can escape.
    - Qe1+ (a1e1): Queen checks, king can go to f5 or f3.
- Other moves: Improve piece positions, but with White's king so exposed, checks are preferable.

**Check for stalemate:**
- If we check, White must move, so no stalemate.

**Best move:**
- Qd4+ (a1d4): This is a forcing move. The king must move, and it keeps the king in the center, where Black's pieces can coordinate for mate.

**Double-check:**
- After Qd4+, White's only move is Kf5 (Ke3 is covered by the knight, Kf3 is covered by the bishop, Kf5 is the only square).

**Follow-up:**
- After Kf5, Black can continue with Qf4# (if the bishop moves), but let's play Qd4+ first.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
a1d4
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (d4), Knight (e6), Bishop (e5), Pawn (f7), King (h7)
- White: King (f3)

**White's king is exposed and Black has overwhelming material.**
- White has no pawns or pieces, only the king.
- Black's queen, knight, and bishop dominate the board.
- The Black king is safe on h7.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can deliver checkmate or force mate in a few moves.
- The White king is on f3, and Black's queen controls the fourth rank and can cut off escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qf4#**: Queen to f4 is checkmate. The White king on f3 cannot move to e2, e3, e4, f2, g2, g3, or g4—all are covered by Black's queen, bishop, or knight. The king is boxed in.

**Verification:**
- f3-e2: covered by d4
- f3-e3: covered by d4
- f3-e4: covered by d4
- f3-f2: covered by d4
- f3-g2: covered by d4
- f3-g3: covered by d4
- f3-g4: covered by d4
- f3-e5: covered by bishop
- f3-g5: covered by knight

**Conclusion:** Qf4 is checkmate.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (f4), Knight (e6), Bishop (e5), Pawn (f7), King (h7)
- White: King (g2)

**Position:**
- White's king is on g2, with no other pieces.
- Black's queen is on f4, bishop on e5, knight on e6, pawn on f7, king on h7.
- Black is completely winning, but must avoid stalemate.

**Immediate threats:**
- White's king has squares: f2, g1, h1, h2, h3 (but h3 is not accessible).
- Black must avoid stalemating the White king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qh2+** (f4h2): King must go to f1 or g1.
2. **Qf3+** (f4f3): King must go to g1 or h2.
3. **Qh4** (f4h4): Not a check, but restricts king.
4. **Qe4+** (f4e4): King must go to g1 or h2.
5. **Qf5** (f4f5): Not a check, but restricts king.
6. **Bishop moves:** e5g7, e5f6, e5d6, etc.
7. **Knight moves:** e6g5, e6g7, etc.

**Checkmate threats:**
- If the queen moves to h2, it's check, but king can go to f1 or g1.
- If the queen moves to f3, it's check, king can go to g1 or h2.
- If the queen moves to e4, it's check, king can go to g1 or h2.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Let's try Qh2+ (f4h2):
    - Kg1 or Kf1.
    - If Kg1, then Qg3+ forces Kh1, then Qh2# is mate.
    - If Kf1, then Qh1# is mate.

So, Qh2+ looks very strong.

Let's check for stalemate after Qh2+:
- If Kg1, Qg3+ Kh1 Qh2# is mate.
- If Kf1, Qh1# is mate.

Therefore, Qh2+ is the fastest mate.

**Final move:**
```
f4h2

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5p1k/4n3/4b3/8/8/7q/5K2 b - - 7 84

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (h2), Bishop (e5), Knight (e6), Pawn (f7), King (h7)
- White: King (f1)

**White's king is on f1, boxed in by Black's pieces. Black's queen is on h2, bishop on e5, knight on e6, pawn on f7, king on h7.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black is completely winning. White has only the king left.
- The White king is on f1. Let's look for forced mates or ways to restrict the king further.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qh1#**: This is checkmate, as the king on f1 has no escape squares and is not protected by any piece.
2. Other moves are unnecessary, as checkmate is available.

**Verification:**
- King on f1, queen on h2. Qh1 is check. The king cannot move to e1, f2, or g1 (all covered by Black's pieces or occupied).
- No White pieces to block or capture.

**Conclusion:** The best move is checkmate in one.

2025-06-22 12:55:11,992 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.39s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (h1), Knight (e6), Bishop (e5), Pawn (f7), King (h7)
- White: King (e2)

**Position:**
- White's king is on e2, very exposed.
- Black's queen is on h1, controlling the first rank and h-file.
- Black's knight and bishop are centralized.
- Black has a pawn on f7, which can be pushed.
- White has no pieces left.

**Objective:** Deliver checkmate or force a decisive win.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe4+** (h1e4): Queen check, forces the king to move.
2. **Qh5+** (h1h5): Queen check, king can go to e3 or f2.
3. **Qh2+** (h1h2): Queen check, king can go to d3 or f1.
4. **Qh3+** (h1h3): Queen check, king can go to d2 or f2.
5. **Qf3+** (h1f3): Queen check, king can go to e1 or d2.
6. **Qe1+** (h1e1): Queen check, king can go to f3 or d3.
7. **Qd1+** (h1d1): Queen check, king can go to e3 or f2.

But let's look for forced mates or a sequence that leads to mate.

**Check all checks:**
- h1e4 (Qe4+): King can only go to f2 or d2.
  - If Ke2-d2, then Qd4+ is mate (since c3, c1, e1, e3, f3, f1 are all covered).
  - If Ke2-f2, then Qf4+ and then Qf3#.

Let's check h1e4:
- 1... Qe4+ 2. Kd2 Qd4+ 3. Ke2 (forced) Qd1+ 4. Ke3 Qe1# (mate).

Alternatively, after 1... Qe4+ 2. Kf2 Qf4+ 3. Ke2 Qf3+ 4. Ke1 Qf2# (mate).

**Conclusion:** Qe4+ leads to forced mate in a few moves.

**Final move:**
```
h1e4

2025-06-22 12:55:16,901 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.36s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, Knight on e6, Bishop on e5, Queen on e4, Pawn on f7
- White: King on f2

**Material:** Black is up a queen, bishop, and knight vs just a king. This is a trivially won position for Black, but let's ensure there are no stalemate tricks and aim for a swift mate.

**Immediate threats:** 
- White's king is on f2, with no pawns or pieces to help.
- Black's queen, bishop, and knight can coordinate for mate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Queen moves: e4 (central, controls many squares)
- Bishop moves: e5 (controls diagonals, can cut off escape)
- Knight moves: e6 (can jump to many squares to help with mate)
- King moves: h7 (can approach if needed)
- Pawn moves: f7 (can advance if needed)

**Check for immediate mates:**
- Qe4-e2 is mate (since the king is on f2 and all escape squares are covered):
    - e2: Queen moves to e2, king on f2, squares e1, f1, g1, g2, g3, f3, e3 are all covered by Black's pieces.

Let's verify:
- Qe2: King on f2, can't go to e1 (queen), f1 (queen), g1 (queen), g2 (queen), g3 (bishop), f3 (queen), e3 (queen).
- No other pieces to block or capture.

Therefore, the move is:

2025-06-22 12:55:24,579 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.89s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (h7), Knight (e6), Bishop (e5), Queen (e2), Pawn (f7)
- White: King (g1)

**Position:**
- White's king is on g1, with no other pieces.
- Black has a queen on e2, bishop on e5, knight on e6, pawn on f7, king on h7.

**Goal:** 
- Deliver checkmate as soon as possible, with no chance of stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Queen moves: e2-g4, e2-e1, e2-e3, e2-g2, etc.
- Bishop moves: e5-g3, e5-f4, e5-d4, etc.
- Knight moves: e6-f4, e6-g5, etc.

**Checkmate threats:**
- The White king is on g1. Let's look for forced mates.

1. **Queen g4+**: King can only go to f1.
2. **Queen e1+**: King can only go to h2 or f2 (but both are not possible).
3. **Queen e3**: No check.
4. **Bishop h2**: Not possible.
5. **Queen g2**: Not possible.
6. **Queen f3**: Not possible.

**Let's check Qe1+:**
- 1... Qe1+ 
  - If Kg2, then ...Qxg3#.
  - If Kh2, then ...Qxg3#.
  - If Kh1, then ...Qf1#.

But White king is on g1, so after Qe1+, only move is Kh2 or Kg2 (but both are not possible), so only move is Kh1.

But from g1, after Qe1+, only move is Kh2, but h2 is not available. So let's check:

- 1... Qe1+ Kg2 (only legal move)
- 2... Qxg3#

But let's check if Qe1+ is mate:

- 1... Qe1+ Kg2 (forced)
- 2... Qxg3+ Kf1 (only move)
- 3... Qg1#

But after Qe1+, White king can only go to h2 or g2, but both are not available. Let's check the squares around g1:
- h1: not available
- h2: not available
- f1: not available
- f2: not available
- g2: not available

So, after Qe1+, White king has no legal moves. Is this checkmate?

Let's check for stalemate:
- White king on g1, Black queen on e2, bishop on e5, knight on e6, pawn on f7, king on h7.
- After Qe1+, king is in check and cannot move anywhere.

Therefore, **Qe1# is checkmate**.

So, the best move is:
```
e2e1
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, Knight on e6, Bishop on e5, Queen on g3, Pawn on f7
- White: King on f1

**Material:** Black is up a queen, bishop, knight, and pawn vs just a lone king.

**Immediate threats:** 
- Black can checkmate in one move if possible.
- The White king is on f1, and Black's queen is on g3, bishop on e5, knight on e6.

**Candidate moves:**
- Look for forced mate: Queen moves to f3, f2, g1, etc.
- Bishop moves to f4, g3, etc.
- Knight moves to f4, d4, etc.

**Checkmate possibilities:**
- Qg1# is not possible (f1 is occupied by the king).
- Qf3 is not check.
- Qg2 is not check.
- Qg4 is not check.
- Qh3 is not check.
- Qf4 is not check.
- Qg5 is not check.
- Qg6 is not check.
- Qg7 is not check.
- Qg8 is not check.

**Bishop checks:**
- Be5h2 is not possible.
- Be5g3 is not possible.
- Be5f4 is not check.
- Be5d4 is not check.
- Be5c3 is not check.
- Be5b2 is not check.
- Be5a1 is not check.

**Knight checks:**
- Ne6f4 is not check.
- Ne6d4 is not check.
- Ne6g5 is not check.
- Ne6c5 is not check.
- Ne6g7 is not check.
- Ne6c7 is not check.
- Ne6f8 is not check.
- Ne6d8 is not check.

**Queen moves:**
- Qg1 is checkmate! The king on f1 cannot move to e1, e2, f2, g2, or g1 (all covered by Black's pieces).

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-22 12:55:52,826 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.15s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5p1k/4n3/4b3/8/8/4K3/6q1 b - - 19 90

**Black:** King on h7, Knight on e6, Bishop on e5, Pawn on f7, Queen on g1  
**White:** King on e2

**Material:** Black is up a queen, bishop, knight, and pawn versus just the lone white king.

**Objective:** Deliver checkmate as quickly and safely as possible, avoiding stalemate or any unnecessary prolonging.

**Candidate moves:**
- Queen moves: g1g2, g1g3, g1g4, etc.
- Bishop moves: e5f4, e5d4, etc.
- Knight moves: e6f4, e6d4, etc.
- King moves: h7h8, h7g8, etc.
- Pawn moves: f7f6, f7f5

**Immediate tactics:**  
White's king is on e2. Let's see if there is a forced mate or a way to restrict the king further.

**Check options:**  
- g1g2+ (Queen to g2) is check.  
  - If K moves to e3, then Qg3# is mate.
  - If Kd1, then Qg1# is mate.
  - If Kf1, then Qf2# is mate.
  - If Kd3, then Qg3# is mate.

Let's check the move `g1g2`:

1. ... Qg2+  
   - Ke1: Qg1#  
   - Kd1: Qg1#  
   - Kd3: Qg3#  
   - Kd2: Qg1#  
   - Kf1: Qf2#  
   - Ke3: Qg3#  
   - Kd4: Qg4#  
   - Kf3: Qg3#  
   - Kf2: Qf2#  
   - Kd1: Qg1#

But the only legal move for White after Qg2+ is Ke1 (since the king is on e2, and all other squares are covered by Black's pieces). After Ke1, Qg1# is checkmate.

**Therefore, the fastest mate is:**
```
g1g2
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King (h7), Knight (e6), Bishop (e5), Queen (g2), Pawn (f7)
- White: King (e1)

**White is down to just the king. Black has overwhelming material and can checkmate quickly.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- The White king is on e1, with no escape squares.
- Black's queen on g2 controls the second rank and g-file.
- Black's bishop and knight can help deliver mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qg1#**: Queen to g1 is checkmate. The king cannot move to d1, f1, d2, f2, or e2 (all covered by Black's pieces).
2. Any other move would delay the mate.

**Verification:**
- After Qg1, the White king on e1 has no legal moves, and no piece can block or capture the queen.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is the immediate checkmate.

2025-06-22 12:56:03,430 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.27s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, Knight on e6, Bishop on e5, Queen on g1, Pawn on f7
- White: King on e2

**Material:** Black is up a queen, bishop, knight, and pawn vs. just a lone king.

**Immediate threats:** Black can checkmate White with the queen, bishop, and knight. The White king is on e2, and Black's queen is on g1, which can deliver checks along the first rank and diagonals.

**Candidate moves:**
- Queen moves: g1g2 (check), g1e1 (check), g1e3 (check), etc.
- Bishop moves: e5f4 (check), e5d4 (check), etc.
- Knight moves: e6d4 (check), e6f4 (check), etc.

Let's look for forced mate:

1. **g1g2+**: White king must go to e1 or e3.
   - If Ke1, then Qg1+ and repeat.
   - If Ke3, then Qg3+ and repeat.

2. **Bishop checks:**
   - e5f4+ forces the king to f3 or d3.
   - e5d4+ forces the king to d3 or f3.

But let's check for a direct mate:

- **g1e1+**: White king must go to d3 or f3.
   - If Kd3, then Qd1+ and Kc4, but no immediate mate.
   - If Kf3, then Qf1+ and Kg4, again no immediate mate.

- **e5f4**: Not a check, but covers escape squares.

- **e6d4+**: King must go to d3 or f1.
   - If Kd3, then Qd1+ and Kc4, no mate.
   - If Kf1, then Qg1+ and Ke2, repeat.

- **g1g2+**: Let's see the sequence:
   - Ke1: Qg1+ Ke2, repeat.
   - Ke3: Qg3+ Ke2, repeat.

- **g1e3+**: Ke1 or Kd1.
   - Ke1: Qg1+ Ke2, repeat.
   - Kd1: Qd3+ Ke1, Qd1# (Checkmate).

So, **g1e3+** forces the king to d1 (since e1 is mate in two), and then Qd3+ and Qd1# is mate.

Let's check the sequence:
1. ... Qg1e3+
   - If Ke1, then Qg1+ Ke2, repeat.
   - If Kd1, then Qd3+ Ke1, Qd1#.

So, **g1e3+** is the fastest route to mate.

**Final move:**
```
g1e3
```

2025-06-22 12:56:10,218 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.97s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5p1k/4n3/4b3/8/4q3/8/5K2 b - - 25 93

**Material:**
- Black: King on h7, Bishop on e5, Knight on e6, Queen on e3, Pawn on f7
- White: King on f1

**Position:**
- White's king is on f1, boxed in by Black's pieces.
- Black's queen on e3, bishop on e5, and knight on e6 dominate the board.
- Black's king is safe on h7.
- White has no pieces left.

**Objective:** 
- Deliver checkmate or force White into zugzwang.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe1#**: Queen to e1 is checkmate, but the queen is on e3, so that's not possible in one move.
2. **Qf3**: Queen to f3 is mate, but that's not possible in one move.
3. **Qe2+**: Queen to e2 is check, but the king can move to g1.
4. **Qf4**: Queen to f4 is not check.
5. **Qd3**: Queen to d3 is not check.
6. **Qe4**: Queen to e4 is not check.
7. **Qf2**: Queen to f2 is check, but the king can move to g1.
8. **Bishop moves**: None deliver checkmate immediately.
9. **Knight moves**: None deliver checkmate immediately.
10. **Pawn moves**: Not relevant for immediate mate.

**Best move:**
- Let's check if **Qe1** is possible: No, queen is on e3.
- **Qf2+**: King can only go to g1.
- After **Qf2+ Kg1**, then **Qh2#** is mate.

So, the fastest way is to play **Qf2+**.

**Double-check:**
- After **Qf2+**, White's only move is **Kg1**.
- Then **Qh2#** is mate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e3f2

2025-06-22 12:56:15,454 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.31s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, Knight on e6, Bishop on e5, Pawn on f7
- White: King on f2

**Material:** Black has a bishop, knight, and pawn vs. lone king.

**Goal:** Checkmate White as efficiently as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate Considerations:**
- White's king is on f2, with escape squares e2, e3, f3, g2, g3, g1, f1, e1. But many are controlled by Black's pieces.
- Black's king is far, but the bishop and knight can coordinate to restrict the White king.
- No immediate checkmate, but we must avoid stalemate and keep the king boxed in.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **e6d4** (Knight to d4): Controls e2, f3, c2, c6, b5, f5, and b3. Also, restricts the White king further.
2. **e5d4** (Bishop to d4): Controls c3, e3, f2, g1, h8, but less effective than the knight.
3. **e5g3** (Bishop to g3): Controls f2, h2, h4, f4, but not as restrictive.
4. **e6f4** (Knight to f4): Attacks the king, but allows White to escape to e3.
5. **f7f6** (Pawn move): Not urgent, as pawn promotion is not the priority.

**Best Plan:** Use bishop and knight to restrict the king, then bring the king closer for mate. The knight move to d4 is strong, as it cuts off many escape squares and keeps the king boxed.

**Check for stalemate:** After N(d4), White still has moves (Ke3, Kf1, etc.), so no stalemate.

**Final Move:**
```

2025-06-22 12:56:23,030 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.41s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Material: Black is up a bishop and a pawn (bishop on e5, pawn on f7, knight on d4 vs. White king on g2).
- White has only a king, so Black's task is to checkmate.
- The Black king is on h7, so it's not participating yet.
- Black's pieces are centralized and well-placed.
- The White king is on g2, close to the edge.

Immediate threats:
- Black can try to restrict the White king and bring the king closer.
- The knight on d4 controls important squares (f3, f5, e2, c2, b3, b5, c6, e6).
- The bishop on e5 controls the long diagonal and can help cut off escape squares.

Candidate moves:
1. f7f6 or f7f5: Advance the pawn, but not urgent.
2. d4e6: Knight closer to the king, but not immediately useful.
3. e5g3: Bishop to g3, restricts the king.
4. e5f4: Bishop to f4, restricts the king.
5. d4f3: Knight to f3, check, but White king goes to h1.
6. e5h2: Bishop to h2, restricts the king.
7. h7g7: Move the king closer.

Let's check the forcing moves:
- d4f3+ is a check. White must play Kxf3 or Kh1.
  - If Kxf3, then bishop and knight can coordinate for mate.
  - If Kh1, then Black can try to bring the bishop to g3 or f4, and the king to g6, f5, etc.

But after d4f3+, White plays Kxf3, and then Black can play bishop to f4, but White king can escape.

Alternatively, e5g3 restricts the king to the second rank, and then the knight can come to f5 or e2.

But the most forcing move is d4f3+, as it checks the king and forces it to move.

Let's calculate:
1. d4f3+ Kg2xf3
2. e5f4 (cutting off escape squares)
3. White has only Kg2, so Black can bring the king closer.

Alternatively, after d4f3+ Kh1, then bishop to g3 or f4, and the king is trapped in the corner.

But let's check e5g3:
- e5g3 restricts the king to the second rank.
- White's only move is Kg2.
- Then Black can play d4f5, threatening Ne3+ and mate ideas.

But the most forcing is d4f3+.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d4f3
```

2025-06-22 12:56:29,461 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.18s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, Bishop on e5, Knight on f3, Pawn on f7
- White: King on h1

**Material:** Black has a bishop, knight, and pawn vs. lone king. This is a textbook checkmate scenario, but requires precision.

**Goal:** Checkmate the White king, avoid stalemate.

**White's king is trapped on h1.** Only squares available are h1 and g1, but g1 is covered by the knight on f3. The bishop and knight can coordinate to force mate.

**Immediate checks:**
- No immediate checks.

**Avoiding stalemate:** If Black plays f7-f6 or f7-f5, White is not stalemated, as h1 is still available.

**Best plan:** Bring the king closer, but since it's not Black's move, let's look for a forced mate or a way to restrict the White king further.

**Candidate moves:**
- e5g3: Bishop to g3, covering h2 and f2, but not a check.
- f3g5: Knight to g5, covers h3 and f3.
- e5f4: Bishop to f4, covers h2 and g3.
- f7f6: Pawn move, no immediate threat.
- e5h2: Bishop to h2, covers g1, but not a check.

**Critical analysis:**
- e5g3: Bishop on g3, covers h2, but White is not stalemated (can move on h1).
- e5h2: Bishop on h2, covers g1, but again, not stalemate.
- f3g5: Knight to g5, covers h3, but not a check.

**What about e5h2?**
- If bishop goes to h2, White's king is stuck on h1, but not stalemated (still has h1).
- Next, Black can bring the knight to g4, then f2, then h3, and mate with bishop on g3.

**But is there a faster way?**
- Let's try to force the king to the corner and then mate with bishop and knight.

**Best move:** Let's play the bishop to h2, preparing to bring the knight to g4 and then f2 for mate.

**Final move:**
```
e5h2
```

- Black's king is safe.
- Black can consider pushing the f-pawn, but must be careful not to allow White to sacrifice the bishop for the pawn and then draw by insufficient material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. f3-g5 (knight move, attacks h3 and e4, but not much immediate threat)
2. f3-e5 (centralizes knight, attacks bishop on h2)
3. f3-h4 (attacks bishop, but bishop can move)
4. f3-d4 (centralizes knight)
5. f3-d2 (attacks bishop, but bishop can move)
6. f3-g1 (attacks bishop, but bishop can move)
7. f3-e1 (attacks bishop, but bishop can move)
8. h7-h8, h7-g8, h7-g7, h7-h6, h7-g6 (king moves, but no immediate threat)
9. h2-b8, h2-c7, h2-d6, h2-e5, h2-f4, h2-g3, h2-g1 (bishop moves, but it's White's move after Black)
10. f7-f6, f7-f5 (pawn pushes, but must be careful)

**Key idea:**  
If I play f3-e5, I attack the bishop on h2. If the bishop moves, I can start pushing the f-pawn. The knight and king can support the pawn's advance. The bishop is poorly placed and can't easily stop the pawn.

**Check for tactics:**  
- Is there any way for White to sacrifice the bishop for the pawn and draw? Not immediately, as the bishop is far from the f-pawn.
- Is there a forced mate? Not yet, but the knight and pawn can work together.

**Best move:**  
- f3-e5 attacks the bishop, gains tempo, and prepares to push the pawn.

**Final move:**
```
f3e5
```

2025-06-22 12:56:43,547 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.31s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- Black: King on h7, Knight on e5, Bishop on h2, Pawn on f7
- White: King on h1

**Material:** Black is up a bishop and knight, White has only a king.

**Threats:** 
- White's king is stuck in the corner (h1).
- Black's bishop on h2 controls the g1 square, so the White king cannot escape to g1.
- The knight on e5 can move to threaten mate or support a mating net.
- Black's king is safe.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate? Let's check possible knight moves:
    - Nf3: Not possible, as f3 is not a legal move.
    - Ng4: Not a check, but covers f2.
    - Nf3, Ng4, Nf7, etc. None are checks.
- Bishop moves: 
    - h2-g3: Not a check.
    - h2-f4: Not a check.
    - h2-g1: Not a check.

**Plan:** 
- The White king is stuck on h1. If we can control g1 and g2, and bring the knight to f3 or g4, we can force mate.
- The move h2-g3 threatens mate with Nf3# (since the bishop will control h2 and g1, and the knight will cover g1 and h2).

**Candidate moves:**
1. h2g3: Prepares Nf3# mate.
2. e5g4: Prepares Nf2# mate if the bishop moves.
3. f7f6/f7f5: Not urgent, doesn't help the mating net.
4. King moves: Not relevant.

**Check for immediate mate:**
- After h2g3, White has no move (since it's Black's move, and White has only the king). Next move, Nf3# is unstoppable.

**Best move:** h2g3, threatening Nf3# mate.

So, the best move is:
```
h2g3
```

2025-06-22 12:56:50,648 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Material: Black is up a bishop and a pawn (bishop on g3, knight on e5, pawn on f7, king on h7). White has only the king on g1.
- Black's king is safe. White's king is on g1, with no pieces to help.
- Black's bishop on g3 and knight on e5 are well placed to restrict the white king.
- Black's pawn on f7 can be advanced.
- Black's king can approach, but it's already close to the action.

Objective: Checkmate the lone white king as efficiently as possible, avoiding stalemate.

Candidate moves:
1. **e5f3+**: Knight check. White must go to f1 or h1.
2. **g3h2+**: Bishop check. White must go to f1 or h1.
3. **f7f5/f6**: Advance pawn, but not urgent.
4. **King moves**: Not urgent.

Let's check the checks:
- **e5f3+**: If Kf1, then Bh3# is mate. If Kh1, then Bh3 is not mate, but restricts the king.
- **g3h2+**: If Kf1, then Bh3# is mate. If Kh1, then Bh3 is not mate.

Let's check for stalemate:
- After e5f3+, if Kh1, White still has g1 and h1 squares.
- After e5f3+, if Kf1, Bh3# is mate.

Therefore, the fastest forced mate is:
1. **e5f3+** (forces Kf1 or Kh1)
   - If Kf1, Bh3#.
   - If Kh1, Black can continue with Bh3 and then mate with Ng4 or similar.

So, the best move is:
```
e5f3
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

FEN: 8/5p1k/8/8/8/5nb1/8/5K2 b - - 12 100

Black: King on h7, pawns on f7, bishop on g3, knight on f3
White: King on f1

Material: Black is up a bishop, knight, and pawn. White has only the king.

Immediate threats: None from White. Black can try to checkmate or force a win.

Candidate moves:
- g3e1#: Bishop to e1 is checkmate. The White king on f1 cannot move to any square, and no piece can block or capture the bishop.

Let's verify:
- e1 is not attacked by White.
- King on f1 is boxed in by its own position and Black's pieces.
- No escape squares.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g3e1
```
