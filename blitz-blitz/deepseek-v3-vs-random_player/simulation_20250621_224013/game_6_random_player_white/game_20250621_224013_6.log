2025-06-22 00:52:14,129 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.42s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.
1. The position is the standard starting position after White has played Nb1-a3 (a somewhat unusual first move). Black has all standard options available.
2. Key considerations:
   - White's knight on a3 is not particularly threatening yet
   - Black should aim for central control and development
   - We should consider moves that both develop pieces and challenge White's setup
3. Candidate moves worth considering:
   - g8f6 (developing knight to its most natural square)
   - e7e5 (claiming central space)
   - d7d5 (immediate central challenge)
   - b8c6 (developing knight with potential to pressure a3)
4. Evaluating top candidates:
   - g8f6: Solid development, but doesn't immediately challenge White's setup
   - e7e5: Good central control, but leaves f6 knight undeveloped
   - d7d5: Strong central push, but may be premature without development
   - b8c6: Puts immediate pressure on White's knight, forcing it to move or be exchanged
5. The most principled move seems to be b8c6:
   - Develops a piece
   - Challenges White's knight
   - Prepares for possible d7-d5 push
   - Maintains flexibility in pawn structure
6. Other moves like e7e5 or g8f6 are also reasonable, but b8c6 seems most active and challenging to White's unusual knight placement.
After careful consideration, the best move is:
```
b8c6
```

2025-06-22 00:53:17,801 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.46s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Current position analysis:
- White has developed the knight to a3 and played h3, which is a bit unusual
- Black has developed the knight to c6
- Both sides have their other pieces in starting positions
- White's pawn structure is slightly weakened by h3 (potentially creating a target)
2. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8f6: Developing the knight to its most natural square
- e7e5: Claiming space in the center
- d7d5: Another central pawn push
- g7g6: Preparing to fianchetto the bishop
- f7f5: More aggressive but loosens the position
3. Evaluation of best options:
- g8f6 is very solid and develops a piece
- e7e5 is good for central control but allows d2-d4 in response
- d7d5 is more flexible and doesn't immediately allow central counterplay
4. Potential threats:
- White could play d2-d4 next, so we should be ready to meet that
- The knight on a3 is awkwardly placed and not threatening anything yet
5. Best choice:
Developing the knight to f6 is the most principled move, completing development and preparing to castle. It also keeps options open for future pawn breaks in the center.

2025-06-22 00:54:11,541 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.22s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except Black has developed knights while White has developed a knight and pawns)
2. White's structure:
- Knight on a3 is awkwardly placed
- Pawns on g3/h3 create a fianchetto-like structure but bishop isn't developed yet
- White's king is still in the center
3. Black's structure:
- Both knights developed (c6 and f6)
- All pawns remain on 7th rank
- Black has the option to fianchetto either bishop
- Black's king is still in the center
4. Key considerations:
- White's a3 knight is misplaced - we might want to exploit this
- We should develop our dark-squared bishop
- We could consider preparing to castle
- We might want to challenge White's control of the center
Candidate moves worth considering:
1. d7d5 - Directly challenging the center
2. e7e5 - Another central challenge
3. g7g6 - Preparing to fianchetto the bishop
4. d7d6 - More flexible development
After careful consideration:
- d7d5 seems premature as White could play c2c4 or e2e4
- e7e5 is interesting but might allow White to gain space
- g7g6 is solid, preparing Bf8-g7
- d7d6 is flexible, keeping options open
The best move appears to be g7g6, preparing to fianchetto the bishop and potentially castle kingside. This develops our position while maintaining flexibility.

2025-06-22 00:55:10,120 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.67s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except Black hasn't developed the dark-squared bishop yet)
2. White has developed knight to a3 (not the most active square) and played some pawn moves
3. Black has developed knight to c6 and f6, and fianchettoed the bishop with g6
4. White's king is still in the center while Black can castle quickly
5. White's pawn structure is somewhat loose with pawns on c3 and a3
Key considerations:
- Black should complete development and castle
- The f8 bishop needs to find a good square
- We should consider controlling the center
- White's a3 knight is awkwardly placed and could be a target
Candidate moves:
1. f8g7 - Completes fianchetto and prepares to castle
2. e7e5 - Strikes in the center immediately
3. d7d5 - Another central push
4. a8b8 - Prepares to develop the rook via b7
After careful consideration:
- f8g7 is very solid and prepares castling
- e7e5 is more aggressive but leaves d5 weak
- d7d5 is interesting but might be premature
- a8b8 is a bit slow
The most principled move is to complete development with f8g7, preparing to castle next move and maintaining flexibility. This keeps all options open while solidifying our position.
```

2025-06-22 00:55:48,440 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.47s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Current position assessment:
- Black has developed pieces more actively than White (both knights and bishop vs White's knight and pawns)
- Black's king is still in the center but can castle quickly
- White has a space advantage with d4 pawn
- Black's dark-squared bishop is very strong on g7
2. Candidate moves to consider:
- Castling (e8g8): Safest option, gets king to safety
- e7e5: Challenges White's center immediately
- f6g4: Puts pressure on h2 pawn
- c6e5: Centralizes knight and eyes d3 square
3. Evaluating options:
- e8g8 is solid but may be too passive
- e7e5 is tempting but after dxe5 Nxe5, White gets open lines
- f6g4 looks aggressive but after h3 Ng4 hxg4 Bxg4, White's pawn structure is compromised
- c6e5 is interesting but can be met with f3
4. Best choice:
f6g4 seems most promising as it:
- Creates immediate threats
- Puts pressure on White's kingside
- Can lead to favorable exchanges or weaknesses
- Maintains flexibility in our position
The move also fits well with our bishop on g7, which would become very active if the h-pawn is exchanged.

2025-06-22 00:56:31,183 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.83s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except Black has developed more)
2. Black has a well-developed position with the bishop on g7 and knight on g4
3. White's kingside is slightly weakened by g3 and h3
4. White's knight on b1 is awkwardly placed
5. Black has the option to castle queenside or kingside
Candidate moves to consider:
- e8g8 (kingside castling): Safest option, connects rooks and gets king to safety
- g4e3: Immediate tactical threat, attacking the weak f1 square
- c6e5: Centralizing the knight, eyeing d3 and f3 squares
- g4h6: Less promising, retreats the active knight
- h8g8: Prepares castling but leaves king in center
Looking deeper:
- g4e3 looks tempting as it threatens Nxf1 winning the exchange, but after Nxe3 Bxe3, White can play Qd2 defending and Black's initiative fades
- e8g8 is solid but perhaps too passive
- c6e5 is interesting, preparing to jump to d3 or f3 later while maintaining pressure
The most promising seems to be c6e5:
- Centralizes the knight
- Prepares to jump to d3 or f3
- Maintains pressure on White's position
- Doesn't create any weaknesses
- Keeps all options open for Black
After c6e5, possible continuations could be:
- If White plays Nf3, then Nxf3+ and Black gets the bishop pair
- If White doesn't react, Black can consider moves like Qd7 or 0-0-0
Therefore, the best move is:
```
c6e5

2025-06-22 00:57:24,755 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.00s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except Black has developed more actively)
2. Black has a strong knight on e5 and another on g4, putting pressure on White's position
3. White's pawn structure is slightly compromised with pawns on c3 and d4
4. White's king is still in the center while Black's king can potentially castle quickly
5. White's knight on b1 is poorly placed
Key observations:
- The knight on g4 is under attack by f3 pawn
- White has weaknesses on the dark squares (f2, h2)
- Black can consider immediate tactical shots or solid development
Candidate moves to consider:
1. e5f3 - Sacrificing the knight to open up White's king position
   After 2. gxf3 g4xf3 3. Qxf3, Black gets strong play with ...Bg4 or ...Qd5
2. g4h2 - Forking the rook and bishop
   But after 2. Kxh2, Black doesn't get enough compensation
3. e8g8 - Castling to safety while keeping pressure
4. g4f6 - Retreating the knight but this seems passive
The most promising is e5f3, sacrificing the knight to open lines against White's king. After:
1... e5f3 
2. gxf3 g4xf3 
3. Qxf3 Bg4 
4. Qg3 (best) Qd5 with strong pressure on d4 and f2
This leads to a very promising position where Black has excellent compensation for the sacrificed knight with open lines against White's king.

2025-06-22 00:58:14,024 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 20.30s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except White has an extra pawn, but Black has compensation with active pieces)
2. Black's pieces are well-developed:
   - Bishop on g7 is very strong
   - Knight on g4 is putting pressure on White's position
   - King is still in the center but can castle quickly
3. White's position has some weaknesses:
   - The f3 pawn is isolated and could be a target
   - The dark squares around White's king are weak (especially h2)
   - White's king is still in the center
Key observations:
- The knight on g4 is very active but could be kicked by h2-h3
- The bishop on g7 is pointing at White's queenside
- Castling would be good for Black's king safety
- The move g4e3 looks tempting as it forks the queen and pawn on f3
Let me consider the best candidate moves:
1. g4e3 - Forking queen and pawn. But after Qxe3, we lose the knight for a pawn (not good)
2. e8g8 (castling) - Safest option, but maybe too passive
3. g4h2 - Attacking the weak h2 square. After Kxh2, we have Bxc3 with discovered attack on the queen
4. g4f2 - Forking king and rook. But Kxf2 and we don't have enough compensation
5. h8g8 - Preparing to double rooks on the g-file
The most promising seems to be g4h2, sacrificing the knight to weaken White's king position:
1. g4h2 2. Kxh2 Bxc3
Now White's queen is under attack and if 3. bxc3 Qd6+ with a strong attack
Alternatively, if 2. Kh1 instead of Kxh2, we can play 2...Nxf3 with complications
This seems like the most forcing and aggressive continuation, taking advantage of White's weak dark squares around the king.

Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except White is missing a knight)

- We need to create counterplay before White consolidates
- Castling would be dangerous as White's pawn storm is coming
Candidate moves to consider:
1. h8g8 - Rook lift to potentially attack the king
2. e8g8 - Castling
3. h2g4 - Trying to save the knight
4. g7f8 - Protecting the rook to enable castling
After deep consideration:
- h2g4 fails to Kxg4
- Castling (e8g8) is too slow and White can trap the knight then attack
- The best option is to sacrifice the knight and create immediate threats against White's exposed king
The most forcing and dangerous move is h8g8, preparing to bring the rook into the attack with g8g3 next move. White will likely take the knight next move, but we get strong attacking chances against the exposed king.

2025-06-22 01:00:45,370 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 20.18s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns
- Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns
- Material is roughly equal
2. King safety:
- White's king is exposed on e1 with weak pawn cover
- Black's king is still in the center but has some protection
- White's h2 knight is very active and threatening
3. Key features:
- Black's dark-squared bishop is very strong on g7
- White's pawn structure has some weaknesses (isolated d4 pawn)
- Black has potential to open the position with ...d5 or ...f5
4. Immediate threats:
- White's knight on h2 is eyeing f1 and g4 squares
- Black needs to address the knight's activity while developing counterplay
Best candidate moves:
- h2g4: Centralizing the knight and threatening to jump to e3 or f2
- g7h6: Developing the bishop to a more active diagonal
- g8h8: Connecting rooks and getting the king to safety
- d7d5: Challenging White's center
After careful consideration, h2g4 seems most promising:
- It activates the knight to a strong central outpost
- Prepares potential sacrifices on f2 or e3
- Maintains pressure on White's position
- Doesn't allow White any immediate counterplay
The move also prevents White from playing g3-g4 to expand on the kingside. Other moves either don't address the knight's activity or allow White to consolidate.

2025-06-22 01:01:49,652 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 18.33s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)
2. White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h5, but it's not immediately threatening
3. Black's knight on g4 is very active, eyeing potential squares like e3 and f2
4. White's queen on e2 is somewhat exposed
5. Black's king is still in the center but not in immediate danger
6. Black's dark-squared bishop is fianchettoed and controlling important diagonals
Key observations:
- White's king is still uncastled and somewhat exposed
- The h5 pawn could become dangerous if not addressed
- Black has opportunities to create threats against White's position
Candidate moves to consider:
1. g4e3 - Forking queen and pawn, but after Qxe3, Black loses the knight for just a pawn
2. g4f2 - Attacking the queen and rook, but Qxf2 is possible and Black loses material
3. g6h5 - Taking the pawn immediately, but opens the g-file for White's rook
4. g7h6 - Developing the bishop while preventing g5 ideas
5. e8f8 - Getting the king to safety
After careful consideration:
- g6h5 seems too risky as it opens lines for White
- g4e3 and g4f2 lose material
- e8f8 is solid but doesn't create counterplay
- g7h6 is interesting as it prevents White from playing g4 and maintains pressure
The best move appears to be g7h6, which:
- Develops the bishop to a more active square
- Prevents White from playing g4 to dislodge our knight
- Maintains all our pieces' activity
- Doesn't create any weaknesses

2025-06-22 01:02:25,902 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 17.36s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a bishop on h6, pawns on d4, c3, f3, g3, h5, queen on e2, and standard other pieces.
- Black has a rook on g8, bishop on c8, queen on d8, king on e8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g6, and knight on g4.
2. Key observations:
- White's bishop on h6 is very active and pinning the g7 pawn to the king.
- Black's knight on g4 is under attack by the h5 pawn.
- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous.
- Black's king is still in the center, which is concerning.
3. Threats:
- Immediate threat is h5xg6, winning the knight.
- White could also consider pushing h5-h6 to further weaken Black's king position.
4. Candidate moves:
- g4h6: Capturing the bishop, but after Qxh6, Black loses material.
- g4f6: Moves the knight to safety while maintaining pressure.
- g6h5: Capturing the pawn, but opens the g-file dangerously.
- g8g7: Defending the h6 bishop indirectly, but allows h6.
5. Best move analysis:
- g4f6 seems most resilient:
  * Gets the knight to safety
  * Maintains control over e4
  * Doesn't open any lines for White
  * Prepares potential ...Ng4-e5 ideas
- Other moves either lose material or create serious weaknesses.
6. Long-term considerations:
- Need to castle or get the king to safety soon.
- May need to challenge the h6 bishop with ...Bh6 at some point.
- Need to develop the queenside pieces.
After careful consideration, the best move is:
```
g4f6
```

2025-06-22 01:03:24,526 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.64s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Q+R+B vs Q+R+B), but White has a more active position with the bishop on h6 and rook on h4.
2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous. White's king has castled queenside but is somewhat exposed.
3. Immediate threats: White has a discovered attack possibility with the bishop on h6 if the knight moves. The rook on h4 is also eyeing the h7 pawn.
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Safeguards the rook but doesn't improve the position
- g8f8: Connects rooks but still leaves king in center
- f6h5: Attacks the rook but allows Bxh5 winning material
- f6d5: Centralizes the knight but opens up the bishop's diagonal
- e7e6: Improves pawn structure but is passive
- d7d5: Challenges the center but may open lines
5. Best options seem to be:
- f6d5: Centralizing the knight while blocking the bishop's diagonal
- e7e6: Solidifying the center and preparing to develop the dark-squared bishop
After deeper consideration, f6d5 looks most active:
- It blocks the bishop's diagonal to f8
- Controls important central squares
- If White takes dxe5, we can recapture with the pawn
- Keeps options open for future development
The alternatives either don't address the king safety or allow White to maintain pressure. While e7e6 is solid, it's too passive in this critical position.

2025-06-22 01:05:01,146 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.76s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights each, but Black has an extra pawn). However, White's pieces are more active.
2. Key features:
- White has strong pressure on the kingside with the bishop on h6 and rook on h4
- Black's king is exposed on g8
- White's queen on e2 is eyeing the h5 pawn
- Black's knight on d5 is well-placed but potentially vulnerable
3. Threats:
- White threatens to play Qxh5, winning a pawn with a strong attack
- If Black plays gxh5, then Rxh5 is very dangerous with the open h-file
4. Candidate moves to consider:
a) g6h5 - prevents Qxh5 but weakens the pawn structure
b) g8h8 - gets the king to relative safety
c) d5f6 - blocks the bishop's diagonal and defends h5
d) g8g7 - gets the king away from immediate danger
After careful consideration:
- g6h5 is too weakening and gives White a strong initiative
- g8h8 is better but still leaves the king somewhat exposed
- d5f6 seems most principled, blocking the bishop and defending h5
- g8g7 is risky as it walks into potential discovered attacks
The best move appears to be d5f6, which:
- Blocks the bishop's diagonal
- Defends the h5 pawn
- Maintains the knight's central presence
- Doesn't create new weaknesses

2025-06-22 01:06:15,317 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.40s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a knight and pawn vs White's bishop and pawn, but overall balanced)
2. King safety:
- White's king is exposed on e1 with limited pawn cover
- Black's king is still in the center but has some pawn cover
3. Piece activity:
- White has active pieces: rook on h4, bishop on g2, queen on e2
- Black's knight on f6 is under attack by the h5 pawn
- Black's bishop on c8 is undeveloped
4. Threats:
- White is threatening to capture the knight with h5xg6
- Black needs to deal with this threat while maintaining counterplay
Candidate moves to consider:
a) g6h5 - This blocks the threat but leaves the knight pinned and potentially trapped
b) f6d5 - Moves the knight to a central square, but allows h5xg6
c) g8h8 - Castling to safety but still leaves the knight issue
d) f6g4 - Moves the knight forward with tempo on the rook
e) g6g5 - Pushes the pawn to defend the knight
After careful consideration:
- f6g4 looks tempting as it attacks the rook, but after h4h3, Black's knight is still in trouble
- g6g5 seems best as it solidly defends the knight while opening the g-file for Black's rook
- g8h8 is also reasonable but doesn't address the immediate threat as directly
The most solid move is g6g5, maintaining the knight's defense while keeping options open for future play. It also prevents White from opening the h-file with h5xg6.
```

2025-06-22 01:07:07,794 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.94s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a rook, bishop, queen, knight and pawns vs White's equivalent pieces). The position is dynamically balanced.
2. Key features:
- White has a strong pawn center and active pieces (rook on e4, bishop on h6)
- Black's king is still in the center (e8) which could be dangerous
- The h6 bishop is very strong, controlling key squares
- Black has a passed g-pawn that could become dangerous
3. Threats:
- White may look to play Qh5+ soon, targeting the weak h7 pawn
- White could also consider doubling rooks on the e-file
- Black needs to address king safety while maintaining counterplay
4. Candidate moves:
a) g8h8 - castles by hand, but leaves the rook passive
b) g8g7 - develops the rook but blocks the bishop
c) f6h5 - challenges the strong bishop but allows Qxh5
d) f6d5 - centralizes the knight, attacks e4
e) e7e6 - prepares to develop the bishop and castle
After careful consideration:
- f6d5 looks tempting but after exd5, Black's structure is compromised
- e7e6 is solid, preparing to develop the dark-squared bishop
- g8g7 is playable but blocks the bishop's diagonal
- f6h5 is too risky due to Qxh5
The best move is e7e6, which:
1. Prepares to develop the bishop to e7 or d6
2. Opens the possibility of castling
3. Maintains flexibility in the position
4. Doesn't create any weaknesses
Here's the move:

2025-06-22 01:07:50,377 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.73s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except Black has an extra pawn)
2. White has a strong bishop on h6 pinning the f6 knight to the king
3. Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited shelter
4. White has pressure on the e-file with rook on e3 and queen on e2
5. Black's knight on f6 is under attack by the bishop and potentially by White's queen
Key observations:
- The immediate threat is White's bishop on h6 attacking the knight
- Black needs to address this while also improving king safety
- The knight has limited safe squares (h5, d5, e4 are possible)
Candidate moves to consider:
1. f6h5 - moves the knight but leaves it on the rim which is often suboptimal
2. f6d5 - centralizes the knight but allows exd5 opening the e-file
3. g8h8 - gets the king out of the e-file but doesn't solve the knight issue
4. e8e7 - moves the king but into potential discovered attacks
5. d8e7 - blocks the pin but leaves the knight hanging
After careful consideration:
- f6d5 seems most principled, centralizing the knight
- After exd5, Black can play ...Qxd5 maintaining material balance
- This keeps the position dynamic and doesn't concede any immediate advantage
The alternatives either leave the knight vulnerable or worsen king safety. While d5 allows the exchange, it's the most active response.

2025-06-22 01:08:43,136 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 19.61s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Q+R+B+N vs Q+R+B+N, pawns equal)
2. King safety:
- White's king is somewhat exposed on e1, but has some protection
- Black's king is still in the center (e8), which is dangerous
3. Piece activity:
- White has active pieces: Rook on e3, Bishop on g2, Queen on e2
- Black's knight on d5 is well placed, but other pieces are passive
- Black's dark-squared bishop is trapped on c8
4. Pawn structure:
- White has a strong pawn center (d4) and potential to push f4
- Black has doubled pawns on the e-file (e6,e7)
5. Immediate threats:
- White's rook on e3 is eyeing the e6 pawn
- White could play f4 soon to challenge Black's g5 pawn
Candidate moves to consider:
A) King safety moves:
- e8e7 (getting the king out of the center)
- g8h8 (preparing to castle by hand)
B) Developing moves:
- d8f6 (activating the queen)
- d5e7 (but this blocks the e-pawn)
C) Counterplay moves:
- d5f4 (aggressive knight jump)
- g5g4 (pawn push)
After careful consideration:
- e8e7 seems too passive and blocks the bishop
- g8h8 is reasonable but doesn't address the center
- d8f6 looks interesting but after Qxf6, Black's structure is damaged
- d5f4 is tempting but after g3xf4 gxf4, White has strong play
The best move seems to be d5e3, removing the active white rook and gaining material after Qxe3. However, this is not in the legal moves list (I must have missed it in the initial scan).
Looking again at legal moves, the most promising is d5f4, creating immediate threats and complications. After g3xf4 gxf4, Black can follow up with Qh4+ with strong attacking chances.
Therefore, the best move is:
```
d5f4
```

2025-06-22 01:09:43,286 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.74s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a knight and pawn for bishop and pawn). However, White has a strong bishop on g7 that's very active.
2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous. White's king is also uncastled but slightly safer.
3. Key threats: White has pressure along the e-file with the rook on e3 and queen on e2. The bishop on g7 is very strong.
4. Black's immediate concerns:
   - Need to address the bishop on g7
   - Need to safeguard the king
   - The knight on f4 is under attack by the pawn on g3
5. Candidate moves to consider:
   - g8h8: Gets the king to safety but leaves the bishop issue
   - d8e7: Connects rooks but blocks the e-file
   - f4g6: Counterattacks the bishop but allows Nxg6
   - f4d5: Centralizes the knight but allows Bxd5
   - f4h3: Threatens the g2 bishop but is risky
   - e6e5: Opens the position but may be dangerous
After careful consideration:
- g8h8 is too passive and doesn't solve the bishop issue
- f4g6 looks tempting but after Nxg6 hxg6, White has strong pressure
- d8e7 is solid but blocks the e-file
- The best move appears to be f4d5, centralizing the knight. After Bxd5 exd5, Black gets the bishop pair and opens the e-file for counterplay.
Here's the move:

f4d5

2025-06-22 01:10:34,361 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.55s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook on a1, Rook on e6, Queen on e2, Bishop on g2, Knight on d2, Knight on g1, pawns on a2, b3, c3, d4, f3, g3, h5
- Black has: Rook on a8, Bishop on c8, Queen on d8, King on e8, Knight on d5, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g5, h7
Material is roughly equal, but White has a strong initiative with the rook on e6 and pressure on the e-file.
2. Key observations:
- White's rook on e6 is very active and pinning the pawn on e7
- Black's king is exposed with the pawn on g5 having advanced
- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous
- Black's knight on d5 is under attack by White's bishop on g2
3. Evaluating candidate moves:
- d8e7: This would block the pin on the e-file, but after Qxe7 Rxe7, Black loses the queen for rook and bishop
- d5e7: This seems desperate as the knight would be captured by the rook
- f7e6: This would capture the rook but allow Qxe6+ with a discovered attack on the queen
- d7e6: This seems the most resilient, capturing the rook while maintaining material balance
4. After d7e6:
- White would likely play Qxe6+
- Black can then play Qe7, exchanging queens
- The resulting position would be roughly equal with both sides having rooks and minor pieces
This seems like the best practical chance to maintain balance in the position. The other options either lose material immediately or lead to worse positions.

2025-06-22 01:11:22,318 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 18.03s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a bishop on g7, bishop on g2, knight on d2, knight on g1, pawns on b3, c3, f3, g3, h5
- Black has a rook on a8, bishop on c8, queen on d8, king on e8, knight on d5, pawns on a7, b7, c7, e6, f7, g5, h7
- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces
2. Key observations:
- White's bishop on g7 is very strong, pinning the f7 pawn to the king
- Black's king is exposed in the center with White's pieces well coordinated
- Black's knight on d5 is under pressure from White's pawn on c3
- White has a passed pawn on h5 which could become dangerous
3. Threats:
- White threatens to play Qxe6+ winning material
- White could also play Nf4 attacking the knight on d5
- The h5 pawn could advance to h6 creating more pressure
4. Candidate moves:
- d5e7: Blocking the queen's path to e6, but allows Nxe7 Qxe7 and White's pieces become even more active
- d5f6: Defends e6 but blocks the bishop and leaves the knight awkward
- e8e7: Moving the king out of danger, but allows Qxe6+ fxe6 Bxe6 with strong attack
- d8e7: Covers e6 but leaves the queen passive
- g8h8: Castling by hand to safety, but White has Qxe6+ fxe6 Bxe6 with strong initiative
After careful consideration, the best move seems to be g8h8, attempting to get the king to relative safety while maintaining material balance. While it allows some initiative for White, other moves lead to more immediate problems.

2025-06-22 01:12:06,943 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.52s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material: Black is down a bishop (B vs N) but has a passed d5 pawn. White has a strong pawn center and active pieces.
2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8 with the g-file open. White's bishop on g7 is very dangerous.
3. Key threats: White has potential threats like Qh4-h6, Bg7-f6, or opening the g-file with g3-g4.
4. Black's opportunities: The d5 knight is well-placed, and Black has some counterplay with the d-pawn and potential to activate the rooks.
Best candidate moves to consider:
a) h8g8 - Gets the king off the open file but still exposed
b) e8e7 - Centralizes the king but leaves it in the line of fire
c) d8e7 - Covers f6 and connects rooks
d) d5e3 - Forking queen and bishop
e) d5f6 - Blocking the bishop's diagonal
After careful consideration:
- d5e3 looks tempting but after Nxe3, Black's position remains passive
- h8g8 is too passive
- d8e7 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threats
- d5f6 is the most forcing move, blocking the dangerous bishop and creating counterplay
The best move is d5f6, which:
1. Blocks the dangerous bishop on g7
2. Attacks the bishop, forcing it to move or be traded
3. Maintains the knight's central presence
4. Prepares potential ...f5 to challenge White's center

2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8 with White's bishop on g7 controlling important squares. White's king is relatively safer on e1.
3. Piece activity: White's pieces are more active - the bishop on g7 is very strong, queen on e4 is centralized, and rooks are connected. Black's queen is still on d8 and rook on a8 is inactive.
4. Threats: White has potential threats like Qh4 targeting h7, or pushing the h-pawn to h6. Black needs to address these while activating his own pieces.
Key observations:
- The bishop on g7 is White's most dangerous piece
- Black's king is in a precarious position
- Black needs to activate his queen and rook while securing his king
Candidate moves to consider:
1. h8g8 - Gets the king away from the h-file but still exposed
2. e8e7 - Centralizes the king but leaves the rook hanging
3. d8d7 - Develops the queen but blocks the bishop
4. f6d5 - Centralizes the knight with tempo on the queen
After careful consideration:
- f6d5 looks most promising as it attacks the queen while developing the knight to a strong central square. After Q moves, Black can consider ...Qd6 or ...Bd7 to complete development.
The move f6d5 accomplishes:
- Develops the knight with tempo
- Controls key central squares
- Opens possibilities for ...Bd7 or ...Qd6
- Doesn't weaken the king's position further
Other moves either leave the king exposed or don't improve piece activity sufficiently.
```
f6d5

2025-06-22 01:13:22,486 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.38s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Q+R+B+N vs Q+R+B+N), but White has a more active position.
2. Key features:
- White has a strong bishop on g7 pinning the black knight on d5 to the king
- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover
- White's queen is very active on g4, eyeing g7 and h5
- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated
3. Threats:
- White threatens Bxd5, winning the knight due to the pin
- Also potential threats like Qh5 or Qxg5
- Black needs to address the pin immediately
4. Candidate moves:
- h8g8: Gets the king off the pin but leaves it exposed
- e8e7: Unpins the knight but exposes the king to checks
- d5e7: Counterattack, but allows Qxg5+
- d5f6: Blocks the bishop but allows Qxg5+
- d8f6: Defends g7 but leaves the knight pinned
After careful consideration:
- h8g8 seems most prudent, getting the king to relative safety while maintaining the knight's defense
- Other moves either lose material or expose the king too much
- The position remains complicated, but this keeps Black in the game
The best move is:
```
h8g8

2025-06-22 01:14:04,268 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.56s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)
2. White has a strong bishop on e5 and queen on g4 eyeing the black king
3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with weak pawn cover
4. White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous
5. Black's knight on d5 is well placed but could be vulnerable
6. White has pressure along the g-file and h5-e8 diagonal
Key threats/ideas:
- White could play Qxg5 soon, winning a pawn
- White might try to open the g-file with g4 at some point
- Black needs to safeguard the king while maintaining counterplay
Candidate moves to consider:
1. g8h8 - moves king away from immediate threats but still leaves it exposed
2. e8f8 - connects rooks but doesn't solve king safety
3. d5e7 - blocks the e5 bishop but leaves the knight passive
4. d5f6 - challenges the strong bishop but may be risky
5. d8f6 - develops queen to a more active square
6. f7f5 - challenges white's queen but opens the position
After careful consideration, d8f6 seems the most promising:
- Develops the queen to an active square
- Puts pressure on f2 and h4
- Prepares potential queen trade if needed
- Doesn't weaken the king's position further
- Maintains flexibility for future plans
The alternatives either leave the king too exposed or don't improve black's position sufficiently.

2025-06-22 01:14:43,804 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.89s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, knight, queen vs White's rook, two bishops, knight, queen). 
2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on e8 with White's bishop on e5 controlling important squares. White's king is also somewhat exposed on e1.
3. Key threats:
   - White's queen on g4 is eyeing the g7 pawn which is pinned to the king by the bishop on e5.
   - Black's queen on f6 is somewhat trapped and needs to find safety.
4. Critical observations:
   - The g7 pawn is under attack and pinned. Moving it would lose the queen (if g7g6 then Qxg6+).
   - The bishop on e5 is very strong and needs to be challenged or eliminated.
   - Black's rook on a8 is inactive.
After considering several candidate moves:
- f6g7 seems tempting to defend the pawn but allows Qxg5 winning a pawn
- e8f8 gets the king to safety but doesn't address the pin
- d5e7 challenges the strong bishop but after Bxe7 Qxe7, White's pressure continues
- f6h6 looks interesting to get the queen to safety while maintaining defense of g7
The best move appears to be f6h6, which:
1. Gets the queen to safety
2. Maintains defense of the g7 pawn
3. Keins the option of Qh4+ in some lines
4. Doesn't allow White to immediately exploit the pin on g7
Other moves either lose material or allow White to maintain strong pressure. f6h6 seems like the most resilient option that maintains Black's position.
```

2025-06-22 01:15:38,139 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.97s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Q+R+B+N vs Q+R+B+N), but White has a more active position with their pieces better coordinated.
2. Key features:
- White has a strong bishop on e5 and queen on g4, putting pressure on Black's position
- Black's king is exposed in the center (e8)
- Black's knight on d5 is well-placed but under attack
- White has a passed pawn on b4 that could become dangerous
3. Threats:
- White is threatening to capture the knight with c4xd5
- White's queen and bishop battery on the g-file is dangerous
- White's rook on b1 is eyeing the b7 pawn
4. Candidate moves to consider:
a) d5e7 - moving the knight to safety while attacking the bishop
b) g8g7 - getting the rook out of the pin on the g-file
c) e8f8 - moving the king to safety
d) h6g7 - moving the queen to defend the rook
After careful consideration:
- d5e7 looks tempting but after Qxg5, Black loses material
- g8g7 seems passive and doesn't address the immediate threats
- e8f8 is safer but doesn't solve the knight issue
- h6g7 is the most resilient, defending the rook and maintaining queen activity
The best move is to defend the rook while keeping the queen active and maintaining pressure on White's position. The queen can later swing to h5 or f6 if needed.

2025-06-22 01:16:26,825 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.34s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Q vs Q, R vs R, minor pieces balanced). Black has a passed d-pawn but it's currently blocked.
2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on e8 with White's queen and bishop eyeing it. White's king is also somewhat exposed on e1.
3. Key threats: White has strong pressure with queen on g4 and bishop on h3 pointing at Black's king. Black's knight on d5 is well-placed but needs support.
4. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Safeguards the rook but doesn't address king safety
- e8f8: Gets the king away from the diagonal but still exposed
- d5e7: Centralizes the knight and defends f5
- g7h6: Challenges White's strong queen
- f7f5: Pushes the pawn to challenge White's bishop
After careful consideration:
- g7h6 seems tempting to challenge the queen, but after Qxh6 Rxh6 Bxh6, Black loses material
- e8f8 is safer but still leaves the king vulnerable
- d5e7 is solid, covering f5 and preparing to bring the knight to more active squares
- f7f5 is interesting but weakens e6
The best move appears to be d5e7, which:
- Gets the knight to a more active central post
- Defends the f5 square
- Prepares potential knight maneuvers to f5 or g6
- Doesn't create any new weaknesses

2025-06-22 01:17:23,121 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 18.12s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, 4 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, 6 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.
2. King safety:
- White's king is somewhat exposed on e1
- Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous
- White has strong attacking potential with the queen on g4 and bishop on h3
3. Key observations:
- White's pawn on h6 is threatening to promote soon
- Black's queen is under attack by White's bishop on e5
- Black's king is vulnerable to potential discovered checks from the bishop on e5
4. Critical threats:
- Immediate threat is White playing Bxg7 winning the queen
- White could also play Qxg5 with a strong attack
5. Candidate moves to consider:
- g7h6: Capturing the dangerous pawn but allows Bxg7 next
- e7g6: Blocking the bishop's attack on g7 but leaves king exposed
- e8f8: Moving the king to safety but still leaves queen vulnerable
- g7f8: Moving queen to defend the king but looks awkward
After careful consideration:
- g7h6 seems forced to stop the pawn, but after Bxg7 Qxg7, White has Qxg5 with a strong attack
- e7g6 is better, blocking the bishop's attack. After Bxg7 Qxg7, we can play Qxg5 and be okay
- The best move is to first protect the queen with e7g6, then after Bxg7 we can recapture with the queen
The most resilient move is e7g6, which blocks the bishop's attack while maintaining material balance and king safety.
```
e7g6

2025-06-22 01:18:19,779 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.54s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Black is down a bishop (B vs N) but has an extra pawn. The position is roughly equal material-wise, but White has a strong attacking setup with queen on g4 and bishop on h3 eyeing the black king.
2. King safety: Black's king is exposed in the center (e8) with White's pieces well-coordinated to attack it. The h6 pawn is pinned to the king by the bishop on g7.
3. Immediate threats: White's queen on g4 is threatening to capture the g5 pawn with check (Qxg5+), which would be devastating. We must address this threat first.
4. Candidate moves to consider:
   - g6h8: Moves the knight to safety while covering the g7 bishop
   - g6e7: Blocks the e-file and defends g5
   - e8d8: Moves the king to relative safety
   - f7f6: Creates luft for the king but weakens e6
After careful consideration:
- g6h8 seems best as it both saves the knight and defends the bishop on g7, maintaining control of f7 square
- e8d8 would run into Qxg5+ Kd7 Qxg7 winning material
- g6e7 would block the bishop's defense of g5, allowing Qxg5+ anyway
- f7f6 weakens the king's position too much
The move g6h8 solves the immediate threat while keeping pieces coordinated. White can't take g5 because after Qxg5+ Ng6 would block with tempo on the queen.

2025-06-22 01:19:31,657 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.30s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a bishop, knight, queen, and some pawns
- Black has a rook, bishop, knight, and pawns
- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces
2. Key observations:
- White's queen on g4 is very active and threatening
- Black's king is exposed on e8 with White's bishop on h3
- White has a passed pawn on h6 that could be dangerous
- Black's knight on h8 is awkwardly placed
3. Threats:
- White could play Qxg5 winning a pawn
- White might try to push the h-pawn to promotion
- White could bring more pieces to attack the exposed black king
4. Candidate moves:
- h8g6: Develops the knight to a better square, but allows Qxg5
- g8f8: Gets the king to safety but doesn't address other threats
- e8d8: King moves away from potential checks
- f7f5: Counterattacks in the center and blocks the bishop's diagonal
After careful consideration, f7f5 seems the most principled move:
- It blocks the bishop's diagonal to the king
- Gains space in the center
- Prepares potential counterplay with ...e5
- Prevents immediate Qxg5 as the pawn is now defended by the rook
The other moves either don't address the threats or create new weaknesses. While f7f5 does weaken the e6 pawn, it's necessary to deal with White's active pieces.

2025-06-22 01:21:04,565 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.08s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook, Queen, Bishop, Knight, 4 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 6 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.
2. Key features:
- White's queen and bishop battery on the g-file is dangerous
- Black's king is exposed in the center (e8)
- White has pressure on the f5 pawn
- Black's knight is trapped on h8
3. Immediate threats:
- White could play Qxg5, winning a pawn
- White could play Bxf5, also winning a pawn
- White has potential for a mating attack with Qg7
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- h8f7: Gets the knight out but blocks the f7 square for king
- e8f7: King moves toward safety but into potential checks
- f5f4: Counterattack but weakens kingside
- c7c5: Creates counterplay in center
- e8d8: King moves away from danger
After careful consideration:
- e8f7 seems too dangerous due to potential Qg7+ and discovered checks
- h8f7 blocks the king's escape route
- f5f4 allows Bxf4 with strong attack
- e8d8 is the safest option, moving the king away from immediate threats while keeping options open
The best move is to get the king to safety while maintaining flexibility. 
```

2025-06-22 01:22:38,150 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.78s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns
- Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns
- White is up a queen for a rook and bishop - this is a significant material advantage for White
2. King safety:
- White's king is somewhat exposed on e1
- Black's king is on d8, also exposed but has some pawn cover
3. Immediate threats:
- White's queen on f4 is eyeing the f7 pawn and potentially the d6 square
- White's bishop on h3 is very active, controlling the long diagonal
- White has threats like Qxf5 or Qd6+
4. Black's best options:
- Need to defend against immediate threats while trying to create counterplay
- The move g5g4 looks interesting to challenge White's strong bishop
- However, after g5g4 Bxg4, White's bishop becomes even more active
- d8e7 might be better to bring the king to safety
- h8f7 could be considered to defend the f5 pawn but leaves the rook passive
5. Long-term considerations:
- Need to activate the rook on a8
- Need to find some counterplay against White's strong pieces
- Need to prevent White from consolidating their material advantage
After careful consideration, the best move seems to be d8e7, bringing the king to a safer position while keeping options open for the rook. This prevents immediate threats like Qd6+ and prepares to potentially activate the rook via e8.

2025-06-22 01:24:08,994 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.35s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook, Queen, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 4 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 6 pawns
Black is down a minor piece (Bishop vs 2 Bishops + 2 Knights)
2. King safety:
- White's king is somewhat exposed on e1
- Black's king is on e7, which is not ideal but not immediately under attack
3. Key features:
- White has strong pressure with the queen on f4 and bishop on h3
- Black's knight is trapped on h8
- Black's pawn structure is compromised with doubled f-pawns
- White has a passed c-pawn that could become dangerous
4. Immediate threats:
- White threatens Qxf5 winning a pawn
- White could also play Qh4+ forcing the king to move
5. Candidate moves to consider:
- h8g6 - trying to free the trapped knight
- g5f4 - trading pawns to relieve pressure
- e7e8 - moving the king away from potential checks
- c7c5 - challenging White's pawn center
After careful consideration:
- h8g6 looks tempting but after Bxg5 the knight is still trapped
- g5f4 is interesting but after Qxf4 White maintains strong pressure
- e7e8 seems passive and doesn't address immediate threats
- c7c5 is the most principled move, challenging White's center and opening lines for Black's pieces
The best move is c7c5, as it:
- Challenges White's central pawn structure
- Opens the c-file for potential counterplay
- Prevents White from playing c5 himself with a strong passed pawn
- Maintains flexibility for Black's pieces

2025-06-22 01:25:39,888 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.46s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen, rook, bishop, knight, and some pawns
- Black has rook, bishop, knight, and pawns
- Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active
2. Key features:
- White has strong pressure on the kingside with queen on f4 and bishop on h3
- Black's king is exposed on e7
- White has a passed pawn on d5
- Black's rook on h8 is under attack by White's bishop on g7
3. Immediate threats:
- White is threatening to capture the rook on h8 with Bxh8
- If we don't defend this, we lose material
4. Candidate moves to consider:
a) h8f7 - moving the rook to f7 to defend the king
   - But after Qxf5, we're in trouble
b) h8g6 - moving the rook to g6
   - White can play Qxf5 with tempo
c) e7d8 - moving the king away
   - But then Bxh8 wins material
d) e7f7 - moving the king to f7
   - This seems most resilient, getting the king out of danger while keeping material
5. After e7f7:
- If White plays Bxh8, we have Rxh8 and we've traded bishop for rook
- Our king is safer on f7 than e7
- We maintain material equality
Other moves either lose material immediately or leave the king in danger. e7f7 is the most resilient option that maintains our position.
After careful consideration, the best move is:
```
e7f7
```

2025-06-22 01:27:42,787 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.33s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has a more active position with better coordinated pieces.
2. Key features:
- White has a strong pawn center with d5 and c4 pawns
- Black's king is exposed on f7
- White's queen is very active on e3
- Black's rook on h8 is undeveloped
- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous
3. Immediate threats:
- White could play Qe3-h6 with a strong attack
- White might play Nf3 or Ne4 to increase pressure
- The h6 pawn is threatening to promote
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- h8g6: Develops the rook and defends against Qh6
- f7e7: Moves the king to a safer square
- f7g6: Moves the king but leaves it exposed
- e6d5: Capturing the pawn but opening lines
- f5g4: Pushing the pawn but weakening the position
After careful consideration:
- h8g6 seems best as it develops the rook and prevents Qh6
- f7e7 is too passive and allows White to continue attacking
- e6d5 opens the position when our king is exposed
- f5g4 weakens our pawn structure
The move h8g6:
- Develops the rook
- Covers h6 against queen checks
- Prepares to double rooks on the g-file
- Maintains some defensive coordination
All other moves either leave the king too exposed or allow White to build up dangerous threats. While the position remains difficult, h8g6 is the most resilient move.

Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns
- Black has rook, bishop, knight, pawns
- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces
2. Key features:
- White's king is exposed on e1
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on f7
- White has a passed pawn on d5
- Black's g6 knight is well placed
- White's dark-squared bishop on h3 is very strong
3. Threats:
- White could play Qf3+ next move, forcing our king to move
- White might try to push the d-pawn or activate the rook
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- g6e5: Centralizing the knight, attacking d3 and c4 pawns
- f7e7: Moving the king to a safer square
- g6h4: Attacking the bishop on h3
- e6d5: Taking the passed pawn
After careful consideration:
- e6d5 seems tempting but after cxd5, White's pieces become more active
- f7e7 is safe but passive
- g6h4 looks interesting but after Bg2, we lose time
- g6e5 is the most active move, centralizing the knight and creating threats

2025-06-22 01:32:51,180 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.06s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns
- Black has rook, bishop, knight and pawns
- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces
2. Key features:
- White's queen is very active on d4
- Black's king is exposed on f7
- White has a passed pawn on d5
- Black's knight on e5 is well-placed but potentially vulnerable
- White has pressure along the b-file with rook on b1
3. Threats:
- White could play Qxe5, winning a piece
- White might play Bg2, increasing pressure on the diagonal
- White could push the d-pawn further
4. Candidate moves to consider:
a) e5d7 - moving the knight to safety while attacking the bishop
b) f7e7 - moving the king to a safer square
c) e5g6 - moving the knight to defend the king
d) f5f4 - counterplay in the center
After careful consideration:
- e5d7 looks tempting but after Nxd7, Qxd7, White's queen becomes even more active
- f7e7 is safer but passive
- e5g6 allows Bxg6+ hxg6, opening the h-file for White's rook
- f5f4 creates counterplay and opens the f-file for our rook
The best move is f5f4, creating immediate counterplay and opening the f-file. This also prevents White from playing g5-g6 ideas in the future. The pawn sacrifice is justified by the activity it generates.
```
f5f4

2025-06-22 01:33:21,620 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.54s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen, rook, bishop, knight, and several pawns
- Black has rook, bishop, and pawns
- White is up a queen for a rook and bishop - significant material advantage
2. Key features:
- White's queen is very active on e5
- White has a passed pawn on d5
- Black's king is exposed on f7
- White's pieces are coordinating well
3. Threats:
- White threatens Qxe6 winning a pawn
- White could also play Qxg5 winning another pawn
- White has potential mating threats with the queen and bishop battery
4. Candidate moves:
- f7e8: Gets the king to slightly safer square but still exposed
- f7g6: Moves king toward center but into potential discovered attacks
- g8g7: Brings rook to defend but allows Qxg5
- c8d7: Develops bishop but doesn't address immediate threats
5. Best defensive try:
We need to minimize material losses while trying to activate our pieces. f7e8 seems most prudent as it:
- Gets the king away from immediate threats
- Keeps the rook on g8 defended
- Maintains some coordination between pieces
Other moves either lose material immediately or leave the king too exposed. While the position is difficult, f7e8 gives the best chance to resist.

- White's queen on d6 is very powerful, eyeing the a6 pawn and controlling key squares
- White's bishop on g7 is pinning the f8 rook to the king
- White has strong pawn structure with passed pawns on c and d files
3. King safety:
- Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited protection
- White has attacking pieces nearby (queen, bishop, rook)
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Gets the rook out of pin but doesn't address other issues
- e8f7: Moving the king away from danger but into potential discovered attacks
- c8d7: Developing the bishop but allows Qxa7
- e6d5: Trying to challenge the center but cxd5 leaves black's structure weak
After careful consideration, the best move is to get the king to relative safety while maintaining some coordination between pieces. e8f7 seems most prudent, despite the potential discovered attack, because:
- It moves the king away from the dangerous e-file
- After Kf7, if white plays Qxa7, black can respond with Ra8 trapping the queen
- Other moves either leave the king in danger or lose material immediately
The discovered attack after Kf7 isn't immediately dangerous as white's pieces aren't perfectly placed to exploit it yet.

e8f7

2025-06-22 01:33:55,654 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.26s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, bishop, and 4 pawns
- Black has 2 rooks, bishop, knight, and 5 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active
2. Key features:
- White's queen on d6 is very powerful, eyeing both the a6-f1 diagonal and the d-file
- White has a passed pawn on d5 that could become dangerous
- Black's king is exposed on f7 with White's bishop on h3 controlling important squares
- Black's rook on g8 is awkwardly placed
3. Threats:
- White threatens to play Qe7+ winning the rook on g8
- White could also play Rd1 with strong pressure on the d-file
- Black needs to address the immediate threats while improving his position
4. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Gets the rook out of danger but leaves the king exposed
- f7e8: Moves the king away but allows Qe7+ winning the rook
- g8g7: Blocks the bishop's diagonal but leaves the rook passive
- c8d7: Develops the bishop but doesn't address immediate threats
- f7g6: Moves the king to a safer square
After careful consideration, f7g6 seems best because:
- It moves the king to a safer square away from checks
- It maintains the defense of the rook on g8
- It keeps options open for future counterplay
- It doesn't create any immediate weaknesses
Other moves either lose material or leave the king too exposed. While g6 isn't ideal, it's the least bad option in a difficult position.

2025-06-22 01:35:06,238 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.30s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Rook, 6 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.
2. Key features:
- White has a strong passed pawn on b4 supported by the rook
- Black's king is exposed on g6
- White's bishop on h3 is very active, controlling key squares
- Black's pawn structure is compromised with doubled f-pawns
- White has pressure along the b-file and h3-c8 diagonal
3. Threats:
- White threatens to play Rb6, attacking the e6 pawn
- White could also play Nc4, putting pressure on e5 and d6
4. Candidate moves:
- g6f7: Moving the king to safety but allows White to play Rb6
- a8b8: Doubling rooks on the b-file to defend b6
- e6d5: Trying to open the position but cxd5 would leave Black's structure weak
- b6c5: Trying to challenge the b4 pawn but White can play bxc5
5. Best move:
After careful consideration, a8b8 is the most solid choice. It:
- Defends the b6 pawn
- Prepares to double rooks on the b-file
- Maintains control of the back rank
- Doesn't create any new weaknesses
Other moves either expose the king or create pawn weaknesses. The rook is currently not doing anything on a8, so activating it makes sense.

2025-06-22 01:35:46,146 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.49s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Rook, 5 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but White has a strong passed pawn on c5 and better piece coordination.
2. Key features:
- White's bishop on h3 is very strong, controlling key squares
- Black's king is exposed on g6
- White has pressure on the f4 pawn
- Black's rooks are not optimally placed
3. Candidate moves to consider:
a) g8g7 - Bringing the rook to a more active position
b) c8d7 - Developing the bishop
c) b6c5 - Challenging White's strong pawn
d) b8a8 - Moving the rook to a safer square
4. Analysis:
- b6c5 looks tempting to challenge the pawn, but after Rxc5 Bxc5, White gets strong connected passed pawns
- c8d7 seems passive and doesn't address immediate threats
- b8a8 is safe but doesn't improve our position
- g8g7 is most active, preparing to double rooks or defend the king
5. Best move:
g8g7 activates our rook and prepares to potentially bring the other rook to g8. It also helps defend our king position. White's threats are not immediate, so we should improve our piece activity.
After g8g7, possible continuations might involve bringing the other rook to g8 or preparing counterplay with ...f5 at some point.

2025-06-22 01:36:29,104 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.68s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 4 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Rook, 5 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but black has an extra pawn which could be significant in the endgame.
2. King safety:
- White's king is exposed on f2
- Black's king is relatively safe on g6
3. Pawn structure:
- White has doubled pawns on the b-file
- Black has a passed pawn on b6 that could become dangerous
- Both sides have pawn weaknesses that could be exploited
4. Piece activity:
- Black's rooks are more active than white's
- White's knight on d2 is somewhat passive
- Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by its own pawn on b7
Candidate moves to consider:
a) b6b5 - Pushing the passed pawn, but this allows c4xb5 and the pawn might not be as strong after this exchange.
b) g6h6 - King move to h6, but this seems unnecessary as the king is safe on g6.
c) c8d7 - Developing the bishop, but it doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately.
d) b8a8 - Rook move to a8, but this seems passive.
e) g7f7 - Centralizing the rook, putting pressure on f4 and potentially supporting ...f4-f3 ideas.
After careful consideration, g7f7 seems the most promising:
- It centralizes the rook
- Puts pressure on f4
- Prepares potential ...f4-f3 pushes
- Keeps all options open for other pieces
- Doesn't create any weaknesses
The other moves either don't improve our position or have drawbacks. The rook on f7 can become very active in supporting both kingside and queenside play.

2025-06-22 01:37:05,253 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.59s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 4 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Rook, 3 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces and better pawn structure.
2. Key features:
- White has a passed pawn on e6 that's well-supported
- Black's king is exposed on g6
- White's pieces are more coordinated (rook on b4, bishop on h3)
- Black's rooks are not optimally placed (b8 and f7)
3. Threats:
- White could play Nf4+ attacking the king
- White could push the e-pawn further
- Black needs to activate his pieces while preventing White's threats
4. Candidate moves:
- f7f6: Blocks the e-pawn but allows Nf4+ with tempo
- f7f5: Similar issues as f6
- g6h6: Gets the king to safety but gives up control of f6
- b8a8: Activates the rook but doesn't address immediate threats
- c8d7: Develops the bishop but leaves the e-pawn unopposed
5. Best move seems to be c8e6:
- Blocks the dangerous passed pawn
- Develops the bishop to a more active square
- Maintains control over key squares
- After c8e6, if White takes exe6, Black can recapture with f7xe6, keeping material balance
This seems like the most principled move that addresses the most pressing issues in the position.
```

2025-06-22 01:37:40,005 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.83s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Black has rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.
2. Key features:
- White has a passed c5 pawn that could become dangerous
- Black's king is exposed on g6
- White's knight on e4 is very strong, controlling key squares
- Black's rook on b8 is passive
- Both sides have pawn weaknesses
3. Threats:
- White could play Nf6+ or Ng5+ to harass the black king
- White may try to push the c-pawn
- Black needs to activate his rook and defend against immediate threats
4. Candidate moves:
- b8h8: Rook lift to h-file to attack h6 pawn
- f7f8: Doubling rooks on the f-file
- e6f5: Bishop move attacking e4 knight
- b6c5: Capturing the passed pawn
After careful consideration:
- b6c5 seems tempting but after dxc5, White's pieces become even more active
- e6f5 looks good, but after Nxf5 Kxf5, White gets strong play with Rf1+
- b8h8 is interesting to attack h6, but White can defend with Rh1
- f7f8 is solid, preparing to bring the rook into play
The best move appears to be activating the rook while maintaining defensive resources:
```
f7f8
```
This prepares to bring the rook to h8 or e8, while keeping options to defend against White's threats. It's a flexible move that improves Black's worst-placed piece.

2025-06-22 01:38:10,927 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.02s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook (b6), Knight (e4), Bishop (h3), pawns (a4,c4,c5,g4,h6)
- Black has: Rooks (b8,f8), Bishop (e6), pawns (b7,g5,p4,h7)
- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces and better pawn structure
2. Key features:
- White's knight on e4 is very strong, controlling many squares
- Black's pawn on f4 is passed but blockaded by White's knight
- White has a protected passed pawn on c5
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g6
- White's h6 pawn is advanced and could become dangerous
3. Threats:
- White threatens to play Nxf6, winning the f4 pawn
- White could also play Rxb7 at some point
- Black needs to defend against these threats while improving his position
4. Candidate moves:
- f8h8: Gets the rook off the f-file where it's doing nothing
- f8f7: Defends the b7 pawn but blocks the bishop
- b8e8: Centralizes the rook but leaves b7 undefended
- g6f7: King moves to a safer square but away from the action
After careful consideration, the best move is f8h8, which:
- Gets the rook off the potentially dangerous f-file
- Prepares to double rooks on the h-file to counter White's h-pawn
- Keeps options open for future rook maneuvers
- Doesn't create any new weaknesses
Other moves have drawbacks:
- f8f7 blocks the bishop's diagonal
- b8e8 leaves b7 undefended
- King moves away from the center where it might be needed

2025-06-22 01:38:47,442 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.83s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Rook, Bishop, Knight and pawns)
2. King safety: Black's king is slightly exposed but not in immediate danger
3. Pawn structure: White has a passed c-pawn but it's well-blocked by Black's bishop
4. Piece activity: Black's rook on h8 is passive, while White's rook is more active
5. Threats: White has potential threats with the knight (Nc5 or Nd6 ideas)
Key observations:
- Black's bishop on e6 is very strong, controlling important squares
- White's knight on e4 is well-placed but can be challenged
- The h6 pawn is passed but currently blocked by Black's h7 pawn
Candidate moves to consider:
1. h8g8 - Centralizing the rook
2. e6f5 - Challenging White's strong knight
3. b7b5 - Creating counterplay on the queenside
4. e6g4 - Attacking the h3 bishop
After careful consideration:
- e6f5 looks tempting to challenge the knight, but after exf5 gxf5, White gets the e4 square for his pieces
- b7b5 creates immediate counterplay and opens the b-file for the rook
- h8g8 is solid but doesn't create active play
The best move is b7b5, as it:
1. Creates immediate counterplay on the queenside
2. Opens the b-file for Black's rook
3. Challenges White's pawn structure
4. Maintains all of Black's piece activity
```

2025-06-22 01:39:36,365 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.95s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.
Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (Rook vs Rook, minor pieces balanced)
2. Black has doubled rooks on the 8th rank
3. White has a passed pawn on h6 that could be dangerous
4. Black's bishop is active but could be trapped if not careful
5. White's knight is well-placed on c3, controlling key squares
Candidate moves to consider:
1. h8g8 - Doubling rooks on the g-file to pressure g4
2. e6f5 - Bishop move attacking the pawn chain
3. b5c4 - Pawn exchange to open lines
4. g6h6 - Capturing the dangerous h-pawn
Let me evaluate these:
1. h8g8:
   - Puts pressure on g4 pawn
   - But white can defend with f3
   - Doesn't address the h6 pawn threat
2. e6f5:
   - Attacks the g4 pawn
   - But after gxf5 gxf5, white gets active play
   - Bishop might get trapped after Nxd5
3. b5c4:
   - Opens the b-file for the rook
   - But after bxc4 Rxc4, white gets counterplay
4. g6h6:
   - Eliminates the dangerous passed pawn
   - After gxh6, black can play Rh8 to control the h-file
   - This seems most principled as it removes white's main threat
After g6h6 gxh6, black can follow up with Rh8 putting strong pressure on the h-file. White's pieces are somewhat tied down defending the weak h-pawn.
The other moves either don't address the immediate danger or create new weaknesses. Capturing the h-pawn is the most forcing and removes white's main asset in the position.

2025-06-22 01:40:16,275 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 17.33s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material - Black has rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, bishop and pawns.
2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h6, while White's king is relatively safer on e2.
3. Pawn structure:
   - Black has doubled isolated pawns on the b-file (b5) and g-file (g5)
   - White has a passed pawn on c5 and potential passed pawn on a-file
   - White's pawn structure is generally better
4. Piece activity:
   - Black's rooks are connected but not very active
   - White's rook on b4 is very active, eyeing the b5 pawn
   - White's knight on b1 is passive but can be rerouted
   - Black's bishop on e6 is active but could be more so
Key observations:
- White is threatening to play Rb5, winning the b5 pawn
- Black needs to defend the b5 pawn while maintaining piece activity
- The h6 king is somewhat exposed to potential checks
Candidate moves to consider:
1. b8b7 - Defends the b5 pawn but blocks the bishop
2. e6f7 - Moves bishop to a more active diagonal while defending b5
3. e6d5 - Centralizes bishop and defends b5
4. b5c4 - Pawn sacrifice to open lines
After careful consideration:
- b8b7 is too passive and blocks the bishop
- e6f7 is interesting but doesn't address the rook pressure
- b5c4 is too risky as it gives White connected passed pawns
- e6d5 is the most flexible, defending b5 while centralizing the bishop and keeping options open
The best move is:
```
e6d5
```
This move:
1. Defends the b5 pawn
2. Centralizes the bishop
3. Keeps options open for both rooks
4. Doesn't create any new weaknesses
5. Maintains piece coordination

2025-06-22 01:41:04,101 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.33s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook, Knight, Bishop, 3 pawns
- Black has: 2 Rooks, Bishop, 2 pawns
Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop pair)
2. Key features:
- White has a passed pawn on b5 that's well supported
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h6
- Black has doubled rooks on the 8th rank
- White's pieces are well coordinated (rook on b4, knight on b1, bishop on h3)
3. Threats:
- White may try to push b5-b6 creating a dangerous passed pawn
- Black's rooks could potentially double on the b-file to stop the pawn
- Black's bishop is very active and could create threats
4. Candidate moves:
a) h8g8 - Centralizing the rook, but doesn't address immediate threats
b) b8b5 - Challenging the passed pawn immediately
c) d5f3 - Attacking the knight and threatening to win material
d) h6g7 - Improving king safety
After careful consideration:
- b8b5 seems most principled, directly challenging White's main threat (passed pawn)
- After b8b5, White would likely recapture with a4xb5, then we can double rooks on the b-file with h8b8
- This would effectively neutralize White's passed pawn and maintain equality
- Other moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow White to make progress
The move b8b5 also maintains our active bishop on d5 which is a strong piece.
Here's the move:
```
b8b5

2025-06-22 01:41:52,349 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.02s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: Rook, Knight, Bishop, 3 pawns
- Black has: 2 Rooks, Bishop, 2 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but black has the more active pieces.
2. King safety:
- White's king is exposed on f2
- Black's king is relatively safe on h6
3. Piece activity:
- Black's rooks are very active (h8 and b5)
- Black's bishop is strong on d5, controlling key diagonals
- White's rook on e4 is pinned to the king by black's bishop
4. Threats:
- Black can consider playing Rd8 to double rooks on the d-file
- The pawn on g4 is weak and could be a target
- Black might want to activate the h8 rook further
5. Candidate moves:
- d5g8: Bishop sacrifice to expose white's king
- h8g8: Centralizing the rook
- b5b1: Attacking the knight
- d5e4: Exchanging bishops to remove the pin
After careful consideration:
- d5g8 looks tempting but after Kxg8, black doesn't have enough follow-up
- b5b1 is interesting but white can defend with Nc3
- h8g8 is solid, preparing to double rooks
- d5e4 is strong as it removes the pin and maintains pressure
The best move is d5e4, exchanging bishops and maintaining control of the position while removing white's active bishop. After Bxe4, Rxe4, black can then consider doubling rooks or activating the king.

2025-06-22 01:42:23,428 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.80s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: pawn (c5, a4, g4), knight (c3), bishop (h3), king (f2)
- Black has: rook (h8, b5), bishop (e4), pawn (g5, h7), king (h6)
Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces and better pawn structure.
2. Key observations:
- White's king is more exposed than Black's
- Black's bishop is very strong, controlling many squares
- White's pawn on c5 is passed and dangerous
- Black's rooks are not optimally placed (h8 is passive, b5 is blocking the bishop)
3. Threats:
- White could play Nxe4, but after Rxe4 the position remains balanced
- White could push c6, but Black can respond with Bxc6
- White's king is vulnerable to checks
4. Candidate moves:
a) h8g8 - activating the rook, but not immediately threatening
b) e4f3 - attacking the knight and threatening discovered checks
c) b5b8 - moving the rook to a more active file
d) e4g6 - attacking the g4 pawn
After deep consideration, e4f3 seems the most forcing and disruptive move:
- Attacks the knight on c3
- If knight moves, we get discovered checks against White's king
- If knight takes (Nxf3), then Rxf3 gives Black active play
- It also prevents White from playing Nxe4
Other moves like b5b8 or h8g8 are less forcing and allow White to consolidate.
Here's the move:

2025-06-22 01:42:54,415 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.97s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.
Key features of the position:
1. Material is roughly equal - Black has rook + rook + bishop vs White's knight + knight + bishop
2. Black's king is exposed on h6, but White's king is also exposed on e2
3. Black has two rooks that can coordinate, while White's knights are somewhat passive
4. The passed pawn on c5 is dangerous but currently blockaded by the rook on b5
5. White's bishop on h3 is very active, controlling key squares
Candidate moves to consider:
1. Rook moves (h8 or b5): Need to maintain control of key squares
2. Bishop moves: Could try to exchange White's strong bishop or attack the king
3. King moves: Might want to bring the king to safer squares
Looking at forcing moves first:
- f3g2 attacks the knight on e2 and threatens mate
- f3e4 also attacks the knight but less forcing
After f3g2:
- If White plays Ne2xg2, then h8e8+ wins the knight
- If White moves the king, we can follow up with rook checks
Other options:
- b5b8 looks tempting to double rooks, but White has Nf2-e4 ideas
- h8e8+ immediately is possible but after Ke2-f1 we don't have a clear follow-up
The most forcing and strongest seems to be f3g2, creating immediate threats against White's exposed king while maintaining our positional advantages.

2025-06-22 01:43:23,704 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.41s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: King, Knight, Knight, Bishop, 2 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.
2. Key features:
- White's pawn structure is more advanced (passed pawn on c5)
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h6
- White's pieces are coordinating well (both knights and bishop)
- Black's rooks are not optimally placed (one on h8, one on b5)
3. Threats:
- White could play Nf3+ next move, forking king and rook
- White's c-pawn is dangerous and needs to be stopped
- Black's bishop on g2 is powerful but could be trapped
4. Candidate moves:
a) h8g8 - moves rook to defend along the 8th rank
b) b5b8 - brings rook back to defend
c) g2h3 - trades off White's dangerous bishop
d) f4f3 - creates a passed pawn
After careful consideration:
- h8g8 is too passive
- b5b8 is better but still doesn't address immediate threats
- g2h3 is tempting but after Bxh3, White's pieces become more active
- f4f3 creates a passed pawn and opens lines for Black's rooks
The best move is f4f3, creating a passed pawn and opening lines for Black's rooks to become active. This also prevents White from playing Nf3+ next move.

2025-06-22 01:43:51,957 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.95s):
Let me analyze this position carefully. The key features are:
1. Material is roughly equal (Black has rook + bishop vs White's knight + bishop + pawn), but White has a passed c-pawn that could become dangerous.
2. Black's king is exposed on h6, while White's king is relatively safer on g1.
3. Black has two rooks (on h8 and b5) that can become active, while White's pieces are somewhat tied down defending against threats.
4. White has a dangerous passed pawn on c5 that needs to be addressed.
Looking at candidate moves:
- h8g8/h8f8/etc: Moving the rook along the 8th rank doesn't seem immediately productive
- h6g7: King moves away from potential checks but doesn't accomplish much
- b5b8: This looks interesting - it defends the back rank and could support the b-pawn's advance
- b5c5: Capturing the dangerous passed pawn, but after Nxc5 White's pieces become more active
- g2h3/g2h1: Bishop moves that don't seem to create immediate threats
- f3f2: Pushing the pawn threatens to promote, but White can defend with Bxf2
The most critical issue is White's passed c-pawn. Capturing it with b5xc5 seems necessary, even though it activates White's knight. The alternatives allow the pawn to advance further, becoming more dangerous.
After b5xc5 Nxc5, Black can then activate the rooks and look for counterplay against White's king. The position remains complex but this seems the most principled approach.

2025-06-22 01:44:19,710 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.39s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: King, Knight, Bishop, 2 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns
Black is up a rook and pawn, which is a significant material advantage.
2. King safety:
- White's king is exposed on g1 with black's bishop on g2 controlling important squares
- Black's king is relatively safe on h6
3. Immediate threats:
- Black's bishop on g2 is attacking white's knight on d1
- Black's rook on h8 could potentially join the attack
- White's bishop on h3 is controlling some important squares but isn't immediately threatening anything
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- h8g8/h8f8/h8e8 - bringing the rook into play towards the white king
- c5c1 - pinning the knight to the king
- g2h1 - attacking the knight and forcing it to move
- f3f2 - advancing the pawn to create more threats
After careful consideration:
- c5c1 looks very strong as it pins the knight to the king
- After c5c1, white has no good way to defend the knight (if it moves, black can play g2h1 winning material)
- Other moves like bringing the rook into play are good but not as immediately decisive
The most forcing and decisive move is c5c1, which will win material and maintain the winning advantage.

2025-06-22 01:44:52,799 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.62s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: 1 knight, 1 bishop, 2 pawns
- Black has: 1 rook, 1 bishop, 2 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but the position is very sharp.
2. Key features:
- White's king is exposed on h2
- Black's rook is active on h8
- Black's bishop on g2 is very dangerous
- White has a passed a-pawn but it's not immediately threatening
- Black has connected passed pawns on g5 and f3
3. Threats:
- Black's immediate threat is ...f3-f2, forcing White's king to h1, then ...g2-h1# (bishop mate)
- White's bishop on h3 is preventing ...g2-h1 mate for now
4. Candidate moves:
- f3f2: This seems strong, forcing the king to h1
- g2h1: Doesn't work because of the bishop on h3
- h8h2: Rook sacrifice, but after Kxh2 f2 White can defend
- Other rook moves don't seem as forcing
5. Best continuation:
After f3f2 Kh1, Black can play g2h3 (sacrificing the bishop) and then f2f1=Q# next move. White can't prevent this.
Let me verify:
- f3f2 Kh1 (forced)
- g2h3 (sacrificing bishop to remove the defender)
- Now if Bxh3, then f2f1=Q#
If White doesn't take, Black can play ...Rh8-h2# next move
This seems like a forced mate in 3 moves. The immediate f3f2 is the key move that starts this sequence.
```
f3f2

Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: King, Bishop, Knight, 2 pawns
- Black has: Rook, Knight, 2 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but Black has a dangerous passed pawn on f2 that's about to promote.
2. Key features:
- White's king is exposed on h2
- Black's f2 pawn is one square from promotion
- White has a knight on d1 that's not very active
- Black's rook on h8 is very active
3. Immediate threats:
- Black can promote the f2 pawn in several ways
- White's bishop on g2 is defending against promotion
- White has no immediate threats against Black
4. Candidate moves:
a) f2f1q - promoting to queen is most natural
b) f2f1r - promoting to rook might be safer to avoid stalemate tricks
c) h8h2 - rook sacrifice to deflect the bishop
d) c1 moves - but these seem less urgent
5. Analysis:
- f2f1q looks strong, but after Bxf1, White's bishop remains guarding key squares
- f2f1r is interesting because after Bxf1, Rxf1 would win the bishop
- h8h2 is tempting but after Kxh2 f1=Q, White has Kg2 and might hold
- The safest and strongest seems to be f2f1r, as it maintains the threat while being less risky than queening
6. Conclusion:
Promoting to a rook is the most precise move here, as it maintains all of Black's advantages while minimizing any counterplay. After Bxf1, Rxf1 will win the bishop and maintain a decisive material advantage.

2025-06-22 01:45:56,816 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.14s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: 1 bishop, 2 pawns
- Black has: 2 rooks, 1 knight, 1 pawn
Black is up a rook for a bishop, which is a significant material advantage.
2. King safety:
- White king is on h2, somewhat exposed
- Black king is on h6, but relatively safe with pawn cover
3. Piece activity:
- Black has two active rooks and a knight
- White's bishop is active but alone
- White's pawns are not threatening
4. Threats:
- Black can potentially coordinate the rooks to create mating threats
- White has no immediate threats
5. Candidate moves:
- Rook moves: f1f8 looks strong, controlling the 8th rank and potentially doubling rooks
- Knight moves: c1d1 could be useful to bring the knight closer to the action
- King moves: h6g6 or h6g7 to centralize the king
After careful consideration, f1f8 is the most promising move:
- It controls the 8th rank
- Prepares to double rooks with h8f8 next move
- Limits White's options
- Maintains all of Black's advantages
Other moves like h6g6 are also reasonable, but f1f8 is more active and pressing.

2025-06-22 01:46:34,993 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 12.60s):
Let me analyze this position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: 1 bishop, 2 knights, 2 pawns
- Black has: 2 rooks, 1 knight, 2 pawns
Material is roughly equal, but black has the more active pieces
2. King safety:
- White king is exposed on h2
- Black king is relatively safe on h6
3. Key features:
- White's bishop on e4 is very strong, controlling important squares
- Black has doubled rooks on the f-file which could be powerful
- White's pawn structure is slightly better with connected passed pawns
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- f8f2: Immediate attack on the white king
- c1c8: Bringing the knight to more active squares
- h8g8: Consolidating the rooks
- f8f1: Controlling the first rank
After careful consideration:
- f8f2 looks tempting but after Kxf2, Rxf2+ Kxf2, Nxe4+ wins the bishop but leaves black with rook vs 2 knights which may not be winning
- c1c8 is interesting but doesn't create immediate threats
- The best move appears to be f8f1, controlling the first rank and preparing to double rooks with h8f8 next move. This maintains maximum pressure while keeping all options open.
Here's the move:

Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- Black has: Rook (h8), Rook (f1), Knight (c1), pawn (h7), pawn (g5)
- White has: Bishop (g6), Knight (d1), Knight (b1), pawn (a4), pawn (g4)
- Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces
2. King safety:
- White's king is exposed on h2
- Black's king is relatively safe on h6
3. Key observations:
- White's bishop on g6 is very strong, controlling important squares
- Black has two rooks that can coordinate
- The knight on c1 is somewhat passive
- White has doubled knights which might be awkward
4. Candidate moves:
- h8f8: Centralizing the rook, but allows White to play Nf2+
- f1f8: Doubling rooks on the f-file, but White can respond with Nf2+
- h6g7: King move to escape potential checks
- f1f2: Attacking the knight on d1
- c1d3: Developing the knight
After careful consideration:
- h6g7 seems passive and allows White to consolidate
- f1f8 is interesting but allows Nf2+ which could be annoying
- c1d3 develops the knight to a better square while maintaining control
The best move appears to be c1d3, which:
- Develops the knight to a more active square
- Prepares potential threats like Nd3-f4+
- Doesn't allow any immediate counterplay from White
- Maintains control over key squares

Apologies for the oversight. Let me re-examine the legal moves and the position more carefully.
Key observations:
1. White's bishop on g6 is very strong, eyeing the h7 pawn and controlling key squares
2. Black's rooks are active but not optimally placed
3. The knight on c1 is restricted
4. White's king is exposed on h2
Best candidate moves from the legal options:
1. f1f2 - Attacks the knight on d1 and prepares to double rooks
2. h8f8 - Centralizes the rook and prepares to double on the f-file
3. h6g6 - King moves to challenge the bishop
4. h7g6 - Capturing the bishop, but this would leave Black's king very exposed
After careful consideration:
- h7g6 is too risky as it opens the h-file for White's rooks
- h6g6 allows Bxh7 winning a pawn
- h8f8 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats
- f1f2 is the most active move, attacking the knight and preparing to double rooks
The best move is f1f2, which:
- Attacks the knight on d1
- Prepares to double rooks with h8f8 next
- Maintains control of the position
- Doesn't allow White any counterplay
```
f1f2

2025-06-22 01:47:38,945 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 17.27s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.
Key features of the position:
1. Material is roughly equal (Black has rook + knight vs White's bishop + knight)
2. Black's rook is very active on h8
3. White's bishop is strong on g6, controlling key squares
4. Both kings are exposed
5. White has a passed a-pawn that could become dangerous
Candidate moves to consider:
1. h8g8 - centralizing the rook
2. h6g7 - moving the king to a safer square
3. c1c8 - doubling rooks on the 8th rank
4. h7g6 - capturing the bishop
Let me evaluate each:
1. h8g8:
   - Centralizes the rook
   - But doesn't address the immediate threats
   - White could play a5-a6 with a dangerous passed pawn
2. h6g7:
   - Gets the king away from potential checks
   - But allows White to play a5-a6
   - The bishop on g6 remains very strong
3. c1c8:
   - Doubles rooks which is powerful
   - But White can play a5-a6 immediately
   - The bishop still controls key squares
4. h7g6:
   - Captures the strong bishop
   - After h7g6, Nxg6 Kxg6
   - Then White has Nxg5, but Black can play Rg8 with counterplay
   - This seems most forcing and eliminates White's strong bishop
After h7g6 Nxg6 Kxg6 Nxg5:
- Black can play Rg8 attacking the knight
- White's knight has to move, then Black can push the g-pawn
- The a-pawn is less dangerous without the bishop supporting it
This seems like the most concrete way to improve Black's position by eliminating White's strong bishop and activating the rook.

2025-06-22 01:48:00,082 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.29s):
Let me analyze this position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: King, 2 Knights, 2 pawns
- Black has: King, Rook, pawn, and another Rook (h8)
2. Key observations:
- White's king is exposed on h2
- Black has two rooks that can coordinate
- The h-pawn is passed but blocked by the knight on g6
- White's knights are somewhat scattered
3. Candidate moves to consider:
a) Rook moves (h8): Need to activate the rook while keeping pressure
b) Rook moves (c1): Can consider doubling rooks or attacking the king
c) King moves: Not ideal as we want to keep pressure
4. Best options:
- Rc1h1 looks very strong, immediately threatening mate on h1
- White's only defense would be to move the king, but then we can bring the other rook into play
- Other rook moves don't create immediate threats
- King moves would be too passive
5. Why Rc1h1 is best:
- Forces white to respond to the mate threat
- After Kh2-g3, we can play Rh8-h1 with devastating effect
- White's knights can't defend against this double rook attack
- The passed h-pawn will eventually decide the game
6. Calculating variations:
- If Rc1h1, white must move Kg3 (only legal move)
- Then Rh8h1 is mate
- Any knight moves would still allow mate
Therefore, the most forcing and decisive move is:
```
c1h1
```

2025-06-22 01:48:18,529 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.29s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has 2 knights and 2 pawns
- Black has a rook and 2 pawns
Material is roughly equal (rook ≈ 2 knights, pawns equal)
2. King safety:
- White king is relatively safe on h1
- Black king is exposed on g6 but not immediately threatened
3. Pawn structure:
- White has pawns on a4 and g4
- Black has pawns on g5 and h6
- Black's pawns are more advanced but potentially vulnerable
4. Key observations:
- White's knights are well placed to control squares
- Black's rook is currently passive on h8
- The h6 pawn is a potential weakness
5. Candidate moves:
- h8h7: Brings rook to more active position, defends h6 pawn
- h6h7: Advances pawn but makes it more vulnerable
- Rook moves along 8th rank: Not particularly useful
Best move seems to be h8h7, activating the rook while defending the h6 pawn. This prepares potential future rook maneuvers to attack white's pawns or support black's own pawn advances.
Other moves:
- h6h7 would weaken the pawn structure
- Rook moves along 8th rank don't accomplish much
- h6g7 would leave the h-pawn undefended
Therefore, the best move is:
```

2025-06-22 01:48:38,279 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.52s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- Black has a rook and pawns
- White has two knights and pawns
- Material is roughly equal, but the position favors Black due to more active pieces and passed pawns
2. Key features:
- Black has a passed g-pawn that's very dangerous
- White's knights are somewhat passive
- Black's rook is very active on the 7th rank
- White's king is somewhat exposed
3. Candidate moves:
- h7h8: Not useful, rook is better placed on the 7th rank
- h7g7: Defends the g-pawn but limits rook mobility
- h7f7: Attacks f2 knight and keeps rook active
- h7e7/d7/c7/b7/a7: These move the rook away from key squares
- h6g7: King moves to support the g-pawn but exposes it to knight forks
4. Best move analysis:
- h7f7 is very strong as it:
  - Attacks the f2 knight
  - Maintains rook's activity on the 7th rank
  - Prepares to push the g-pawn
- After h7f7, White has limited options:
  - If knight moves, we can push g5-g4
  - If knight is defended, we can bring king to g7 to support pawn push
5. Other considerations:
- The g-pawn is our main winning chance
- We must keep the rook active to both support the pawn and restrain White's pieces
- King safety is not an immediate concern here
The best move is clearly h7f7, as it maximizes our activity while maintaining pressure on White's position.

2025-06-22 01:48:57,420 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 17.15s):

Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: King + 2 Knights + 2 pawns
- Black has: King + Rook + 2 pawns
Material is roughly equal (rook vs 2 knights), but the position favors Black due to more active pieces and passed pawns.
2. Key features:
- Black has a passed g-pawn that's well supported
- White's knights are somewhat passive
- Black's rook is very active on the 7th rank
- White's king is somewhat exposed
3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f7f8 - rook to 8th rank, increasing pressure
- f7h7 - rook to h-file, eyeing h2 pawn
- h6h7 - king moves forward, but may be premature
- f7f6 - rook retreat, but seems passive
4. Evaluation:
The most promising is f7h7, threatening to capture the h2 pawn next move (h7h2). White cannot defend it easily:
- If White moves a knight to protect h2, we can push our g-pawn
- If White moves king to h1, we can play h7h2 anyway, forcing the king to g1 and then we can push g5-g4
Other moves like f7f8 are also good, but f7h7 seems more direct and threatening. The h2 pawn is a key target that White will struggle to defend while also stopping our g-pawn.
After f7h7, possible continuation:
- White might play Nf2 (to defend h2), then we push g5-g4
- Or Kh1, then we take h2 anyway
In both cases, Black's position improves.
Therefore, the best move is:
```
f7h7
```

2025-06-22 01:49:17,572 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.55s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully:
1. Material is equal (Rook vs Knight + Knight + pawns)
2. Black has a passed g-pawn that's well advanced (g5)
3. White's pawn structure is split with a4 and g4 pawns
4. White's king is somewhat exposed on h2
5. Black's rook is currently on h7
Key observations:
- Black's g-pawn is the most dangerous passed pawn
- White has two knights that can potentially blockade or attack the pawn
- The immediate threat is pushing g5-g4 to create a passed pawn
- The rook should ideally support the pawn's advance while keeping the white king at bay
Candidate moves:
1. h7h8 - Rook to the back rank (but doesn't help the pawn push)
2. h7g7 - Rook behind the pawn (good support)
3. h7f7 - Rook to the f-file (less direct support)
4. h6g7 - King moves to support pawn (but exposes king)
Best move seems h7g7:
- Places the rook directly behind the passed pawn
- Prepares g5-g4 push
- Maintains control of the 7th rank
- Prevents white knights from easily attacking the pawn
- If white tries to blockade with Ne4, we can push g4 anyway
Other moves either don't support the pawn or expose the king unnecessarily. The immediate g5-g4 push isn't possible yet as the pawn would be lost after Nxg4.
After h7g7, white's options are limited:
- If they try to blockade with Ne4, we can push g4 anyway
- If they move their king, we can advance the pawn
- If they move a knight, we can push the pawn
This seems like the most forcing and principled move in the position.

2025-06-22 01:49:33,904 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.06s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Both sides have equal material - White has a knight and a pawn, Black has a rook and two pawns. However, Black's pawns are more advanced.
2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h2, while Black's king is relatively safe on g6.
3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a4 and g4, Black has pawns on g5 and h6. Black's pawns are more dangerous as they're closer to promotion.
4. Immediate threats: White's knight on g3 is eyeing the h5 square, but doesn't seem to have any immediate threats. Black's rook is very active.
Key observations:
- Black's rook is currently controlling the 7th rank
- Black's pawns are more advanced and dangerous
- White's pieces are somewhat passive
Best candidate moves:
1. g7g8 - This would allow the rook to potentially support the pawns from behind
2. g7h7 - Keeps the rook active on the 7th rank while protecting the h6 pawn
3. h6h7 - Advances the pawn, but might be premature
After careful consideration:
- g7g8 seems too passive and gives up control of the 7th rank
- h6h7 could be met with Nxh5, complicating matters
- g7h7 maintains maximum activity while protecting the h6 pawn
The best move is to keep the rook active while defending the pawn with:
```
g7h7
```

2025-06-22 01:49:50,214 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.21s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a knight on g3, knight on h1, pawn on a5 and g4
- Black has a rook on h7, pawn on g5, king on g6
2. King safety:
- White's king is on h2, relatively safe
- Black's king is on g6, somewhat exposed but not immediately threatened
3. Pawn structure:
- White has passed pawns on a5 and g4
- Black's g5 pawn is blocking the g4 pawn
4. Immediate threats:
- White's knight on g3 could potentially jump to f5 or e4
- Black's rook is currently controlling the h-file
5. Candidate moves:
- h7h8: Rook retreat, but gives up control of h-file
- h7g7: Keeps rook active and defends g5 pawn
- h6g7: King moves away from potential knight forks
- Other rook moves seem less useful
6. Evaluation:
- Black is slightly better due to more active rook
- Need to maintain control while preventing white's counterplay
- Most important is to defend the g5 pawn and keep the rook active
After considering all options, h7g7 seems best because:
- Maintains rook activity
- Defends the g5 pawn
- Keeps pressure on white's position
- Prevents any knight forks (like Nf5+)
- Doesn't allow white to gain any initiative
Other moves either give up control or don't improve the position as much.

2025-06-22 01:50:07,677 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.48s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- Black: King (h6), Rook (g7), Pawn (g5)
- White: King (g2), Knight (g3), Knight (h1), Pawn (a5), Pawn (g4)
2. Positional factors:
- Black's king is somewhat exposed but defended by the rook
- White has two knights which can be dangerous in the endgame
- Black's passed g-pawn is potentially dangerous but currently blocked
- White's a-pawn is advanced but not immediately threatening
3. Candidate moves:
- g7g8: Rook moves forward, but doesn't accomplish much
- g7h7: Defends the h-file against knight checks
- g7f7: Opens potential for rook to swing to queenside
- h6h7: King moves forward, but might be too risky
4. Threats to consider:
- White could play Ng3-e4, attacking the g5 pawn
- White could try to coordinate knights to create mating threats
- White's king is well placed to support the g-pawn
5. Best move analysis:
- h6h7 seems too risky as it brings the king forward where it could be vulnerable to knight forks
- g7h7 is solid, defending against potential knight checks on h-file
- g7f7 is interesting as it prepares to swing the rook to queenside to stop the a-pawn
The most important strategic considerations are:
1. Keep the king safe
2. Maintain control over the g-pawn
3. Prepare to stop White's a-pawn
After careful consideration, g7f7 seems the most flexible move, preparing to bring the rook to the queenside while still maintaining some control over the kingside.

2025-06-22 01:50:24,577 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.69s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.
Key features of the position:
1. Material: Black has a rook vs White's two knights
2. Pawns: White has connected passed pawns on a6 and g4, Black has a pawn on g5
3. King positions: White king is on g2, Black king on h6
4. Rook is currently on f7
Evaluation:
- This is a theoretically drawn position with correct play, but very tricky
- Black's main goal is to prevent White's pawns from advancing while keeping the rook active
- The rook must stay mobile to control both sides of the board
- Black's king is somewhat exposed but can defend if needed
Candidate moves to consider:
1. f7f8 - brings rook to 8th rank, but might be too passive
2. f7h7 - pins the knight on h1, but allows White to play g4-g5
3. f7g7 - blocks the g-pawn, but may allow White counterplay
4. h6h7 - king moves forward, but seems risky
5. f7a7 - rook goes after the a-pawn, but gives up control of g-pawn
Best move seems to be f7a7, going after the a-pawn while maintaining some control over the g-pawn. The rook can always return to the kingside if needed.
After 1...Ra7, possible continuation:
2. g4-g5 Kxg5
3. Nxg5 Rxa6
And Black should be able to hold the draw with active rook play.
```
f7a7

2025-06-22 01:50:40,561 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.30s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a knight, king and passed a-pawn (on a6)
- Black has a rook, king and two pawns (g5 and h6)
2. Key features:
- White's a-pawn is very advanced and dangerous
- Black's rook is currently blocking the a-pawn
- White's knights are well placed to support the pawn or attack
- Black's king is somewhat exposed near the passed pawn
3. Immediate threats:
- White wants to promote the a-pawn
- Black needs to keep the rook active to prevent this
4. Candidate moves:
a) a7a8 - promotes the rook but allows a7 (pawn promotes with check)
b) a7h7 - rook moves to h-file, but allows a7
c) a7g7 - keeps rook active while protecting g5 pawn
d) h6h7 - king moves forward but allows rook to be harassed
e) h6g7 - king moves to g7, centralizing but may be too passive
After careful consideration:
- a7a8 is bad as it allows immediate a7 with check
- h6h7 or h6g7 don't address the pawn threat
- a7h7 leaves the g5 pawn undefended
- a7g7 seems best as it keeps the rook active while defending g5 pawn
The move a7g7 maintains maximum activity for the rook while defending the g5 pawn. It also keeps options open to swing the rook to the kingside if needed.

2025-06-22 01:50:59,015 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.53s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a pawn on a6, knight on h3 and g3, king on g2
- Black has a rook on g7, pawn on g5, king on h6
- Material is roughly equal (White has 2 knights vs rook, but pawns are equal)
2. Key features:
- White's a-pawn is advanced but blockaded by Black's rook
- Black's king is more active than White's
- White's knights are well placed but lack targets
- Black's g-pawn is a potential passer
3. Candidate moves:
- g7g8: Rook retreat - not useful
- g7h7: Rook keeps pressure on h-file
- g7f7/e7/d7/c7/b7/a7: Rook moves along 7th rank
- h6h7: King moves forward
4. Evaluation:
- The position is roughly equal but Black has some initiative
- The key is to activate the king while maintaining the rook's control
- h6h7 seems most promising as it brings the king closer to the action
- After h6h7, White cannot prevent h7g6 next move, penetrating with the king
- The rook should stay on g7 to maintain control of the a-pawn
5. Other options:
- Rook moves along 7th rank don't achieve much
- h6h7 is the most active move, creating threats
Best move:
```
h6h7

2025-06-22 01:51:23,079 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 18.66s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.
Current position analysis:
- Material: Black has a rook and king vs White's knight, knight, and king. White has a passed a-pawn that's about to promote.
- White's a-pawn is on a6, very close to promotion (a7 would be queening).
- Black's rook is on g7, king on h7.
- White's knights are on e4 and h3, king on g2.
- Black's pawns are on g6 and g5, White has a pawn on g4.
Key observations:
1. White's a-pawn is extremely dangerous. If it promotes, White will have a decisive material advantage.
2. Black's rook must stop the a-pawn from promoting, but it's currently on g7.
3. Black's king is somewhat exposed on h7.
Candidate moves:
1. g7a7 - immediately stopping the pawn, but this allows White to play Ne4xg5 with a discovered attack on the rook
2. g7g8 - moves the rook to a safer square while still controlling the a8 queening square
3. h7h6 - moves the king to a safer square
4. g7f7 - moves the rook to a more central position
Best move analysis:
- g7a7 seems most direct but after 1...g7a7 2.Nxg5, Black loses the rook to 3.Nf7+
- g7g8 is safer and maintains control of the a8 square
- h7h6 doesn't address the immediate threat of the a-pawn
- Other rook moves away from the a-file allow a7-a8=Q
The best move is g7g8, which:
1. Keeps the rook safe from knight attacks
2. Maintains control over the a8 queening square
3. Prepares to potentially double on the a-file if needed
4. Doesn't allow any immediate tactical shots from White
After g7g8, White will likely push a6-a7, and then Black can play a8a7 to capture if the pawn promotes, or maintain the blockade.

2025-06-22 01:51:44,406 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.82s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a knight (e4), knight (h3), pawn (a6), pawn (g4) and king (f1)
- Black has a rook (g8), pawn (g6), pawn (g5) and king (h7)
2. Key observations:
- White has two connected passed pawns on the a-file and g-file
- Black's rook is currently passive on g8
- White's knights are well-placed to support the pawns
- Black's king is somewhat restricted by the white pawn on g4
3. Threats:
- White can push a6-a7 soon, creating a dangerous passed pawn
- White's knights can potentially coordinate to create threats
4. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves rook to h-file but doesn't improve its activity
- g8f8: Gets rook more centralized
- g8a8: Could challenge the a-pawn but leaves king vulnerable
- h7h6: Moves king forward but into potential knight forks
- h7g7: Moves king towards center but exposes to checks
5. Best move analysis:
The most active move is g8f8, centralizing the rook where it can:
- Potentially support the g-pawns
- Be ready to swing to the queenside if needed
- Maintain some defensive capabilities
- Avoid being trapped by knight maneuvers
Other moves either don't improve the rook's position or expose the king unnecessarily.

2025-06-22 01:52:05,300 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.54s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: 1 knight (e4), 1 knight (h3), 1 pawn (a6), 1 pawn (g4)
- Black has: 1 rook (f8), 1 pawn (g6), 1 pawn (g5), king (h7)
Material is roughly equal, but White has two active knights against Black's rook.
2. Key features:
- White's pawn on a6 is dangerous and could promote if not stopped
- Black's rook is currently passive on f8
- White's knights control important squares
- Black's king is somewhat exposed
3. Threats:
- White could play Nf5+ next move, attacking the king
- White might push a6-a7, threatening promotion
4. Candidate moves:
a) f8a8 - immediately stops the a-pawn but leaves rook passive
b) f8f1 - checks the king and gains some activity
c) h7g7 - moves king to safer position
d) f8f4 - attacks the g4 pawn
After careful consideration:
- f8f1+ seems most active, forcing White's king to move (likely to h2)
- Then we can consider bringing our king closer to help (Kg7 next)
- This maintains pressure while also keeping an eye on the a-pawn
The immediate threat of the a-pawn isn't critical yet as it's only on a6, and we can stop it next move if needed.

2025-06-22 01:52:23,354 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.18s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has knight (e4), knight (h3), pawn (a6), pawn (g4)
- Black has king (h7), rook (f1), pawn (g5), pawn (g6)
- Material is roughly equal, but White's pawns are more advanced
2. Key features:
- White's knights are very active and well-placed
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h7
- White's a-pawn is passed but blockaded by Black's king
- Black's rook is currently active on f1
3. Threats:
- White could play Nf5+ or Ng5+ to harass Black's king
- White might try to push the g-pawn to create mating threats
- Black needs to maintain rook activity while keeping the king safe
4. Candidate moves:
- h7h8 - moves king to corner, not ideal
- h7g8 - slightly better but still passive
- h7g7 - keeps king more active
- f1f8 - controls 8th rank, prevents White's king from advancing
- f1f2 - attacks White's king
- f1h1 - threatens mate in 1 (Rh2#)
After careful consideration, f1h1 is the most forcing move as it threatens immediate mate (Rh2#) which White must respond to. This will either win material or force White into a very defensive position.

2025-06-22 01:52:42,170 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.00s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has: 1 pawn (a7), 2 knights (e4, h3), king (g2)
- Black has: 2 pawns (g5, g6), king (h7), rook (h1)
Material is roughly equal, but the position is very sharp.
2. Key observations:
- White's knights are very active and well-placed
- Black's king is exposed on h7
- White's pawn on g4 is passed and dangerous
- Black's rook is currently passive on h1
3. Threats:
- White threatens to play Nf5+ winning the g6 pawn
- White could also push g5-g6 creating a passed pawn
- Black needs to activate the rook while keeping the king safe
4. Candidate moves:
- h7h8: Gets the king away from potential knight forks
- h7g7: Centralizes the king but still exposed
- h1h3: Trades the rook for a knight but leaves black with weak pawns
- h1h2+: Checks the king but after Kg1, the rook has no good follow-up
5. Best move analysis:
- h1h2+ seems tempting but after Kg1, the rook has to retreat
- h7h8 is passive but safe
- h1h3 is interesting as it eliminates a strong knight
After h1h3 Nxh3 Kxh3, black can try to push pawns while white's king is cut off
The best practical chance seems to be activating the rook while eliminating one of white's active pieces. The move h1h3 accomplishes this while maintaining some counterplay.

Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has Queen + Knight vs Black's Rook + 2 pawns
- Black's king is exposed but White's king is also somewhat exposed
2. Immediate threats:
- White's queen controls the h-file, threatening Qh8#
- Black's rook is currently blocking the queen's path to h8
- White's knight covers g7, preventing Black's king from moving there
3. Key observations:
- Black must maintain the rook's defense of h8 to prevent immediate mate
- Any rook move that abandons the h-file would allow Qh8#
- The king has very limited safe squares
4. Candidate moves:
- h7g7 - moves king to g7 but knight covers that square (illegal)
- h7h6 - moves king away from immediate threats but still leaves rook vulnerable
- h3h6 - rook moves but allows Qh8#
- h3h5 - same issue
- h3h4 - same issue
- h3g3 - rook moves laterally but still maintains h-file control
- Other rook moves would abandon the h-file
5. Best move:
- h3g3 is the only move that maintains the rook's defense of h8 while also getting the rook to a more active position
- After h3g3, if White plays Qh8+, Black can respond with Rg8 blocking
- This maintains the defensive barrier while improving the rook's position
All other rook moves either allow immediate mate or don't improve the position. The king has no safe moves that don't walk into check or lose material.

2025-06-22 01:53:13,230 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 12.73s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a queen and knight vs Black's rook and two pawns
- Black's king is exposed but White's king is also somewhat vulnerable
2. Immediate threats:
- White's queen can deliver checks from multiple squares
- White's knight is well placed on e4, controlling key squares
- Black's rook is actively placed on g3, but needs to maintain activity
3. King safety:
- Black's king is on h7, which is somewhat exposed
- White's king is on h2, also exposed but less vulnerable
4. Candidate moves:
- h7g7: Moves king towards center but exposes to queen checks
- h7h6: Keeps king near corner but may be too passive
- g3g4: Attacks the pawn but allows Qh8+ with strong counterplay
- g3h3: Pins the knight but allows Qh8+ immediately
- Other rook moves don't seem as active
After careful consideration:
- g3g4 seems most active, attacking the pawn and maintaining rook's activity
- After g3g4, if Qh8+ Kh6, Black can defend
- Other rook moves either allow immediate checks or lose activity
The best move is to maintain rook activity while preparing counterplay. g3g4 achieves this while attacking the pawn.

2025-06-22 01:53:32,003 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.23s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- Black has a rook and two pawns (g5, g6)
- White has a queen, knight, and king
- Material is roughly equal (rook + 2 pawns ≈ 9 points vs queen ≈ 9 points)
2. King safety:
- Black's king is exposed on h7
- White's king is relatively safe on h2
3. Immediate threats:
- White's queen on a8 controls the a-file and can check the black king
- White's knight on c3 is well-placed and can jump to e4 or d5
- Black's rook on g4 is active but needs to maintain control
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- h7g7: Moves king away from potential checks but into a more confined space
- g4h4: Cuts off white's king from advancing
- g4g3: Attacks the knight and gains space
- g4g1: Could be interesting to threaten back rank mate ideas
5. Best move analysis:
- g4g3 looks strong as it attacks the knight and gains space
- After Nxg3, we can play hxg3, but this leads to a queen vs pawns endgame which might be drawn
- h7g7 is safer for the king but passive
- g4h4 is solid, keeping the rook active and controlling the h-file
The most active and best move seems to be g4h4, maintaining rook activity and controlling key squares while keeping options open. It prevents white's king from advancing and maintains pressure.

- White has a queen and knight vs Black's rook and two pawns
- Black's king is exposed but White's king is also somewhat exposed
2. Immediate threats:
- White's queen can deliver checks from multiple squares
- Black's rook is currently controlling the h-file and can potentially check the white king
3. King safety:
- Black's king is on h7, vulnerable to queen checks
- White's king is on g2, relatively safer but can be checked by the rook
4. Pawn structure:
- Black has connected passed pawns on g5 and g6
- These pawns could become dangerous if advanced
5. Candidate moves to consider:
- h4h6: Rook checks the king while blocking the g6 pawn
- h7g7: King moves away from potential queen checks
- g5g4: Pushes the pawn forward
- h4h1: Rook checks from h1
After careful consideration:
- h4h6 looks strong as it gives a check while also blocking the g6 pawn
- After Kh6, White would likely play Qh8+ forcing Kg5, but then Qg7+ wins the rook
- h7g7 avoids immediate checks but leaves the rook vulnerable
- g5g4 allows White to play Qh8+ with a strong attack
The best move is to give check with the rook while also blocking the pawn:

Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

2025-06-22 01:54:12,336 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.27s):
Let me analyze this position carefully:
1. Material: Black has king + rook + pawn vs White's king + queen + knight. Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very powerful.
2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h7, while White's king is relatively safe on g3.
3. Immediate threats: White's queen on a8 is eyeing the h1 square, but it's not an immediate threat. The knight on c3 controls some important squares.
4. Black's pawn structure: The g5 pawn is passed but blockaded by White's knight. The rook on h6 is active but somewhat exposed.
Looking at the legal moves:
- h7g7: Moving the king towards the center, but this might expose it more to checks
- h6h5: Advances the rook, but doesn't accomplish much
- h6h4: Pins the knight to the king, but White can simply move the knight
- h6h3: Checks the king, but after Kg2 it accomplishes nothing
- h6h2: Doesn't seem useful
- h6h1: Doesn't seem useful
- g5g4: Advances the passed pawn, creating counterplay
The most promising move is g5g4, advancing the passed pawn. This:
- Creates immediate counterplay
- Forces White to deal with the advancing pawn
- May open lines for the rook if the pawn exchanges
- Could potentially create a passed pawn that needs to be stopped
Other moves either don't accomplish much or expose Black's pieces unnecessarily. Advancing the pawn is the most active and challenging move.

2025-06-22 01:54:29,232 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.40s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.
Current position analysis:
- Black king is on h7
- White queen is on a6, white knight on c3, white king on g3
- Black has a pawn on g4 and a rook on h6
- White has no pawns left
Key observations:
1. Material is roughly equal (queen vs rook + pawn), but white has more active pieces.
2. Black's pawn on g4 is advanced but blockaded by the white king.
3. White's queen and knight are coordinating well.
4. Black's rook is currently passive on h6.
Candidate moves to consider:
1. h7h8 - moves king towards corner (potentially risky)
2. h7g8 - moves king towards center
3. h7g7 - keeps king more active
4. h6h5/h4/h3/h2/h1 - rook moves along h-file
5. g6g5 - advances pawn (but this pawn doesn't exist - must be a typo in legal moves)
Best options:
- The rook should become active. Moving it down the h-file to h1 or h2 seems best to create counterplay.
- h7g7 is also reasonable to centralize the king.
After considering all options, the most active move is to bring the rook into play with h6h1, threatening to create counterplay along the first rank. This also prevents any potential back-rank issues in the future.

2025-06-22 01:54:49,621 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.77s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen + knight vs Black's rook + pawns
- Black has two passed pawns (g4 and g6) which are dangerous
2. King safety:
- White king is exposed on g3
- Black king is relatively safe on h7
3. Immediate threats:
- White's queen and knight are coordinating to create threats
- Black's rook can potentially check the white king from various files
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- h1h6 - attacking the queen while defending g6 pawn
- g6g5 - advancing the passed pawn
- h1h3 - checking the white king
Let me evaluate h1h6:
- Qxc6 Rxc6 and Black has rook vs knight with two passed pawns - this looks winning
- But White doesn't have to take: Qd7+ forces Kh8 and then Qd8+ leads to perpetual check
g6g5 looks interesting:
- Creates a passed pawn threat
- But allows Qd7+ Kh8 Qe8+ with checks
h1h3+ seems most forcing:
- After Kh4 (only legal move), then g6g5 creates mate threats
- White can't take the rook due to g5# next move
- White would have to play Qxg6+ Kxg6 and it's a draw by insufficient material
After careful consideration, h1h3+ seems best as it forces immediate concessions from White while maintaining Black's winning chances.

2025-06-22 01:55:15,065 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 18.92s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen + knight vs Black's rook + 2 pawns
- Black's king is exposed while White's king is relatively safe
2. Immediate threats:
- White's queen on c6 is eyeing the g6 pawn
- White's knight on c3 can jump to e4 or d5
- Black's rook on h3 is active but not immediately threatening
3. King safety:
- Black's king is on h7, vulnerable to checks
- White's king is on g2, fairly safe
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- h7h8/g8/g7: Moving the king away from potential checks
- h3h6: Blocking the queen's attack on g6
- g6g5: Advancing the pawn to create counterplay
- h3g3: Pinning the white king to the g-file
After careful consideration:
- h3h6 seems tempting to defend g6, but after Qxg6, Black loses material
- g6g5 allows Qxg6+ followed by Nxg6, losing both pawns
- King moves like h7h8 or h7g7 are passive and don't address threats
- h3g3 is the most active move, pinning the white king to the g-file and creating counterplay
The pin with h3g3 is the best practical chance:
1. It prevents White's king from moving to f3/h3
2. It threatens to win the g4 pawn if White doesn't respond carefully
3. It maintains the rook's activity
White's best response would likely be Qxg6, but then Rxg3+ Kxg3 Qxg6 leads to a queen vs pawns endgame where Black has some drawing chances.
Therefore, the best move is:
```
h3g3
```

2025-06-22 01:55:43,043 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.45s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen + knight vs Black's rook + 2 pawns
- Black's king is exposed while White's king is relatively safe
2. Immediate threats:
- White's queen and knight are coordinating well
- Black's rook is currently attacking White's knight on c3
- White has potential mating threats with queen checks
3. King safety:
- Black's king is on h7, which is vulnerable to queen checks
- Moving the king to a safer square is critical
4. Rook activity:
- The rook on g3 is currently the most active black piece
- It's pinning the knight to the king, which is valuable
- Moving it would release the pin and allow White more freedom
5. Pawn structure:
- Black has passed pawns on g4 and g6
- Advancing g6-g5 would create a passed pawn but may not be urgent
After evaluating all legal moves:
- King moves: h7h8/h7g8/h7g7/h7h6 all leave the king exposed to checks
- Rook moves: Most would release the pin on the knight, except g3h3 which maintains it
- g6g5 advances a pawn but doesn't address immediate threats
The best move appears to be g3h3, maintaining the pin on the knight while also:
- Keeping the rook active
- Preventing White's queen from checking on h1
- Potentially preparing to double rooks if the h-file opens
- Keeping pressure on White's position
Other moves either expose the king too much or release the pressure on White's pieces.

Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen + knight vs Black's rook + 2 pawns
- Black's king is exposed but White's king is also somewhat exposed
2. Immediate threats:
- White's queen and knight are coordinating well
- Black's rook is currently attacking White's knight on c3
- White has potential mating threats if Black's king is exposed further
3. Candidate moves to consider:
- h3h6 - blocks the queen's diagonal and threatens the knight
- h3g3 - pins the knight to the king
- g6g5 - advances the pawn but may weaken the position
- h7h6 - moves the king to a safer square
4. Deep analysis:
- h3h6 looks tempting as it blocks the queen's diagonal and attacks the knight
- However, after h3h6, White can play Qc6xh6+ winning the rook
- h3g3 pins the knight, but White can play Qc6e8+ forcing the king to move, then defend the knight
- h7h6 seems safest, moving the king away from potential checks
- After h7h6, if White takes the rook (Qc6xh3), then g4g3 creates a passed pawn that could be dangerous
5. Best move:
h7h6 is the most solid choice, keeping the rook protected and moving the king to a safer square. It maintains material balance and doesn't create any immediate weaknesses.

2025-06-22 01:56:24,464 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.42s):

Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Black has a rook and pawn vs White's queen and knight. Materially, White is ahead (queen ~9, knight ~3 vs rook ~5, pawn ~1). However, the position is more complex than just material.
2. King safety: Both kings are exposed. White's king is on g2, Black's king is on g6. 
3. Pawn structure: Black has a passed g-pawn that's advanced to g4. White has no pawns left.
4. Immediate threats:
   - White's queen on d6 is very active and controls many squares
   - White's knight on c3 is well-placed
   - Black's rook on h3 is active but somewhat limited
   - Black's g-pawn is a potential threat if it can advance
5. Candidate moves to consider:
   - g4g3: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn threat
   - h3g3: Rook takes control of the g-file
   - h6g5: King moves closer to help the pawn
After careful consideration:
- g4g3 looks tempting to create a passed pawn, but after Kxg3, Black loses the pawn and the position becomes worse
- h3g3 is interesting as it controls the g-file and prevents White's king from approaching, but White can play Qf4 with strong threats
- h6g5 is the most solid move, bringing the king closer to support the pawn while maintaining flexibility
The best move is h6g5, as it:
1. Brings the king closer to support the g-pawn
2. Keeps the rook active on h3
3. Maintains flexibility for future plans
4. Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses
```

2025-06-22 01:56:42,220 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.90s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a queen and knight vs Black's rook and two pawns. White is up in material.
2. King safety:
- White's king is exposed on g2
- Black's king is relatively safe on g5
3. Pawn structure:
- Black has connected passed pawns on g4 and h3
- White has no pawns left
4. Immediate threats:
- Black's rook on h3 is very active and can potentially deliver checks
- The g4 pawn is close to promotion
- White's queen and knight can coordinate to create threats
5. Candidate moves to consider:
- h3h2: Immediate check, but after Kg1, not much progress
- g4g3: Pushing the pawn, but Qxg3 is possible
- g5h4: Moving the king closer to support pawns
- h3h8: Rook lift to threaten back rank
After careful consideration:
- The most promising plan is to push the passed pawns while keeping the rook active
- g4g3 seems tempting but allows Qxg3
- h3h8 is interesting to create threats from the side
- g5h4 is solid, bringing the king closer to support the pawns
The best move is g5h4, bringing the king closer to support the pawn advance while keeping the rook active. This prepares to push the g-pawn next move with king support.

2025-06-22 01:57:07,930 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 17.77s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.
Current position analysis:
- Material: Black has a rook and pawn vs White's queen and knight. Material is roughly equal (5 vs 6 points).
- King safety: Both kings are exposed but White's king is slightly more vulnerable on g2.
- Pawn structure: Black has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h4, while White has no pawns.
- Key features: Black's rook is actively placed on h3, attacking White's knight on c3. Black's king is active on g4.
Candidate moves to consider:
1. h4h5 - advances the passed pawn
2. h3g3 - rook checks the king
3. h3c3 - captures the knight
4. g6g5 - pawn move to free the king
Let's evaluate each:
1. h4h5 - advances the pawn but doesn't create immediate threats. White can respond with Qb3-g3+ forcing our king away.
2. h3g3+ - forces the king to move (Kh2 or Kf2). After Kg3+ Kh2, we can play h4h5 with tempo.
3. h3c3 - wins the knight but after Qxc3, our h-pawn is blockaded by the queen.
4. g6g5 - frees g6 for the king but doesn't create immediate threats.
The best option appears to be h3g3+ first, forcing the king to move, then advancing the pawn with tempo:
1. ... h3g3+
2. Kg2h2 (forced, as Kf2 allows Rf3+ winning the queen)
Now we can play h4h5 with tempo, and the pawn is one step closer to promotion.
After h4h5, White will likely try to stop the pawn with Qb3-g3, but then we can play Rg3xg3 and the h-pawn will be unstoppable.
Therefore, the best move is:
```
h3g3
```

2025-06-22 01:57:38,538 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.17s):
Let me analyze this position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has a queen (Qb3), knight (Nc3) and king (Kf1)
- Black has a rook (Rg3), pawn (g6) and king (Kh4)
- Material is roughly equal (queen + knight vs rook + pawn)
2. King safety:
- White's king is exposed on f1
- Black's king is active on h4 but somewhat exposed
3. Immediate threats:
- White has Qb3-h3+ threat if we move our rook
- Our rook on g3 is controlling important squares near white's king
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- g6g5 - pushes the pawn but weakens h5 square
- g3h3 - trades rooks but leaves our king exposed
- g3f3 - keeps rook active and defends against Qh3+
- h4h5 - advances king but doesn't address immediate threats
- h4g5 - centralizes king but may be risky
After careful consideration:
- g3f3 is the most solid move, maintaining rook activity while preventing Qh3+
- It keeps pressure on white's position and defends against immediate threats
- Other moves either weaken our position or allow white counterplay
The best move is:
```
g3f3
```

2025-06-22 01:58:05,089 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.35s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Black has a rook (f3) and pawns (g6, g4). White has a queen (b3), knight (c3) and king (g2). Material is roughly equal (rook + 2 pawns vs queen + knight).
2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g4, but White's king is also exposed on g2. The pawn on g6 provides some cover for Black's king.
3. Threats: White's queen and knight are coordinating to create threats. The immediate danger is Qxg3+ if we don't defend properly.
4. Candidate moves to consider:
- h4h5: Advances the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats
- f3f2: Pins the white king to the g2 square
- g4g3: Blocks potential queen checks and threatens to win the knight
- f3g3: Offers rook exchange but leaves king exposed
After careful consideration:
- f3f2 looks tempting but after Kxf2, Qxg3+ wins the rook
- g4g3 is strong because:
  * It blocks Qxg3+ threats
  * It threatens to win the knight with ...g3-g2 next move
  * White's queen can't take the pawn due to the pin (Qxg3?? Rg3+ wins the queen)
  * The knight has no safe squares (if N moves, Qxg3 is still impossible due to the pin)
Best move is:
```
g4g3
```

2025-06-22 01:58:22,883 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.05s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen + knight vs Black's rook + pawn
- Black's king is more active (h4 vs White's h1)
- Black has a passed g-pawn that's close to promotion
2. Key observations:
- White's queen and knight are coordinating well to control squares
- Black's rook is currently very active on f3
- The g3 pawn is blocking White's king from getting active
- Black's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger
3. Candidate moves to consider:
- h4h5: Advances king but doesn't accomplish much immediately
- f3f1: Could be strong, threatening mate on h1
- g6g5: Advances the passed pawn but may be premature
- g3g2: Pushes the pawn to create more threats
4. Critical analysis:
- f3f1 looks very strong as it threatens immediate mate on h1 (Qxf1 is forced)
- After f3f1 Qxf1, then g3g2 creates unstoppable promotion threats
- Other moves don't create immediate threats or allow White counterplay
5. Potential lines:
- f3f1 Qxf1 g3g2 and the pawn will queen
- White has no way to stop this while defending their own king
The most forcing and decisive move is f3f1, leading to a forced win. All other moves either don't make progress or give White chances to complicate.

2025-06-22 01:58:41,547 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.41s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- Black: King (h4), Rook (f1), pawn (g3), pawn (g6)
- White: King (g2), Queen (b3), Knight (c3)
2. Key observations:
- White has a queen and knight vs. Black's rook and two pawns
- Black's king is somewhat exposed
- White's pieces are coordinating well (queen+knight can create threats)
- Black's g-pawn is passed but blockaded by White's king
- Black's rook is currently active on f1
3. Threats:
- White could potentially create mating threats with Qe6+ or similar
- Black needs to maintain rook activity while keeping the king safe
4. Candidate moves:
- h4h5: Advances king but may be risky as it moves away from defending g3 pawn
- f1f4: Rook to 4th rank, more active
- f1f2: Checks white king, forcing it to move
- g6g5: Advances pawn but gives up control of f5
5. Best move considerations:
- f1f2 looks tempting as it forces White's king to move (either h3 or h1)
- After f1f2, if Kh1, then Rf1+ Kg2 repeats (potentially forcing a draw)
- If Kh3, then we can consider Rh2+ winning the g3 pawn
- Other rook moves don't create immediate threats
- King moves seem passive and allow White to improve position
The most forcing and active move is f1f2, creating immediate threats and not allowing White to consolidate. It either leads to repetition or potential pawn wins.

2025-06-22 01:59:03,770 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 18.75s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- Black: King (h4), Rook (f2), pawn (g3), pawn (g6)
- White: King (h1), Queen (b3), Knight (c3)
2. Key observations:
- White's queen and knight are coordinating well
- Black's king is somewhat exposed
- White's king is in a corner but relatively safe for now
- Black has two passed pawns (g3 and g6) that could become dangerous
3. Threats:
- White has potential mating threats with queen+knight coordination
- Black's rook is currently controlling the 2nd rank, preventing immediate checks
- The g3 pawn is one square from promotion
4. Candidate moves:
a) Push the g-pawn: g3g2
   - This threatens promotion next move
   - But allows Qxg2 with a discovered attack on the rook
b) Move the rook to a safer square: f2f8
   - Gets the rook away from potential discovered attacks
   - But doesn't address the pawn promotion threat
c) Move the king to h5: h4h5
   - Centralizes the king
   - But might be too slow
5. Best move analysis:
- g3g2 is tempting but after Qxg2, Rf1 (to block checks), White can play Qg3+ winning the rook
- f2f8 is safer but passive
- h4h5 doesn't address immediate threats
- The best move is actually f2f1, blocking potential checks and maintaining control
However, looking deeper:
- After f2f1, White can play Qd5+ forcing the king to move and then Qxg2
- Alternatively, f2h2 prevents checks and maintains rook activity
After careful consideration, the best move is to activate the rook while preventing checks:
```
f2h2
```
This move:
1. Prevents any queen checks along the h-file
2. Maintains rook activity
3. Keeps the option of pushing the g-pawn next move
4. Potentially creates threats against White's king

2025-06-22 01:59:21,563 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.56s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Black has a rook and two pawns vs White's queen, knight and king. Material is roughly equal (rook + 2 pawns ≈ 5 points vs queen + knight ≈ 9 points, but White's pieces are more active).
2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h4, while White's king is somewhat safer on g1.
3. Pawn structure: Black has connected passed pawns on g3 and g6, which could become dangerous if advanced.
4. Immediate threats: White's queen and knight are coordinating well, with potential threats against Black's king.
5. Candidate moves to consider:
- h4h5: Advances the king but doesn't address immediate threats
- h2h1: Would pin the queen to the king if it weren't for the knight protecting
- g3g2: Creates a passed pawn and threatens to promote
- h2g2: Attacks the knight and potentially trades material
After careful consideration:
- g3g2 looks very strong as it creates an immediate passed pawn threat that White must address
- The pawn can't be taken by the king (Kg1xg2) because then Qxb2 would win the rook
- After g3g2, White's best try would be Qxg3, but then Rxg2+ wins the knight
- Other White moves would allow the pawn to promote or lose material
This seems like the most forcing and advantageous move, creating immediate threats that White cannot easily counter without material loss.

2025-06-22 01:59:24,834 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-22 01:59:41,091 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 16.26s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count:
- White has queen + knight vs Black's pawn + pawn
- Black is down significant material but has some counterplay with the passed g-pawn
2. King safety:
- White king is on g1, somewhat exposed
- Black king is on h4, active but vulnerable
3. Immediate threats:
- White's queen controls many squares but isn't directly threatening mate
- Black's g-pawn is advanced to g2, one move from promotion
- Black's h-pawn is on h2, potentially dangerous
4. Candidate moves:
- h4h5: Moves king away but doesn't help promotion
- h4g5: Gets king closer to g-pawn but exposes it
- h4g4: Centralizes king but still not helping promotion
- h4h3: Gets king closer to action but risky
- h4g3: Blocks g-pawn (bad)
- h2h3: Advances pawn but loses h2 control
- h2h1=Q: Promotes but allows Qxh1
- g6g5: Advances other pawn but slow
5. Best option:
The most forcing move is h2h1=Q, promoting the pawn. After Qxh1, we can play g2g1=Q, sacrificing the new queen to promote the g-pawn. The sequence would be:
1... h2h1=Q
2. Qxh1 g2g1=Q+
3. Kxg1 and we've eliminated White's queen, reaching a drawn knight vs king endgame.
This is the only way to force a draw, as other moves either don't help our promotion or allow White to consolidate their material advantage.

2025-06-22 01:59:41,091 - INFO - Attempt 2/5...
2025-06-22 01:59:56,151 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 15.06s):
Apologies for the oversight. Let me re-analyze the position with the correct legal moves:
Given legal moves: h4h5, h4g5, h4g4, h4h3, h4g3, h2h3, h2h1, g6g5
Key observations:
1. Our g-pawn is on g2, one move from promotion, but blocked by our own king if we play h4g3
2. The h-pawn is on h2 - advancing it to h3 or promoting to h1 are options
3. White's queen controls h1, so h2h1 would be immediately captured by Qxh1
4. White's knight can't stop our g-pawn's promotion next move if we don't block it
Best option is to advance the g-pawn to promotion while keeping our king safe:
1... g6g5 is too slow and doesn't help immediately
2... h4g3 blocks our own pawn (bad)
3... h2h3 advances but doesn't create immediate threats
4... h4h5/h4g5/h4g4 move king away from action
5... h2h1 allows Qxh1 but then g2g1=Q+ is possible
The most forcing line is:
1... h2h1 (allow Qxh1)
2. Qxh1 g2g1=Q+
3. Kxg1 and we reach a drawn knight vs king endgame
This is the only way to force a draw, despite losing the h-pawn immediately. Other moves either don't stop White from consolidating or block our own promotion.
