2025-06-20 18:19:28,145 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 19.34s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. The position is the standard starting position after White's first move e2-e4. As Black, we have many reasonable options here.
2. Key considerations:
- White has staked a claim in the center with e4
- We should aim to challenge or control the center
- Developing pieces is important
- We want to avoid weakening our position unnecessarily
3. Main candidate moves to consider:
- g8f6 (developing knight, attacking e4)
- e7e5 (symmetrical response, fighting for center)
- d7d5 (immediate challenge to e4)
- b8c6 (developing knight, supporting d5)
- g7g6 (preparing fianchetto)
4. Evaluating the top candidates:
- g8f6: Develops a piece, puts pressure on e4. But White can simply defend with d2-d3 or push e4-e5.
- e7e5: Directly challenges the center. Leads to open positions. Allows White to play Nf3 next.
- d7d5: Most direct challenge. Leads to open positions after exd5. Can be sharp.
- b8c6: Flexible, but doesn't immediately challenge e4.
5. Best choice:
e7e5 is the most principled response, directly challenging White's center control. It leads to classical open games and gives Black good chances for equality. It's also the most common and well-analyzed response at master level.
6. Other moves like g8f6 are also good, but e5 is more forcing and central.
After thorough consideration, the best move is:
```
e7e5
```

2025-06-20 18:20:28,968 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 14.05s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. The position is after 1.e4 e5 2.Bd3. White has developed their bishop to d3, controlling the central squares and eyeing the h7 pawn.
2. Black needs to respond carefully. The main strategic considerations are:
   - Developing pieces
   - Controlling the center
   - Preventing any immediate threats (like Bxh7 ideas)
   - Maintaining king safety
3. Looking at the candidate moves:
   - g8f6: Developing the knight to its most natural square, attacking e4
   - b8c6: Developing the other knight, supporting the e5 pawn
   - f8c5: Developing the bishop actively
   - d7d5: Countering in the center immediately
4. Evaluating these options:
   - g8f6 is tempting but after exf6 Qxf6, White gets a strong center
   - b8c6 is solid but doesn't challenge White's center
   - f8c5 looks active but can be met with Bxc5 dxc5, giving White a strong pawn center
   - d7d5 is the most principled response, immediately challenging White's center
5. d7d5 leads to:
   - exd5 Qxd5 (or Nf6)
   - Black gets active piece play and equalizes the center
   - It's the most dynamic and challenging response
6. Other moves like g7g6 or f7f5 weaken the kingside unnecessarily.
After careful consideration, the best move is to strike in the center immediately with:
```
d7d5
```

2025-06-20 18:21:44,933 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.77s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. The position is unusual - White has played e1-e2, moving the king early. This is generally not recommended as it weakens the castling rights.
2. Black has several reasonable options here. The key features:
   - White has a bishop on d3 pointing at Black's kingside
   - Black has a strong pawn center with pawns on e5 and d5
   - White's king is exposed on e2
3. Candidate moves to consider:
   - d5e4: Immediately challenging White's center by taking the pawn. However, after dxe4, White can recapture with the bishop, maintaining pressure.
   - g8f6: Developing the knight to its natural square, preparing to castle.
   - d8d6: Developing the queen while supporting the e5 pawn.
   - f8d6: Developing the bishop with tempo against the e5 pawn.
4. The most promising seems to be d5e4, as it:
   - Challenges White's center immediately
   - Opens lines for Black's pieces
   - Creates potential weaknesses around White's king
   - After 4. dxe4, Black can follow up with Qd6, putting pressure on e5 and preparing to castle
5. Other moves like Nf6 are also good, but dxe4 is more forcing and takes advantage of White's awkward king position.
After careful consideration, the best move is:
```
d5e4

2025-06-20 18:23:38,724 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 18.12s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. The position is quite unusual with White's king on e2 and Black having an advanced pawn on e4. White has just played f3 attacking the e4 pawn.
2. Black has several options to consider:
   - Defending the e4 pawn (e.g., e4f3, e4d3, e4e3)
   - Developing pieces (e.g., g8f6, b8c6, f8e7)
   - Counter-attacking (e.g., d8h4+)
3. Key observations:
   - White's king is exposed on e2
   - Black has a strong pawn on e4 that's under attack
   - White's dark-squared bishop is very active on d3
4. Best options:
   - e4f3 would trade pawns but give White the open f-file
   - e4d3 would sacrifice the pawn but open lines against the exposed king
   - Developing with g8f6 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threat
   - d8h4+ is tempting but after g2g3, Black doesn't have enough follow-up
5. The most promising move is e4d3!:
   - It sacrifices the pawn but opens the e-file against White's king
   - After c2d3, Black can play d8h4+ with strong threats
   - White's king will be very exposed and Black has active piece play
Here's the move:
```
e4d3
```

2025-06-20 18:24:40,542 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 20.89s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material is equal (both sides have lost a minor piece)
2. White's king is awkwardly placed on f1 after castling manually
3. Black has a strong passed pawn on d3 that's threatening to promote
4. White's pawn structure is compromised with doubled pawns on the d-file
5. Black has the initiative and should press the advantage
Key observations:
- The d3 pawn is very strong and should be supported
- White's king is vulnerable and we should look for attacking chances
- We need to prevent White from consolidating their position
Candidate moves to consider:
1. d3c2 - Pushing the pawn immediately, but after c2, White can play Qd1 attacking it
2. d8d4 - Centralizing the queen and supporting the pawn
3. g8f6 - Developing the knight with tempo on the e4 square
4. f8c5 - Developing the bishop with pressure on f2
After deeper analysis:
- d8d4 looks very strong, supporting the pawn and eyeing the h4-e1 diagonal
- White can't take the pawn (Qxd4?? exd4 and we win a queen)
- After d8d4, threats include ...Qh4+ or ...Bc5 putting more pressure
- The queen is also eyeing potential checks on the a1-h8 diagonal
Best move is to centralize the queen and maintain pressure:
```
d8d4
```

2025-06-20 18:25:53,082 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 22.12s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material: Both sides have equal material (1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights each). Black has a pawn on d3 vs White's pawn on h4.
2. King safety: White's king is on f1, somewhat exposed. Black's king is still on e8, not castled yet.
3. Key features:
   - Black's queen is very active on d4, attacking multiple squares
   - White's pawn structure is compromised with doubled pawns on d-file
   - Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could become dangerous
   - White's h4 pawn is weak and could be a target
4. Candidate moves to consider:
   - d4h4: Capturing the weak pawn immediately
   - d4e4: Centralizing the queen more
   - d3c2: Advancing the passed pawn with tempo
   - g8f6: Developing the knight to a natural square
   - f8d6: Developing the bishop with pressure
After careful consideration:
- d4h4 seems tempting but after Qxh4, White can play Nxh4 and we lose our active queen
- d3c2 is strong as it attacks the bishop and forces White to deal with the passed pawn
- g8f6 is solid development but doesn't take advantage of our current initiative
- f8d6 develops but doesn't create immediate threats
The best move is d3c2, advancing the passed pawn with tempo against White's bishop. This forces White to deal with the pawn immediately while maintaining our active queen's position.

d3c2

2025-06-20 18:26:29,583 - INFO - Raw response from Black (deepseek-v3) (took 13.22s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:
1. Material count: Black is up a pawn (sacrificed c2 pawn for initiative)
2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f1 with weak pawn structure
3. Key threats:
   - Black's queen is very active on d4
   - c2 pawn is about to promote (multiple promotion options)
   - White's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated
Critical observations:
- White's knight on h3 is loose and could be captured by Qxh4
- The c2 pawn can promote in multiple ways
- Black has the initiative and should maintain pressure
Candidate moves to consider:
1. Qxh4 - Wins a pawn but allows White to consolidate
2. c2b1q - Immediate promotion with check
3. c2d1q - Promotion with discovered attack on the rook
4. Qd8+ - Forcing the king to move and then promoting
After careful consideration:
- Qxh4 is tempting but gives White time to defend
- c2b1q+ forces Kf1-e1, then we can play Qd2 with strong pressure
- c2d1q is even better as it attacks the rook immediately and maintains more options
The best move is c2d1q, promoting to a queen with discovered attack on the rook. This maintains maximum pressure and initiative while gaining material.
