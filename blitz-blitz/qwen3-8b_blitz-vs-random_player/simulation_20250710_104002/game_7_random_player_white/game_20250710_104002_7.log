2025-07-10 13:06:24,502 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b_blitz) (took 25.21s):
To determine the best move, let's analyze the current position and the available legal moves. The FEN notation is:

```
rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/5PQ1/2P5/P2PP2P/6P1/RP1N1K1N/3R2B1 b - - 6 43
```

This indicates that it's Black's turn to move, and the position is in the middle game. Let's break down the position:

- Black has a strong pawn structure with pawns on e7, d6, and c5.
- The queen is on d8, and the rook is on d7.
- The knight on g8 is a key piece, and the bishop on c1 is active.
- White has a pawn on d4, and the queen is on d5.
- The position is somewhat balanced, but Black has some initiative due to the strong pawn structure and the active rook and knight.

Now, let's evaluate the legal moves:

- **g8h6**: Moves the knight to h6, which is a natural square for it and supports the pawn on g7.
- **g8f6**: Moves the knight to f6, which is a strong square and supports the pawn on e5.
- **f8g7**: Moves the bishop to g7, which is a strong square and supports the pawn on e5.
- **f8h6**: Moves the bishop to h6, which is a strong square and supports the pawn on g7.
- **e8d7**: Moves the rook to d7, which is already occupied by the rook, so this is not a legal move.
- **d8d7**: Moves the rook to d7, which is already occupied by the rook, so this is not a legal move.
- **d8d6**: Moves the rook to d6, which is a good square for the rook and supports the pawn on e5.
- **d8d5**: Moves the rook to d5, which is a good square for the rook and supports the pawn on e5.
- **d8d4**: Moves the rook to d4, which is a good square for the rook and supports the pawn on e5.
- **c8d7**: Moves the bishop to d7, which is a good square for the bishop and supports the pawn on e5.
- **c8e6**: Moves the bishop to e6, which is a good square for the bishop and supports the pawn on e5.
- **c8f5**: Moves the bishop to f5, which is a good square for the bishop and supports the pawn on e5.
- **c8g4**: Moves the bishop to g4, which is a good square for the bishop and supports the pawn on e5.
- **c8h3**: Moves the bishop to h3, which is a good square for the bishop and supports the pawn on e5.
- **b8d7**: Moves the knight to d7, which is a good square for the knight and supports the pawn on e5.
- **b8c6**: Moves the knight to c6, which is a good square for the knight and supports the pawn on e5.
- **b8a6**: Moves the knight to a6, which is a good square for the knight and supports the pawn on e5.
- **h7g6**: Moves the pawn to g6, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **f7g6**: Moves the pawn to g6, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **e7f6**: Moves the pawn to f6, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **h7h6**: Moves the pawn to h6, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **e7e6**: Moves the pawn to e6, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **c7c6**: Moves the pawn to c6, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **b7b6**: Moves the pawn to b6, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **a7a6**: Moves the pawn to a6, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **h7h5**: Moves the pawn to h5, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **e7e5**: Moves the pawn to e5, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **b7b5**: Moves the pawn to b5, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.
- **a7a5**: Moves the pawn to a5, which is a good square for the pawn and supports the knight on g8.

From this analysis, the best move is **g8f6**, which moves the knight to f6, a strong square that supports the pawn on e5 and prepares for further development. This move also threatens to develop the queen and rook, and it is a natural continuation of the game.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.

When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
