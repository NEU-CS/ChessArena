When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.

```
<move>
```

For example:
```

2025-07-10 11:54:48,113 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b_blitz) (took 15.22s):
To determine the best move, let's analyze the current position carefully.

### Position Analysis:
- **White to move**.
- **Material**: White has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, and pawns. Black has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and pawns.
- **Key pieces**:
  - **White's queen** is on **e1**, which is a strong central square.
  - **Black's queen** is on **e7**, which is a central square but slightly weakened due to the lack of support.
  - **Black's rook** on **g8** is a key piece that can be targeted.
  - **White's pawns** are well-advanced on the kingside, especially on **g2**, **f2**, and **e5**.
  - **Black's pawns** are more static and less advanced.

### Strategic Considerations:
- White has a strong initiative and a central presence.
- The **Black rook on g8** is a key target. It is not well-protected and can be attacked or captured.
- The **Black queen on e7** is also vulnerable due to the lack of support.
- White's **pawns on the kingside** are well-placed and can support an attack.
- The **Black king** is in the center, which is not ideal for a king in the endgame.

### Tactical Considerations:
- The **Black rook on g8** is the most vulnerable piece. It can be attacked or captured.
- The **Black queen on e7** is also a target, but it is more difficult to attack directly.
- White has several options to attack the Black rook on g8:
  - **g8h7** (moves the rook to h7, which is a strong square but not ideal for a rook).
  - **g8f7** (moves the rook to f7, which is a strong square but again not ideal for a rook).
  - **g8e6** (moves the rook to e6, which is a central square and could be useful).
  - **g8d5** (moves the rook to d5, which is a central square and could be useful).
  - **g8c4** (moves the rook to c4, which is a strong square for a rook).
  - **g8b3** (moves the rook to b3, which is a strong square for a rook).
  - **g8h7**, **g8f7**, **g8e6**, **g8d5**, **g8c4**, **g8b3** are all viable moves for the rook, but **g8c4** and **g8b3** are the most promising for long-term play.

### Best Move:
- The **Black rook on g8** is the most vulnerable piece and can be attacked or captured.
- The **best move** is to **attack the rook on g8** and force it to move to a less optimal square.
- The **move g8c4** is the best choice because it attacks the rook and forces it to move to a less optimal square.

### Final Move:
```
g8c4
```
