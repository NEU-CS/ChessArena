2025-06-23 04:50:14,885 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 11.22s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully:

### FEN:
`rn4nQ/p1p5/4k1p1/1p3p2/8/2b5/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 1 13`

### Material:
- **White** has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and pawns.
- **Black** is up a bishop and two minor pieces (knight and knight or bishop), but is very cramped.

### King Safety:
- White’s king is in the center but not immediately under threat.
- Black’s king is also in the center but more exposed and potentially vulnerable.

### Tactical Observations:
- White has a powerful queen on h8, which is currently attacking deep into Black’s position.
- Black has a dangerous-looking bishop on c3, threatening the White queen.
- The key move here is whether to capture the bishop with Qxc3, or retreat the queen or develop first.

### Candidate Moves:
1. `h8c3` – Capturing the bishop.
2. `e1e2` – Central king safety, developing the king away from the center.
3. `e1d1` – Castling long, connecting rooks and improving king safety.
4. `b1c3` – Developing the knight, supporting central control.
5. `b1d2` – Developing the knight with support for e4 or c4.
6. `c1d2` – Developing the bishop, protecting the queen indirectly.
7. `b2c3` – Supporting the bishop on c3, but pawn move may be slow.

### Evaluation:
- Taking the bishop (`h8c3`) seems forced because it removes a key attacker against your king and gains material back.
- After `h8c3`, Black loses a key piece and White regains some material while removing a major threat.
- This move opens up lines for White’s other pieces to exert pressure, especially along the back rank and central files.

### Plan:
After `h8c3`, White should follow up with development (`b1c3`, `b1d2`, `c1d2`, etc.) and prepare for a potential kingside attack.

### Best Move:
```
h8c3
```

When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```

2025-06-23 05:03:35,686 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 14.29s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully and determine the best move.

---

### **FEN Position:**
`1n6/8/p1p2rp1/8/1pB1k3/8/PPPK3P/RNB3Nn w - - 8 37`

We are playing as White. The material is roughly balanced, but there are several tactical and positional considerations:

- White has a bishop on c4, which is currently targeting e4 (occupied by Black's king).
- Black has a rook on f6 and a rook on g6 — both are active.
- Black’s king is in the center on e4, somewhat exposed.
- Black also has a knight on b8 (just developed) and a knight on h1 (trapped in the corner).
- White has a rook on a1, a knight on b1 (undeveloped), a knight on g1, and a king on d2.
- Pawns are scattered; White has doubled pawns on the c-file and a weak d-pawn.

---

### **Key Observations:**

1. **Black's King is Exposed:** The black king is on e4, vulnerable to checks and threats. This is a major tactical opportunity.
2. **White's Bishop on c4:** It can deliver check on multiple squares around the black king.
3. **Tactical Possibility:** `c4xf7+` would give check and capture a rook if not properly defended.
4. **Check of Opportunity:** `c4xf7+` is a strong candidate because:
   - It attacks the rook on f6.
   - It gives check to the black king.
   - If Black captures with the king (`e4xf7`), then White can play `d2-e2+`, forking the king and possibly winning material or accelerating an attack.

Let’s evaluate this line more deeply:

---

### **Candidate Move: `c4xf7+`**

#### After `c4xf7+`:
- Black must respond. Possible replies:
  - `Rxf7` — Best move
    - Then White gains a rook for a bishop — excellent trade!
    - Also opens up lines for White’s queen-side pieces.
    - Follow-up could be `Kd2-e3`, centralizing the king and threatening further.
  - `Ke4xf7` — worse for Black
    - Then `d2-e2+` forks king and knight/hole in Black's position.
    - Gaining material or creating a decisive advantage.

So regardless of how Black responds, `c4xf7+` is a forcing and advantageous move.

---

### **Conclusion:**

The move `c4xf7+` is tactically sound, forces Black into a defensive posture, and likely wins material. It exploits the exposed black king and creates immediate pressure.

2025-06-23 05:06:07,928 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 19.04s):
Let's begin with a detailed analysis of the position:

### FEN: `1n4B1/8/p1p2rp1/8/4k3/1p4n1/PPPK3P/RNB3N1 w - - 2 39`

We are playing as **White**, and it is our turn to move.

---

### Material Evaluation:
- **White** has: Rook, Bishop (light-squared), Knight, two pawns (a2, b2), and King.
- **Black** has: Rook, Knight, Bishop, two pawns (a6, c6), and King.
- White has an extra bishop for a pawn. The material balance slightly favors White.

---

### Positional Observations:
- **White’s king** is on d2 — somewhat centralized but not fully safe yet.
- **Black’s king** is dangerously advanced in the center at e4.
- Black has a rook on f6 and knight on g3 — both active and potentially dangerous near the White king.
- White has a powerful light-squared bishop on g8 that could become very active if lines open up.
- There is a pin along the g-file: White's bishop on g8 is pointing directly at the black rook on f6.
- Black has a passed b-pawn on b3, which is a threat if not contained.
- White’s pieces are relatively undeveloped or passive (e.g., knight on g1, bishop on c1).
- White must act quickly before Black consolidates and pushes their passed pawns or activates their king.

---

### Candidate Moves:
Let’s evaluate the most promising options:

#### 1. **g8h7** – Bishop to h7
- This removes the bishop from g8 and places it on h7.
- It threatens the rook on f6, forcing it to move.
- Also opens up potential ideas with the rook on a1 and bishop on h7 if the f-file opens.
- Strong tactical idea.

#### 2. **g8f7** – Bishop to f7
- Less aggressive than Bh7.
- Doesn’t threaten anything immediately.
- Might be useful later, but lacks urgency.

#### 3. **g8e6** – Bishop to e6
- Eyes the black king and supports possible central play.
- Could help in controlling squares around the black king.
- Still less immediate impact than Bh7.

#### 4. **d2c3** – King to c3
- Centralizes the king and supports the b2 pawn.
- But exposes the king to potential counterplay from Black’s king or rook.

#### 5. **b1c3** – Knight to c3
- Develops a piece.
- Supports the d-pawn and prepares for queenside activity.
- Too slow given the urgency of the position.

#### 6. **g1e2** – Knight to e2
- Develops the knight to a more flexible square.
- Not particularly urgent or threatening.

---

### Tactical Focus:
The key tactical motif here is the **pin along the g-file**. With the bishop on g8, we can exploit this by moving it to **h7**, attacking the rook on f6 and threatening to win material or create a discovered attack if the rook moves.

If Black moves the rook, we may get a discovered attack on the king or another piece depending on how the board unfolds.

Also, after **g8h7**, if Black plays ...Rxf6, then **Bxf6** gives us a strong initiative with the bishop now active and targeting the black king.

---

### Conclusion:
The best move is **g8h7**, exploiting the pin and creating immediate pressure on the black rook while activating the bishop.

Let's analyze the current position carefully:

### FEN:
`1n6/7B/p1p2rp1/8/4k3/1p6/PPPK3P/RNB2nN1 w - - 4 40`

### Move history:
- e2d2 (White played d2, moving a pawn)
- f7f6 (Black pushed f6)
- f1c4 (White developed bishop to c4)
- d4e4 (White king moved to e4)
- c4f7 (White bishop captured on f7)
- b4b3 (Black pushed b-pawn)
- f7g8 (White king took on g8)
- h1g3 (Black knight moved)
- g8h7 (White king moved again)
- g3f1 (Black knight to f1)

Now we are at move 40 and White has only four legal moves:
- `d2c3`
- `d2e2`
- `d2e1`
- `d2d1`

Let’s evaluate each move.

---

## Positional Understanding

White has a **very exposed king** on h7. Black has a rook on g6, which is eyeing the open g-file and the white king. Black also has a knight on f1, which could become dangerous if given time. Black's king is in the center but quite active at e4. Black has two connected passed pawns on the queenside: a6 and b3. The b3-pawn is especially advanced and dangerous.

White's material is clearly ahead (up a rook for a minor piece), but the **king safety** is poor, and the black pawns are advancing.

The key danger is that if White doesn't improve king safety or stop the b3-pawn, Black may promote it and win the game.

Currently, the d2-pawn is pinned by the black rook on g6 along the open g-file and semi-open d-file. Moving the d2-pawn will lift the pin and allow White to possibly centralize the king or support the queenside.

---

## Candidate Moves Evaluation

### 1. `d2c3` – Capturing on c3
This removes the pawn from d2 and opens up the d-file further. It also connects with the b2-pawn, creating a potential pawn chain. However, this move weakens the c3-square and gives Black more freedom around the center.

### 2. `d2e2` – Moving forward
This keeps the pawn structure intact and maintains the pin on the file. But it doesn’t help much in terms of freeing up space or improving king safety.

### 3. `d2e1` – Underpromotion?
This would be bizarre unless promoting to a piece helps somehow. Not useful here.

### 4. `d2d1` – Promoting the pawn
This is the most interesting option. Since the pawn is on d2 and supported by the king on h7, promoting on d1 makes sense. Promotion options:
- Queen (`d2d1q`) – Strongest choice.
- Rook/Knight/Bishop – Less effective.

Promoting to queen immediately adds a new heavy piece into the fray. This can help control critical squares like a4, d4, and potentially threaten mate.

After `d2d1q`, White gains a queen, which can dominate the dark squares and help contain the b3-pawn. It also threatens ideas like Qa4+ or Qxc6, picking off Black's queenside pawns.

---

## Best Move

Given the urgency of the situation and the need to stop Black's queenside pawns while maximizing White's material advantage, **promoting the pawn to a queen with `d2d1q` is the strongest and most decisive move.**

It transforms the position instantly in White's favor and allows for both attacking chances and defense against Black's threats.

```
d2d1q
```
2025-06-23 05:07:09,600 - WARNING - Illegal move: d2d1q is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one. Note that we have give you all legal moves.
2025-06-23 05:07:09,600 - INFO - Attempt 2/5...
2025-06-23 05:07:24,136 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 14.54s):
Apologies for the oversight. Let's re-evaluate carefully based on the **legal moves** provided:

### Legal Moves:
- `d2c3`
- `d2e2`
- `d2e1`
- `d2d1`

We previously suggested `d2d1q`, which is invalid because a pawn cannot promote unless it reaches the 8th rank — and d2 is still on the 2nd rank.

Let’s reassess each legal move properly.

---

## Position Recap

- **White king is dangerously exposed** on h7.
- Black has a rook on g6, eyeing the g-file and potentially threatening mate on g2 or g1 if not careful.
- Black also has a knight on f1, which could become active.
- Black's king is centralized at e4, very active.
- Black has dangerous passed pawns on the queenside: a6 and b3 (especially b3).
- White's only mobile unit is the d2-pawn; all other pieces are blocked or captured.

The d2-pawn is currently **pinned** by the black rook along the semi-open d-file.

Our goal must be to:
1. Improve king safety
2. Stop the b3-pawn from promoting
3. Possibly centralize the king or create counterplay

---

## Move Evaluation

### 1. `d2c3` – Capture on c3
This unpins the pawn and connects with the b2-pawn, forming a solid structure. It removes the pin and gives White a more flexible pawn setup. Also opens the d-file, possibly helping the king escape toward the center.

**Pros:**
- Unpins the pawn
- Connects pawns
- Opens lines for king escape

**Cons:**
- Doesn't directly stop b3
- Slightly weakens c3

### 2. `d2e2` – Advance forward
Keeps the pawn on the same file, maintains tension. Does little to improve king safety or unpin.

**Pros:**
- Keeps tension
- Simple development

**Cons:**
- No real progress
- Still pinned by rook

### 3. `d2e1` – Underpromotion?
Moving to e1 would allow king movement, but e1 is a poor square for a pawn. This is likely just losing time.

**Pros:**
- None apparent

**Cons:**
- Poor positioning
- Wastes tempo

### 4. `d2d1` – Promote
Pawn can’t promote here — still on 2nd rank. Promotion is illegal.

---

## Best Move

Given all this, the best move is:

```
d2c3
```

It breaks the pin, improves pawn structure, and gives White chances to maneuver the king away from danger. It also helps control the queenside and may allow White to later support the b2 pawn or challenge Black's advanced b3.

```
d2c3
```

2025-06-23 05:08:31,827 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 19.16s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully and choose the best move.

### FEN:
`1n6/7B/p1p3p1/5r2/4k3/1pK5/PPP4P/RNB2nN1 w - - 6 41`

### Move history:
- f1c4  
- d4e4  
- c4f7  
- b4b3  
- f7g8  
- h1g3  
- g8h7  
- g3f1  
- d2c3  
- f6f5  

We can see that both sides have sacrificed material for tactical or positional compensation. White has a bishop on h7, which is currently pinning something (we'll explore that), and Black has advanced pawns in the center and on the queenside.

### Current Position Summary:

**White:**
- King on c3
- Rook on a1
- Knight on b1, g1
- Bishop on h7
- Pawns on a2, b2, c2, h2

**Black:**
- King on e4
- Rook on f5
- Knight on f1, b8
- Pawns on a6, c6, b3, g6

Key observations:
- Black king is very far advanced and exposed.
- White’s king is also quite active but safer.
- The white bishop on h7 is eyeing the black king along the long diagonal.
- There is a potential discovered attack with the rook on a1 if the knight moves.
- b3 is a hanging pawn for Black under pressure from c3.
- Black has a knight on b8 (undeveloped) and one on f1 (trapped?).
- Black rook on f5 is active.

### Candidate Moves:

#### 1. **h7g8** – Moving the bishop to promote a potential discovered check or threat.
#### 2. **h7g6** – Attacking the g6 pawn and threatening mate ideas.
#### 3. **c3c4** – Defending the pawn on b3 and centralizing.
#### 4. **c3b4** – Possibly overextending.
#### 5. **c3b3** – Capturing the pawn, but may not be best.
#### 6. **g1h3**, **g1f3**, **g1e2** – Developing knights.
#### 7. **c1h6**, **c1g5**, **c1f4**, etc. – Moving the bishop.
#### 8. **b1a3**, **b1d2** – Developing knights.
#### 9. **c2b3** – Capturing the pawn.
#### 10. **a2b3** – Same as above.

---

### Tactical Focus:

The most promising idea lies in exploiting the **pin along the long diagonal** and the **exposed black king**.

After **1. Bg6!**, we threaten:
- Immediate check via Re1+ followed by Bh7+ or Bxf5+ depending on response.
- Mate threats are real due to the exposed black king.

Let’s examine this line more closely:

#### 1. h7g6

This threatens:
- Immediate Re1+ Kd5 Rd1+ K moves Bxf5#
- Or other forced lines leading to mate or massive material gain.

It’s a quiet but powerful move preparing for a mating net.

---

### Evaluation:

- **h7g6** is the strongest move here.
- It prepares for a discovered attack and possible mate.
- It keeps the initiative and doesn't allow Black to consolidate.

---

### Final Move:
```
h7g6
```

2025-06-23 05:09:00,442 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 9.34s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`1n6/8/p5B1/2p2r2/4k3/1pK5/PPP4P/RNB2nN1 w - - 0 42`

### Material:
- **White** has: Rook, Bishop (on g6), Knight, two pawns (a2, b2, c2 still on board)
- **Black** has: Two knights (on b8 and f1), a rook (f5), three pawns (a6, b3, c5), and king in the center (e4)

### Evaluation:
- Black’s king is very exposed in the center.
- White has a bishop currently pinning something and placed actively on g6.
- The black rook on f5 is vulnerable to tactics involving the white bishop.
- Black’s pieces are not well coordinated. Knights on the rim (b8 and f1) are poor.
- White has a significant opportunity for a tactical blow here.

### Candidate Moves:
- `g6xf5+`: This checks the king directly and removes the only active black piece.
    - After `Kxf5`, White can play `Bd2` or `Nd2` with a strong initiative.
- `g6-h5`: Keeps pressure but less aggressive.
- `g6-e8`: Might be a mistake as it allows Black to regroup.
- Other moves like `c3-c4`, `c3-b3`, etc., are positional but miss the immediate tactical opportunity.

### Tactical Insight:
The key move is `g6xf5+`. It removes a key defender and opens up lines while forcing the black king into a vulnerable position.

### Best Move:
```
g6xf5
```

2025-06-23 05:11:20,162 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 14.55s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/3B4/p1n5/2pk4/8/1p1K4/PPP1n2P/RNB3N1 w - - 7 46`

### Move History:
- h7g6  
- c6c5  
- g6f5  
- e4d5  
- f5c8  
- f1g3  
- c8d7  
- g3e2  
- c3d3  
- b8c6  

We are at move 46, and White is to move.

### Material Balance:
- **White** has: 1 bishop (d7), 1 knight (g1), 1 king, pawns on a2, b2, c2, h2
- **Black** has: 2 knights (c6, e2), 1 pawn (a6, b3, d5, c5), king on d5

Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces and dangerous central pawns. The key danger for White is that Black’s king and pawns are more centralized and advanced.

### Positional Assessment:
- White’s bishop on d7 is currently blocking all the action behind it.
- The white king is in the center, but not under immediate threat.
- Black’s king is also in the center, with pawns on d5 and c5 — these could become dangerous if not contained.
- Black’s knight on e2 is threatening to infiltrate or support further action.
- Black has a passed pawn on b3 which is close to queening.
- White’s best plan is likely to simplify the position, neutralize threats, and possibly push the queenside pawns.

### Candidate Moves:
1. **d3-e3** – Activates the king, supports c2-c4 or b2-b3.
2. **d3-e2** – Centralizes the king, helps control the board.
3. **d7-e6** – Aims to exchange off the dangerous knight on c6.
4. **d7-c6** – Captures a knight, simplifies the position.
5. **g1-f3** – Develops the knight actively.
6. **c2-c4** – Restricts black’s central pawns.

### Tactical Insight:
The most forcing move is **d7xc6**, removing one of Black’s active knights and reducing counterplay. After:

- 1. d7xc6 Kxc6
- Then White can play **Kc3**, supporting the c4 break or pushing pawns.

This exchange removes an active piece from Black and simplifies the position. It also prevents the knight from jumping to strong squares like b4 or d4.

### Evaluation:
Capturing on c6 is safe and improves White’s chances by reducing Black’s activity. It also opens lines for White’s king to get more involved.

### ✅ Best Move:
```
d7c6

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/8/p1k5/2p5/8/1p1K4/PPP1n2P/RNB3N1 w - - 0 47`

### Move history:
- g6f5, e4d5  
- f5c8, f1g3  
- c8d7, g3e2  
- c3d3, b8c6  
- d7c6, d5c6  

We can reconstruct a rough board state. White has a king on d3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, and others, with scattered pieces. Black has a knight on e2 (possibly just captured something), and is up material, but appears to be weak in king safety.

### Current Position Summary:

**White:**
- King on d3
- Rook on a1
- Knight on b1
- Bishop on c1
- Pawns on a2, b2, c2, h2

**Black:**
- King on c6
- Knight on e2
- Pawns on a6, b3, c5

This seems like a late middle-game or early endgame. Black has advanced pawns on the queenside but their king is quite exposed in the center. White still has most of the army intact and a centralized king.

### Tactical Observations:

- The black king is dangerously placed on **c6**, which is very central and vulnerable.
- White has a **knight on b1** that could jump into active squares.
- The white bishop on **c1** is currently blocked by its own pawns but could become active if lines open.
- The white rook on **a1** is semi-passive; it could support an invasion or help push queenside pawns.
- The white king is active on **d3**, supporting potential pawn advances.
- Black’s knight on **e2** is not immediately dangerous.
- Black has a passed pawn on **b3**, but it's far from queening.

### Strategy:

Given the exposed black king and White’s active king and minor pieces, there may be a tactical sequence to exploit this.

The key idea is to **pressure the c-file and 6th rank**, especially since the black king is on **c6**.

A good candidate move is:

### `d3e4`

This move:
- Centralizes the king to **e4**, where it supports both kingside and queenside action.
- Opens diagonals for the bishop (e.g., Bg5+).
- Prepares to bring the knight into strong squares like **d5** or **f5**.
- Keeps pressure on the center and threatens quick follow-ups.

It avoids weakening any critical squares and gives maximum flexibility for White’s next moves.

d3e4

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/8/p1k5/2p5/4K3/8/pPP1n2P/RNB3N1 w - - 0 48`

### Board Position:
```

. . . . K . . .

```

White to move.

### Observations:

- **Material is roughly equal**, but White has more active pieces and better king positioning.
- Black has a knight (on e2) that is somewhat trapped or at least in danger if White can close off escape squares.
- The Black king is exposed in the center, and with precise play, White may be able to launch a decisive attack.
- White’s king on e4 is quite active and can support an initiative.
- Black has pawns on a2 and a6, but they are not immediate threats.
- The most important piece for White is likely the **light-squared bishop** which can target the long diagonal and help restrict the knight on e2.
- Candidate moves should focus on **limiting the knight’s mobility**, **activating the bishop**, and **pressuring the black king**.

---

### Candidate Moves:

1. **Bd2** – Develops the bishop actively, eyes the a5-e1 diagonal, and prepares to pressure the knight on e2.
2. **Be3** – Also develops the bishop with ideas of trapping the knight or preparing Rh1 followed by Qh5+ ideas.
3. **Ke3** – Centralizes the king further, supports potential pawn advances and pressures the center.
4. **Kd3** – Another king centralization idea, also threatening to cut off the knight's escape.
5. **Kf3** – Supports h2-h4 and opens lines for rook activation.
6. **Rh1** – Prepares to double on the h-file or bring in the rook into the attack.

---

### Tactical Insight:

The key tactical point is the **knight on e2**, which is currently limited in mobility. If we can cut off its escape routes, it might be lost or severely weaken Black's position.

Let’s look at **Bd2**:

- It develops the bishop to a strong diagonal.
- It threatens to follow up with **Kd3** or **Ke3**, boxing in the knight.
- After **...Nd4**, **c3** could trap the knight.
- This move sets up a sequence that limits Black’s counterplay and builds pressure.

---

### Evaluation:

- **Bd2** is the best developing move with clear follow-ups.
- It improves White’s position without risk.
- It prepares for multiple continuations depending on Black’s reply.

---

### Final Move:

---

## 🧠 Positional Understanding:

White has a king on e4, a bishop on d2, pawns on b2, c2, and h2. There are two knights: one on b1 and one on g1. Black has a king on c6, a knight on c3 (attacking e4), and advanced passed pawns on a2 and a6. Black also has a pawn on c5.

Black’s passed pawns are dangerous — especially a2, which is very close to queening. However, Black’s king is somewhat exposed in the center, and White has active pieces that can coordinate quickly.

The key tactical point is **the knight on c3**, which is currently attacking the e4 square. White must deal with this threat or exploit it.

---

## 🔍 Candidate Moves Analysis:

### 1. **e4f5** – Knight retreats to f5.
- This removes the attacked piece from e4.
- f5 is a decent square; knight eyes g7 and controls e7/d6.
- Keeps pressure on the center.

### 2. **e4e5** – Knight advances to e5.
- Central control improves.
- Knight becomes more active.
- Not under attack here.
- Good outpost.

### 3. **e4f4** – Knight to f4.
- Very aggressive; threatens g6, controls e6/h6.
- Might be too speculative.

### 4. **e4f3** – Knight to f3.
- Develops toward kingside.
- Somewhat passive compared to other options.

### 5. **e4e3** – Knight to e3.
- Defends c2 and b2 pawns.
- Supports d5 square.
- Passive but safe.

### 6. **e4d3+** – Knight checks the black king!
- **This move stands out!**
- Forces the black king to move.
- Potentially disrupts Black’s coordination.
- Could lead to tactical opportunities.

Let’s explore this move further.

#### After `e4d3+`:
- Black king must move:
   - `c6b7`, `c6b6`, `c6d6`, or `c6c7`.

Each of these gives White a tempo advantage and potential follow-up ideas like `Rxa2`, `Nd5`, or `Ba5+`.

Also, note that after `e4d3+`, Black cannot take the knight immediately because the knight is protected by the bishop on d2.

So `e4d3+` is a **forcing move** that gains initiative.

---

## ✅ Final Evaluation:

Among all candidate moves, **`e4d3+`** is the most powerful. It creates immediate tension, forces the enemy king to move, and opens up tactical possibilities for White.

It’s not just a defensive reaction — it's an active, aggressive move that seizes control of the game at a critical moment.

2025-06-23 05:13:11,144 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 20.33s):
Let's begin with a thorough analysis of the position.

### FEN:
`8/8/pk6/2p5/8/2nK4/pPPB3P/RN4N1 w - - 4 50`

### Move history:
- c3d3, b8c6  
- d7c6, d5c6  
- d3e4, b3a2  
- c1d2, e2c3  
- e4d3, c6b6

We are at move 50. White has just completed some maneuvering in what seems like an endgame or near-endgame scenario.

### Current Position Summary:

**White:**
- King on d3
- Pawns on b2, c2, h2
- Bishop on d2
- Knights on b1 and g1
- Rook on a1

**Black:**
- King on b6
- Pawn on a6, a2 (passed and advanced)
- Knight on c3
- Pawns on c5

### Observations:

1. **Black has a dangerous passed pawn on a2**, one square away from queening. It must be dealt with immediately.
2. The black king is centralized around b6, but not extremely active yet.
3. Black also has a knight on c3, which is quite active and could threaten White’s king if not handled carefully.
4. White has limited mobility for most pieces, especially the rook on a1 and knights on b1/g1.
5. The bishop on d2 can potentially control key diagonals and may be used to stop the a-pawn.

### Immediate Threats:
- **Black's a2 pawn promotes in two moves unless stopped.**
- Black's knight on c3 threatens squares near the white king, such as b1 and d1.

### Plan:
- Stop the a2 pawn promotion.
- Use the bishop or king to intercept the pawn.
- Avoid allowing Black to promote with check.
- Try to centralize the king or activate other pieces to create counterplay.

---

### Candidate Moves:
Let’s evaluate the most relevant legal moves:

#### 1. `d2h6` – Bishop to h6
- Long diagonal, doesn’t help with stopping the pawn.
- Might be useful later, but not urgent now.

#### 2. `d2g5`, `d2f4`, `d2e3` – Bishop to various diagonals
- None directly target the a2 pawn.

#### 3. `d2c3` – Bishop captures knight
- Tempting, but after `a2a1q`, Black still promotes with tempo (check).
- Not safe enough.

#### 4. `d2e1`, `d2c1` – Retreating bishop
- Wastes time; no benefit.

#### 5. `d3c4` – King advances toward center
- Too slow. Doesn't address the immediate threat.

#### 6. `d3e3` – King to e3
- Could support bishop or prepare to intercept pawn on b-file.
- Still too slow.

#### 7. `d3c3` – King captures knight
- Then `a2a1q+`, king must move.
- Black gets queen with check, very dangerous.

#### 8. `a1a2` – Rook takes pawn
- After `a2xa2`, then `b1a3` or similar, but again, Black promotes next move.

#### 9. `b2b3` – Blocking the a-file
- This is promising!
- Stops the a2 pawn from promoting next move.
- Gives White time to respond.

Let’s analyze it more closely:

### Move: `b2b3`

- Blocks the path of the a2 pawn.
- Now Black cannot promote immediately.
- If Black plays `a2a1q`, then `b3xa4` captures the queen.
- Alternatively, White can use the bishop or king to intercept the pawn.

This move buys critical time and prevents an immediate loss.

---

### Final Evaluation:

The best move here is **`b2b3`**, which stops the dangerous passed pawn and gives White time to consolidate.

2025-06-23 05:13:37,533 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 13.45s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/8/1k6/p1p5/8/1PnK4/p1PB3P/RN4N1 w - - 0 51`

### Material:
- **White** has: 2 bishops, 2 knights, 1 rook, 3 pawns (b3, c2, h2)
- **Black** has: knight, 2 pawns (a2, a5), and a king

Material is roughly balanced, but White has more active pieces and better structure. Black’s only real threat is the advanced a2 pawn, which could promote soon if not stopped.

### Key Observations:
- Black’s king is centralized at b6.
- White’s king is on d3, also quite central.
- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on **a2**, which is one move from queening (`a2a1q`).
- The black knight on c3 is well-placed, potentially forking or supporting threats.
- White must act quickly to stop the a2 pawn before it promotes.

### Immediate Threat:
Black’s next move could be `a2a1q`, giving Black a queen. So White must either:
1. Capture the pawn first,
2. Prevent its promotion somehow, or
3. Deliver checkmate before Black can promote.

### Candidate Moves:
Let’s evaluate the most promising moves:

#### 1. `d2e1` – Bishop to e1, defending b4 square and preparing to control a5-e1 diagonal.
This keeps the bishop active and covers squares near the a-pawn.

#### 2. `d2e3` – Bishop to e3, attacking the black knight on c3.
This threatens to win material immediately.

#### 3. `d3c4` – King to c4, centralizing further and threatening to pick off pawns.
But this may be too slow.

#### 4. `b1c3` – Knight to c3, attacking the black pawn on c5 or supporting the center.
Not very effective here.

#### 5. `a1a2` – Rook captures on a2, stopping the pawn directly.
This is **very strong**: it removes the immediate promotion threat and gains material.

Let’s look closer at **`a1a2`**.

### Move: `a1a2` (Rook takes on a2)
- Stops the a2 pawn in its tracks.
- Gains a tempo advantage by removing Black’s main threat.
- After that, White can proceed with king support or bishop pressure.

This seems like the best move here — immediate, decisive, and stops the biggest danger.

### Evaluation:
- After `a1a2`, Black cannot promote the a-pawn.
- White retains full control and can maneuver for a win.
- No immediate counterplay from Black.

Let's analyze the current position carefully:

### FEN:
`8/8/1k6/p7/2p5/1PnK4/R1PB3P/1N4N1 w - - 0 52`

### Material:
- **White**: 2 pawns (b3, h2), Bishop (d2), Knight (b1, g1), Rook (a2)
- **Black**: 1 pawn (a5), 1 knight (c3), and king
- White has a material advantage of roughly a rook and pawn.

### Positional Observations:
- The black king is centralized but not particularly dangerous.
- Black’s knight on c3 is active and threatening to disrupt white’s structure or even create tactical threats.
- White’s king is quite active and well-placed near the center.
- White has a passed pawn on b3, supported by the king.
- There is a tension between the white bishop and black pawn on c4/d3.

### Tactical Considerations:
The key point of tension is on d3-c4. Black could play ...c3 to threaten the bishop and increase pressure. So White must resolve this tension carefully.

### Candidate Moves:
1. **d3d4** – Advances the pawn, defends the bishop, and creates a more solid structure.
2. **d3c4** – Captures the pawn, but exposes the bishop to possible counterplay from the black knight.
3. **d3e3** – Retreats the bishop, possibly preparing for a maneuver, but loses tempo.
4. **d3c3** – Captures the knight, but likely allows counterplay as black can recapture with the king and open lines.
5. **b3c4** – Pushes the pawn forward, opens lines, and supports the bishop.

### Evaluation:
- **d3c4** and **d3c3** are risky because they open up the position and give Black chances to activate counterplay.
- **d3e3** and **b3c4** are passive or less effective in pressing for a win.
- **d3d4!** looks like the best move: it strengthens the center, protects the bishop, limits Black’s options, and keeps the initiative firmly in White’s hands.

It also prepares potential plans like pushing the b-pawn or activating the rook on the open file after d4-d5.

### Final Move:

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN Position:
```
8/8/1k6/8/p1pK4/1Pn5/R1PB3P/1N4N1 w - - 0 53
```

We are playing as **White**. Let's understand the position:

- **Material**: Both sides are roughly equal in material.
    - White has: 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 1 Rook, and pawns.
    - Black has: Knight + pawns.
- **King Safety**: Both kings are relatively exposed, but White’s king is more active.
- **Key Tactical/Strategic Points**:
    - White has a centralized king on d4, which could be used aggressively.
    - The rook on a2 can become very dangerous if it gets activated along open files or ranks.
    - The bishop pair gives White long-range pressure potential.
    - Black has a knight on c3 (possibly overworked), and some pawn threats on the queenside (a4, c4).
    - White must prevent counterplay from Black, especially with ...c3 or ...a3.

### Candidate Moves:

1. **d4xc3** – Capturing the knight immediately removes a key defender for Black and eliminates any threat of ...c3.
2. **a2-a4** – Pushing the pawn to restrict Black’s play and support the b3 pawn.
3. **b3-b4** – Opening lines for the rook and creating space.
4. **g1-e2 / g1-f3 / b1-c3** – Developing knights to better squares.
5. **d2-h6 / d2-g5** – Long bishop moves to threaten something or control key diagonals.

Now let's evaluate each move deeply.

---

### Move: `d4xc3` (Capture on c3)

- **Pros**:
    - Removes a key Black piece (the knight on c3) that was eyeing tactical shots like ...Nb5 or supporting pawn breaks.
    - Eliminates any chance of ...c3 pushing forward.
    - Simplifies the position slightly in White’s favor.
- **Cons**:
    - Opens up the c-file; however, with no Black rooks, this is not an immediate issue.
    - Might allow ...a3 later, but White can still respond with bxa4 or prepare b4.

This move looks clean and strong. It removes a central threat and improves White’s control.

---

### Other Moves Evaluated:

- **a2-a4** – Useful to stop ...a3, but less urgent than removing the knight first.
- **b3-b4** – Could create space and activate the rook, but might be met with ...c3 first.
- **d2-h6** – Too speculative; no clear target.
- **g1-e2 / g1-f3** – Good developing moves, but secondary to removing the knight first.

---

### Conclusion:

The best move here is to **eliminate the knight on c3**, which is the most active piece Black has. This will simplify the position and reduce Black’s counterplay significantly.

2025-06-23 05:14:42,472 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 15.70s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/1k6/8/8/p1pK4/1P6/R1PB3P/1N4N1 w - - 3 55`

### Move history:
- b2b3 (a6a5)
- a1a2 (c5c4)
- d3d4 (a5a4)
- d4c4 (b6a6)
- d4d4 (a6b7)

Now it's White's 55th move.

---

## Positional Understanding:

White has:
- A centralized king on d4.
- Rook on a2, currently pinning the black pawn on a4 (which is blocked by a3).
- Bishop on d2 with several possible moves.
- Pawns on b3, c2, h2, g1, and b1 (minor pieces left).
- Black has advanced pawns on a4 and c4.

Black’s king is on b7. It's quite passive. Black has no active counterplay at the moment.

The key idea for White is to **centralize the bishop**, possibly prepare a kingside march or use the rook to infiltrate along the 7th rank if possible.

Also, note that Black's king is somewhat stuck in the center and can be targeted.

We should look for ways to increase pressure and avoid simplifications unless clearly winning.

---

## Candidate Moves:

### 1. **Bd2-c3** – This targets the c4 pawn and supports the d4 square. It also opens the a1-h8 diagonal slightly for potential future ideas.

### 2. **Ra2-a4** – Removes the rook from the pin and threatens the a4 pawn. Also prevents ...a3.

### 3. **Kd4-c5** – Marching the king forward into enemy territory. Could be dangerous but promising.

### 4. **Bd2-e3+** – Checking idea to push the black king back.

Let’s evaluate each:

---

### 1. **Bd2-c3**

This seems most logical. It pressures the c4 pawn, which is already under some stress. It also keeps options open for both king infiltration and rook activity.

If Black plays ...Kc6 later, White can consider Kc4 or Kd4-Kc5 plans.

Also, Bc3 gives the bishop more scope than before.

---

### 2. **Ra2-a4**

Also good, but less dynamic. It removes the rook from the pin and attacks the a4 pawn. However, after ...a3, Ra4 may have to retreat again.

---

### 3. **Kd4-c5**

Too risky? Black could play ...Ka6 and potentially activate their king. We want to keep Black’s king boxed in.

---

### 4. **Bd2-e3+**

Could force the black king back to b6 or b8, but might lead to exchanges that simplify things too early.

---

## Final Evaluation:

**Best move: Bd2-c3**  
It improves the bishop’s activity, pressures c4, and keeps the initiative without unnecessary risks.

`8/1k6/8/8/2pK4/1pB5/R1P4P/1N4N1 w - - 0 56`

### Move history:
- a1a2, c5c4, d3d4, a5a4, d4c3, b6a6, c3d4, a6b7, d2c3, a4b3

We are at move **56**, and it's **White to move**.

### Material:
- White has: 2 pawns (c2, h2), bishop (c3), rook (a2), two knights (b1, g1), king (d4)
- Black has: 2 pawns (b3, c4), king (b7)

Black has no active pieces left. His king is on b7, and his only pawns are on b3 and c4.

### Positional Assessment:
White has a material advantage (bishop + rook + knights vs. just pawns). The Black king is passive, and Black has no real counterplay unless White blunders.

The key idea for White is to centralize the king and push the passed pawns while coordinating the pieces.

### Immediate Threats:
No immediate threats from Black. He has no active pieces or meaningful play.

### Candidate Moves:

#### 1. **Rook moves:**
- **a2a8**: Invades the back rank. Not very useful since Black has no pieces.
- **a2a7+**: Checks the king. Could force it backward.
- **a2a6 / a2a5 / a2a4 / a2a3**: Pushing the rook forward to support pawn advances.
- **a2b2**: Connects with the king, supports c3, prepares to pick off the b3 pawn.

#### 2. **King moves:**
- **d4e5 / d4d5 / d4c5 / d4e4 / d4c4 / d4e3**: King can advance to support c4 or e5 squares.

#### 3. **Bishop moves:**
- **c3b4 / c3b2 / c3d2 / c3e1 / c3a1**: These are mostly repositioning moves; not urgent.

#### 4. **Knight moves:**
- **g1f3 / g1h3 / g1e2 / b1a3 / b1d2**: Minor piece maneuvering; not immediately decisive.

---

### Plan:
White should aim to:
1. Win the b3 pawn.
2. Use the rook and king to support the c2 pawn.
3. Centralize the king and coordinate all pieces toward pushing pawns.

Best way to start this plan is by playing **a2b2**, connecting the rook with the king, supporting the bishop, and preparing to take on b3.

This move also avoids unnecessary checks or premature pawn pushes that might allow Black to set up a fortress or stalemate ideas.

---

### Final Move:
```
a2b2

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`1k6/8/8/8/2pK4/1pB5/1RP4P/1N4N1 w - - 2 57`

### Material:
- **White** has: King, Bishop (c3), two Rooks (b2, c2), two Knights (b1, g1), and a pawn (h2)
- **Black** has: King, two pawns (b3, c4)

### Evaluation:
- White is up significantly in material.
- Black’s only pieces are two connected passed pawns on the queenside (b3 and c4), which are dangerous but not yet promoted.
- The black king is passive on b8.
- White has a centralized king on d4, which is quite active.
- The white bishop on c3 controls the diagonal toward the queenside and can help contain the pawns.
- White has multiple pieces that can coordinate to stop or capture the pawns.

### Goal:
White must prevent promotion of the black pawns and use superior material to win. The most urgent task is to stop the pawns.

### Candidate Moves:
We must consider moves that either:
- Block or attack the pawns
- Approach them with the king
- Use the bishop or rooks to cut off support

#### Let's evaluate some key candidates:

1. **d4e5** – King advances, keeps pressure on c4
2. **d4d5** – Pushes king forward, potentially cuts off escape squares for c4
3. **d4c5** – King captures the c4-pawn; risky if king gets stuck
4. **c3b4** – Bishop targets b3 pawn directly
5. **c2b3** – Rook captures b3 pawn immediately

Let’s go deeper.

---

### Tactical Insight:

If White plays **c2xb3**, capturing the b3-pawn immediately, then after **c4xb3**, the b2-Rook can now move to b1 and deliver check, gaining tempo while also helping contain the remaining pawn.

So:

1. **c2xb3** c4xb3  
2. **b2b1+** Ka8  
3. Now White can bring in the king and bishop to finish off the b3 pawn.

This seems clean and effective.

Also, note that **c3-b4** threatens the b3 pawn but allows it to advance potentially. It may be better to just take it.

---

### Best Move:

The clearest path to victory is to **capture the b3 pawn with the rook**, forcing Black to recapture with the c4-pawn, then follow up with a discovered check using the other rook.

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`k7/8/8/8/2pK4/1PB5/1R5P/1N4N1 w - - 1 58`

### Position Summary:
- **Material**: White has a bishop, two knights, and a pawn (h2), versus Black's lone c4-pawn.
- **King position**: White king is active at d4. Black's king is on a8 — passive and far from the action.
- **Black's only threat** is the advanced passed pawn on c4.
- **White can win** by advancing the h2-pawn to promote or maneuvering to capture the c4-pawn.
- The position seems like a technical win for White with precise play.

---

## Step-by-step Analysis:

### Goal:
Win the game by promoting the h2-pawn or eliminating Black’s counterplay (the c4-pawn). Since Black has no pieces left, their only hope is to use the c4-pawn effectively or get a draw via stalemate or insufficient material.

### Immediate Threats:
- Black’s c4-pawn is a passed pawn but currently not dangerous unless White makes a mistake.
- White must prevent ...c3 followed by ...c2 and ...c1=Q.

### Candidate Moves:
We'll evaluate each move based on how well it supports our goal of securing the win.

#### 1. **d4e5** – King moves forward; advances toward the center.
- Good: Centralizes the king.
- Bad: Doesn’t directly address the c4-pawn or support h2 advancement.
- Neutral.

#### 2. **d4d5** – King moves one step closer to c4.
- Good: Approaching the c4-pawn.
- Best: Helps in capturing the c4-pawn soon.
- Strong candidate.

#### 3. **d4c5** – King attacks the c4-pawn directly.
- **Very good**: Puts pressure on the c4-pawn immediately.
- If Black plays ...Ka7, then Kxc4 wins the pawn easily.
- After taking the pawn, White can focus on promoting h2.
- This is likely the best immediate move.

#### 4. **d4e4**, **d4c4**, **d4e3** – Other king moves.
- Less effective than d4c5 which targets the pawn directly.

#### 5. **c3a5**, **c3b4**, **c3d2**, **c3e1** – Knight moves.
- Risky: Might allow Black to push ...c3 and gain tempo.
- Not ideal unless there's a tactical reason.

#### 6. **b2g2**, **b2f2**, **b2e2**, **b2d2**, **b2c2**, **b2a2** – Rook moves.
- Useless: No useful squares for the rook. No files open or targets.

#### 7. **g1h3**, **g1f3**, **g1e2** – Knight moves.
- Ineffective: Knights are better used supporting pawn promotion or controlling key squares.

#### 8. **b1a3**, **b1d2** – Knight moves.
- Also ineffective here.

#### 9. **b3c4**, **b3b4** – Bishop moves.
- Bc4 is okay as a developing move, but doesn't help win.
- Bb4 might pin something, but nothing to pin.

#### 10. **h2h3**, **h2h4** – Pawn moves.
- Premature. Better once the path is clear.
- Can be played later after securing the center.

---

### Conclusion:
The most accurate and direct winning move is **d4c5**, targeting the c4-pawn immediately. It forces Black to respond and gives White control over the critical central squares.

2025-06-23 05:15:48,783 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 15.74s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`k7/8/8/2K5/8/1pB5/1R5P/1N4N1 w - - 0 59`

### Material:
- **White** has: King, Bishop (c3), Rook (b2), Knight (b1, g1)
- **Black** has: King and a single pawn on b3

### Positional Observations:
- White is up by a rook and knight for a pawn — a massive material advantage.
- Black’s only threat is the passed b-pawn, which is one square away from queening.
- The black king is in the corner (a8), but the b-pawn is dangerously advanced.
- White must be careful not to allow the b-pawn to promote with check or lead to stalemate tricks.
- The white king is on c5 — close to the action.
- The white bishop on c3 can control the critical queening square b2 if positioned correctly.
- The white rook on b2 is ideally placed to support the b-file, but currently pinned to defending against b3-b2+.

### Goal:
Prevent Black from queening the b-pawn while using White's overwhelming material to finish the game quickly.

---

### Candidate Moves:

#### 1. **c3xb3** – Capturing the pawn directly.
- Pros: Eliminates the immediate threat.
- Cons: Opens the possibility of stalemate if Black has no legal moves after this capture.

After `1. cxb3`, Black has no pawns left and if their king cannot move without being in check, it could result in a **stalemate**.

Let’s test that:
- After `1. cxb3 Kb7`, then White still has full mobility and can proceed.

So stalemate is avoidable **if handled properly**, but caution is needed.

#### 2. **c5d6 / c5c6 / c5b6** – King moves to approach and support promotion prevention
- These are slower than necessary and give Black time to push b3-b2.

#### 3. **c3e5 / c3d4 / c3b4** – Bishop moves to more active squares
- These don’t address the immediate danger of b3-b2.

#### 4. **b2g2 / b2f2 / b2e2** – Rook moves away from the b-file
- Dangerous! This would allow `...b2+` with a discovered attack on the king.

#### 5. **b2b3** – Most accurate!
- This **immediately stops** the b-pawn from advancing.
- It also **pins** the pawn to the rook, so Black cannot take it without losing the pawn.
- After `1. Rb2-b3`, Black must move the king.
- Then White can maneuver to win cleanly.

This move avoids any stalemate risk and keeps all winning chances intact.

---

### Final Evaluation:
The best move is to **play b2-b3**, stopping the pawn from queening and keeping full control over the position.

```

### Observations:

- **Material is equal**: White has a rook, two bishops, and a knight vs. Black’s king and pawn structure.
- **White's king is active** in the center (on c5), while Black's king is on a7.
- **Black's king is somewhat restricted**, with limited space to expand.
- **White has a passed h-pawn**, which could be promoted if advanced correctly.
- **The rook on b3** can become very dangerous if it can infiltrate deeper ranks or support a checkmate pattern.
- **Bishops are active**, especially the light-squared bishop controlling key diagonals.
- **Black has no immediate counterplay** — this is a critical moment to press for a win.

### Goal:
We must use the activity of our pieces to restrict Black’s king further and push the h-pawn, while coordinating our rook and minor pieces for a decisive attack.

### Candidate Moves:

1. **c5-d6** – Advances the king toward the kingside, supporting the h-pawn.
2. **h2-h4** – Starts advancing the h-pawn to promote.
3. **b3-b8+** – Sacrifices the rook to expose the black king.
4. **c3-e5** – Centralizing the bishop.
5. **g1-f3** – Developing the knight toward the center.

### Tactical Insight:

The move **b3-b8+** is extremely tempting. Let's explore it:

- After `b3b8`, Black must capture: `a7xb8`.
- Then we play **c5-d6**, attacking the black king and threatening mate.
- The king has nowhere to go. This may lead to a forced mate sequence.

Let's test that line:

1. `b3b8`: Kb8
2. `c5d6`: Kc7
3. `c3e5+`: Kd8
4. `b1d2`: ... and then likely `Rb3` or `Ba6`, continuing pressure.

Alternatively, after `b3b8 Kb8 c5d6 Kc8 Ba6+ Kd7 Rd3+` etc., White maintains a crushing advantage.

This line seems promising and forces Black into a corner.

### Best Move:

After evaluating all lines, **b3b8** is the most forcing and effective move. It sacrifices the rook but opens up the position for a mating net or decisive breakthrough.

2025-06-23 05:16:17,975 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 13.12s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`1k6/8/8/2K5/8/2B5/7P/1N4N1 w - - 0 61`

### Material:
- **White** has: King on c5, Bishop on c3, Knight on b1, Knight on g1, and a pawn on h2.
- **Black** has: King on b8 (and nothing else).

### Goal:
White wants to checkmate Black’s king or promote the h-pawn. Since Black has no material, White must avoid stalemate and deliver checkmate.

### Positional Observations:
- Black’s king is in the corner on b8 — ideal for a potential smothered mate or back-rank mating pattern.
- The white bishop and knights are still centralized but not very active yet.
- The white king is on c5, which is quite advanced and can help support a promotion or assist in a mating net.
- The h2 pawn is a passer and could be pushed eventually.

### Candidate Moves:
We must consider moves that improve coordination and restrict the black king further.

#### Let's evaluate some of the legal moves:

- **c5-d6**: Pushes the king toward the center; might be useful later but doesn't immediately threaten anything.
- **c5-c6**: Advances the king toward d7/b7 squares, potentially supporting a knight check on c7+.
- **c5-b6**: Brings the king closer to the black king’s zone, possibly helping with zugzwang.
- **c3-d4**, **c3-b4**, **c3-e5**, etc.: Developing the bishop to more active squares.
- **b1-d2**, **g1-e2**: Bringing knights into play, centralizing them.
- **h2-h3/h4**: Not particularly urgent unless preparing to advance the pawn later.

### Best Plan:
The key idea is to bring the white king closer to b7 or b6 to allow a knight check on c7+, forcing the black king to move, then follow up with a mating sequence.

A strong plan is:
1. Play the king to **c6**, threatening to support a knight jump to **a7+**, or **c7+**.
2. Then bring the knight from b1 to a3 or d2, aiming for c4 or e5.

### Best Move Now:
**c5-c6** – This move brings the king closer to the critical squares and prepares for a possible knight maneuver to a7 or c7.

2025-06-23 05:16:28,851 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 10.25s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/k7/2K5/8/8/2B5/7P/1N4N1 w - - 2 62`

### Position Summary:
- **White has a bishop on c3, king on c6, h-pawn on h2, and two knights on b1 and g1.**
- **Black has only a king on a7.**
- **Material is heavily in White's favor.**
- **Goal: Convert this winning position into a checkmate with precise technique.**

We must drive the Black king into a corner or restrict it so that we can deliver checkmate.

---

### Candidate Moves:

#### King moves:
- `c6-d7`, `c6-c7`, `c6-d6`, etc. — advancing the king to control more central squares.
  
#### Bishop moves:
- `c3-h8`, `c3-g7`, `c3-f6`, etc. — trying to control key diagonals.
- `c3-a5` — targeting the queenside where the black king is located.

#### Knight moves:
- `b1-a3`, `b1-d2`, `g1-e2`, `g1-f3`, etc. — developing knights for support.

#### Pawn move:
- `h2-h3`, `h2-h4` — not immediately useful unless we plan to promote later.

---

### Best Plan:
The black king is on a7. We want to cut off its escape routes and push it toward the edge of the board.

**Best immediate move: `c3-a5`**

This move:
- Places the bishop on a5, directly attacking b6 and controlling key squares around the black king.
- Restricts the black king’s mobility.
- Supports future king advancement (`c6-b5` or `c6-b6`) to squeeze the black king further.

It's a quiet but powerful move that improves our control significantly.

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`1k6/8/2K5/B7/8/8/7P/1N4N1 w - - 4 63`

### Material:
- **White** has: King on c6, Bishop on a5, Knight on b1, Knight on g1, and a pawn on h2.
- **Black** has: King on b8 (bare king).

This is an endgame with minimal material. Black has only a king, so White must be careful to avoid stalemate while aiming for checkmate.

---

### Goal:
Deliver **checkmate** to the black king while avoiding any possibility of **stalemate** or **draw**.

---

### Observations:
- The black king is confined in the corner on **b8**, which is promising.
- The white king is active on **c6**, already restricting much of the black king’s mobility.
- The white bishop on **a5** controls key light squares around the black king.
- The white knights are on **b1** and **g1**, both undeveloped and need activation.
- The h2 pawn is far from the action but could promote if needed.

---

### Candidate Moves:

#### King moves:
- `c6-d7`: Pushes the king forward, potentially helping to restrict the black king further.
- `c6-c5`, `c6-b6`, etc.: May open space and risk giving the black king room to maneuver.

#### Bishop moves:
- `a5-b6`: Attacks the black king directly and can help drive it toward the corner.
- `a5-d8`, `a5-c7`: These may not be as effective immediately.

#### Knight moves:
- `b1-d2`, `g1-f3`, `g1-e2`: Developing knights to support future mate patterns.
- Knights take time to get active, so immediate king or bishop moves are more urgent.

#### Pawn move:
- `h2-h3/h4`: Not urgent at this moment.

---

### Tactical Insight:

We want to deliver checkmate using the king, bishop, and knight(s), ideally driving the black king into the corner.

A strong idea is to play **`a5-b6+`**, checking the black king and forcing it to **a8**, where it can be mated with proper coordination.

After `a5-b6+`, black must play `b8-a8`.

Then we can follow up with:
- `c6-c7` (supporting the bishop)
- `Ka8-b8`
- Bring in the knights laterally (`Nb1-d2`, `Ng1-e3`) to deliver mate.

Mate can be delivered by a knight on `d6` or `c5`, depending on alignment.

So, **`a5-b6`** is the most precise move here.

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

---

### **FEN:**
`k7/8/1BK5/8/8/8/7P/1N4N1 w - - 6 64`

This is a late endgame with minimal material. White has:

- King on c6
- Bishop on b6
- Pawns: h2, b1 (Knight), g1 (Knight)

Black has:

- King on a8
- No pawns or other pieces visible

The move history suggests that both sides have already exchanged queens and most other material. The black king is confined to the corner but not yet in zugzwang.

---

### **Goal for White:**

White must try to force checkmate. With correct play, this should be a forced win due to superior mobility and active king.

---

### **Key Observations:**

- Black’s king is stuck near the corner.
- White’s bishop on b6 controls key light squares around the black king.
- The white king on c6 is well-placed but needs to support a mating net.
- The knight on b1 and g1 are both inactive but can be maneuvered.
- The h-pawn is on h2 and can advance later if needed.

---

### **Candidate Moves:**

We want to improve the position of our pieces while restricting the black king.

#### 1. **b6a5** – Removes bishop from b6, which might loosen control over a8.
#### 2. **b6d8** – Bishop to d8 threatens check and supports potential knight maneuvers.
#### 3. **b6c7** – Bishop pins the a8 king to the edge; very strong.
#### 4. **b6a7** – Takes away a7 from black king, forces it to a8.
#### 5. **c6d6/c6c7** – Advancing the king forward.

---

### **Best Move Analysis:**

Let’s look at **b6a7**, which takes away a7 from the black king. This forces the black king to stay on a8, where it is more restricted.

After **b6a7**, black’s only legal move is **Ka8-a7**, after which we can play **Ba8+**, forcing the king back to a8. Then we bring the king in via b6 to deliver mate with help from the bishop or a knight.

So:

1. **b6a7 Ka8-a7**
2. **Ba8 Ka8**
3. Then Kc6-b6# or prepare a knight to deliver mate.

This starts a forced mate sequence.

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/k7/2K5/8/8/8/7P/1N4N1 w - - 0 65`

### Board Position:
```
........
.K......
..K.....
........
........
........
......P.
.N....N.
```

White to move. The material is equal (King + Knight + Knight + Pawn vs lone King), but White has a **passed h-pawn** and a **king actively placed in the center**, supported by two knights.

Black’s king is on a7, quite restricted.

### Move History:
We can reconstruct that Black’s king was maneuvered around by White’s king and knights, and now it's cornered on the queenside.

### Goal:
White has a winning advantage. The goal is to either:

- Promote the h-pawn safely, or
- Corner the black king and deliver checkmate.

Given that White has two knights, a king, and a pawn, and Black has only a king, this is a classic case of "pawn and knights vs lone king" where precise play leads to a win.

---

## Candidate Moves:
From the list:  
`c6d7, c6c7, c6d6, c6d5, c6c5, c6b5, g1h3, g1f3, g1e2, b1c3, b1a3, b1d2, h2h3, h2h4`

We must evaluate which moves help us push for a win.

---

### Tactical & Strategic Evaluation:

#### 1. **Pushing the king forward:**
- `c6-c7` advances the king toward the center and threatens to support the h-pawn.
- This also cuts off escape routes for the black king.

#### 2. **Developing Knights:**
- Moving knights like `g1-e2`, `g1-f3`, or `b1-d2` helps centralize them and control more squares around the black king.
- `g1-h3` or `h2-h4` are less useful at this moment — we want to tighten the net around Black’s king, not expand space.

#### 3. **Pawn Pushes:**
- `h2-h3` or `h2-h4` are passive here. We should delay pawn pushes until the king is ready to escort it.

---

### Best Plan:
Advance the **White king with c6-c7**, tightening the noose and preparing to bring the knights into key squares.

This restricts the black king further and prepares for a possible knight-led mate or pawn promotion.

---

### Final Move:
```

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/2K5/k7/8/8/8/7P/1N4N1 w - - 2 66`

This is a late endgame with minimal material. White has a king, two knights, and a pawn on h2. Black has only a king.

White’s goal here is to promote the h2 pawn or maneuver in such a way that Black cannot stop it. However, promoting a pawn to a queen (or any piece) with only two knights and a king is not sufficient for a forced mate unless the defending king is in a very specific vulnerable position. But we must still aim to win if possible.

Let’s examine the **legal moves**:

- **Pawn promotion options from h2**:  
  `h2h3`, `h2h4`

- **King moves from c7**:  
  `c7d8`, `c7c8`, `c7b8`, `c7d7`, `c7d6`, `c7c6`

- **Knight moves from b1**:  
  `b1c3`, `b1a3`, `b1d2`

- **Knight moves from g1**:  
  `g1h3`, `g1f3`, `g1e2`

---

### Step-by-step analysis:

#### Goal: Promote the h2 pawn

The h2 pawn is currently on its starting square. Advancing it is key. Let's look at the best way to support its advance.

Black’s king is on a6 — far away from the kingside. This gives White a chance to push the pawn without immediate interference.

Let’s consider candidate moves:

---

### Candidate Move: `h2h4`

This move advances the pawn two squares immediately, bringing it to h4. It saves a tempo compared to moving one square first.

After `h4`, the pawn will continue to advance next move (`h5`, `h6`, etc.) while supported by the White king or knights.

White’s king is on c7 — it can march toward the kingside to assist the pawn.

Knights are on b1 and g1 — they need to be activated. One idea is to bring them to f3 and e2 to support each other and help control key squares around the pawn.

But for now, the most urgent and effective move is to start pushing the pawn.

---

### Evaluation of alternatives:

- `h2h3`: Slower than `h4`. Not optimal.
- King moves (`c7d8`, etc.): Premature. The king should stay centralized until needed to escort the pawn.
- Knight moves: Also premature. Knights are better used later to cover key squares near the queening square.

---

### Conclusion:

The best move is to **push the pawn as far as possible**, using `h2h4`.

This gains space, keeps the initiative, and begins the process of queening the pawn with minimal risk since Black’s king is too far to interfere in time.

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/2K5/8/1k6/7P/8/8/1N4N1 w - - 1 67`

This is a late endgame with minimal material. White has a king, two knights (on b1 and g1), and a pawn on h4. Black has only a king and a pawn on b5.

White’s goal here is to promote the h-pawn or use zugzwang to force a win. The key is that White must be careful not to stalemate Black by mistake.

Let’s look at the **legal moves**:

- **Pawn promotions**: `c7d8`, `c7c8`, `c7b8` — these are invalid in this context because there's no black piece on c-file for White to promote.
Wait! Correction: There is no pawn on c7. That was likely a misinterpretation of the board. So those moves are not valid. Let's re-evaluate based on correct understanding.

Actually, looking again at the FEN:

8/2K5/8/1k6/7P/8/8/1N4N1
```

White has:
- King on c7
- Knights on b1 and g1
- Pawn on h4

Black has:
- King on b5
- No other pieces

So the legal moves are:

- **King moves from c7**: `c7d8`, `c7d7`, `c7b7`, `c7b8`
- **Knight on b1**: `b1c3`, `b1a3`, `b1d2`
- **Knight on g1**: `g1h3`, `g1f3`, `g1e2`
- **Pawn on h4**: `h4h5`

Now let's evaluate each move strategically.

---

## Goal: Win the game.

Black's king is cut off from the kingside. White's h4 pawn can potentially advance and promote if supported properly.

The key idea is to push the h-pawn forward while keeping it protected and avoiding any stalemate traps.

Currently, Black's king is on b5. If White advances the h-pawn now (`h4h5`), it doesn't immediately threaten promotion but gives White more space and control.

However, we must avoid moving the king too far away from supporting the h-pawn later.

Let’s consider candidate moves:

### Candidate Move: `h4h5`

- Advances the pawn one step closer to promotion.
- Keeps the king nearby to support it.
- Does not risk stalemate yet.
- Gives White more time to maneuver.

Other knight moves may help in positioning but don’t directly contribute to winning unless they assist in pushing the pawn.

Moving the king (`c7d8`, etc.) risks getting too far from the action or even walking into a stalemate.

Thus, the best plan is to **push the h-pawn**, preparing for a potential breakthrough.

---

### Final Decision:
```
h4h5

Let's analyze the position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/2K5/8/7P/1k6/8/8/1N4N1 w - - 1 68`

This is a late endgame with minimal material. White has a king, two knights, and a pawn on h5. Black has only a king and a pawn on b4.

White’s goal is to promote the h-pawn or prevent counterplay while advancing the c-pawn (which just moved to c7 in move 67). The black king is active and currently on b4, which is dangerous for the c-pawn.

### Move History:
- a5xb6
- b8xa8
- b6xa7
- a8xa7
- c6-c7
- a7-a6
- h2-h4
- a6-b5
- h4-h5
- b5-b4

Now it's White's turn.

### Legal Moves:
```
c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7d7, c7b7, c7d6, c7c6, c7b6,
g1h3, g1f3, g1e2, b1c3, b1a3, b1d2, h5h6
```

We must evaluate each move carefully.

---

## Candidate Moves:

### 1. **c7c8q** – Promoting the pawn immediately.
- This would be ideal if safe.
- But after `c7c8q`, Black plays `b4b3` and threatens to queen their own pawn.
- With no checks or immediate threats against the black king, this could allow Black to promote as well.
- **Risky**: Black might get a queen first and deliver check or win material.

### 2. **h5h6**
- Advances the h-pawn one step closer to promotion.
- This is a quiet but solid move.
- It keeps pressure and reserves options for the c-pawn.
- However, it doesn't directly protect the c7 pawn from the black king.

### 3. **c7b7** – Moving the pawn forward to b7.
- Keeps the pawn protected by the white king.
- King on c7 can support it.
- Prevents the black king from capturing it easily.
- Also prepares for possible underpromotion or queening next move.

### 4. **c7d7** – Moving toward the center.
- Exposes the pawn to more danger from the black king.
- Not ideal; allows Black to approach more easily.

### 5. **c7d6**, **c7b6**, etc.
- These moves retreat the pawn or place it where it's vulnerable.
- Not advisable.

### 6. **Knight moves (g1h3, g1f3, g1e2, b1c3, b1a3, b1d2)**
- Knights are best used in closed positions.
- Here, the board is open and pawns are advanced.
- Knight moves don’t contribute meaningfully to promoting either side’s pawns.
- Likely wasting time.

---

## Best Move Analysis:

The key is to **secure the c-pawn and advance it safely**, ideally under protection of the white king.

After evaluating all lines, the most secure and forcing move is:

### ✅ **c7b7**

Why?
- Keeps the pawn on the 7th rank.
- Places it on a square still supported by the white king on c7.
- Prevents the black king from easily approaching and capturing it.
- Sets up for a potential **c8 promotion** on the next move.
- Controls tempo and limits Black's counterplay.

Black cannot take on b7 because White's king supports it (`c7-b7`).

Also, pushing **h5h6** is tempting, but not urgent yet — better to secure the c-pawn first.

---

Final move:
```
c7b7

- c6c7, a7a6  
- h2h4, a6b5  
- h4h5, b5b4  
- c7b7, b4c5  

We are now at move 69, and White has several legal moves to consider:

### Legal Moves:
- `b7c8`, `b7b8`, `b7a8`, `b7c7`, `b7a7`, `b7a6` (from pawn on b7)
- `g1h3`, `g1f3`, `g1e2`, `b1c3`, `b1a3`, `b1d2` (knight moves)
- `h5h6` (pawn push)

---

## Evaluation:

White has two knights, a king, and a few pawns. Black has only a king and a pawn on the c-file. The critical elements:

- **White's passed pawn on b7** is close to queening.
- **Black's king is active**, currently on c5, and could potentially intercept the b7-pawn if not handled carefully.
- **White's king is on b7**, very close to the action.
- **The h5-pawn can advance to h6**, but pushing it prematurely may allow ...c5-c4 and a potential race.
- **White's knights (on b1 and g1)** are still undeveloped and far from the center of action.

---

## Plan:

The most immediate winning plan is to **promote the b7-pawn safely**. Since the White king is already on b7, we should continue advancing the pawn with support.

However, we must be cautious: if we play `b7b8q` immediately, the Black king can respond with `...Kc6` and capture the queen in one move unless supported.

So instead, we should **move the pawn to b8 and promote to a rook or knight**, which avoids immediate loss and allows us to control the square c7.

Promoting to a **rook** gives more flexibility for controlling files and ranks.

Thus, best move is:

```
b7b8r
```

This keeps full control over the position, prevents any counterplay, and sets up for a straightforward win.

---

```
b7b8r
```

2025-06-23 05:18:37,492 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 15.14s):
Apologies for the mistake. Let's re-evaluate carefully.

### Current Position:
```
[White "To Move"]
[FEN "8/1K6/8/2k4P/8/8/8/1N4N1 w - - 3 69"]
```

We are to choose from these **legal moves**:

`b7c8`, `b7b8`, `b7a8`, `b7c7`, `b7a7`, `b7a6`, `g1h3`, `g1f3`, `g1e2`, `b1c3`, `b1a3`, `b1d2`, `h5h6`

---

## Key Observations:

- The **b7-pawn is on the 7th rank**, and promoting it is White’s main winning chance.
- Promoting directly to a queen (`b7b8q`) would be met by `...Kc6` capturing the queen, unless supported.
- However, **promoting to a rook or knight** is not in the legal move list — that means only underpromotion to those pieces is disallowed here.
- So, valid promotions are only `b7b8q` (queen) or possibly `b7b8r` if allowed by rules, but clearly it's **not** in this engine's legality check.
- Therefore, promotion must be to **queen only** if we push to b8.

But again, pushing `b7b8q` is dangerous because of `...Kc6` immediately after, capturing the queen.

So instead of rushing to promote, we should **support the pawn first** with the king.

The best way to do that is:

### Candidate Move: `b7b8q` – **leads to immediate loss of queen** after `...Kc6`.

Not safe.

### Candidate Move: `b7a8` – walks the pawn away from the center, allows `...Kc6` and control over b7.

Not ideal.

### Candidate Move: `b7c8` – pushes forward into danger; `...Kc6` again threatens the queening square.

Still risky.

### Best Plan:

Move the **White king closer to support the pawn**, ideally to **b7** or **b8**, but the pawn is already on b7.

Thus, the correct idea is to **push the pawn to b8 with promotion**, but only if the king can support it.

However, since `b7b8r` is illegal and `b7b8n` or `b7b8r` are not options, and queen leads to capture...

Let’s consider an alternative plan:

### Support the pawn with a knight.

White has two knights on b1 and g1. They are far from the action.

A good candidate is to bring one knight closer to support the pawn.

### Move: `b1c3`

This develops the knight toward the center and prepares to support the queenside pawns.

It also keeps pressure on the c5-square near the Black king.

This move improves piece activity without risking anything.

After this, White can continue with Kb7-b8 later with better support.

---

Final decision:

```
b1c3
```

2025-06-23 05:18:56,262 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 17.38s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/1K6/8/7P/1k6/2N5/8/6N1 w - - 5 70`

### Board Position:
```
[FEN "8/1K6/8/7P/1k6/2N5/8/6N1 w - - 5 70"]
```

We can visualize the board as follows:

- **White King** is on b7.
- **White Knight** is on c3.
- **White Knight** is also on g1.
- **White has a pawn** on h5.
- **Black King** is on b4.

This is an endgame with minimal material. The key elements are:

- White’s king is very advanced, on b7.
- Black’s king is on b4 — close to being boxed in.
- White has a knight on c3 and one on g1.
- A white pawn is on h5.

The goal here is to **convert this into a win**, if possible. Since it's a simplified position, we should look for any way to promote or corner the black king.

---

## Candidate Moves

Let’s evaluate all legal moves:

### King Moves (from b7):
- `b7c8`: King to c8 – not useful; too far from action.
- `b7b8`: King stays on same file – no progress.
- `b7a8`: King retreats – not helpful.
- `b7c7`: King to c7 – still not ideal.
- `b7a7`: King to a7 – away from center of action.
- `b7c6`: King to c6 – possibly useful, closer to b4.
- `b7b6`: King remains on b-file – not useful.
- `b7a6`: King to a6 – again, not directly threatening.

### Knight on c3:
- `c3d5`: Knight to d5 – active square, controls c7 and b4.
- `c3b5`: Knight to b5 – threatens but not immediately decisive.
- `c3e4`: Knight to e4 – supports potential king march.
- `c3a4`: Knight to a4 – passive.
- `c3e2`: Knight to e2 – regressing.
- `c3a2`: Knight to a2 – passive.
- `c3d1`: Knight to d1 – clearly bad.
- `c3b1`: Knight to b1 – also bad.

### Knight on g1:
- `g1h3`, `g1f3`, `g1e2` – these are developing moves, but slow.

### Pawn move:
- `h5h6` – advances the pawn, creates a potential passer on the h-file.

---

## Best Plan

White has a chance to **corner the black king** using the king and knight.

Key idea: Use the knight on c3 to go to **d5**, controlling **b4**, where the black king is stuck. Then use the white king to pressurize the black king.

Let’s consider the move:

### `c3d5`

- This puts the knight on d5.
- It attacks b4 (where the black king is).
- Forces the black king to move.
- White can then follow up with Kb6 or Kc6 to continue pressing.

This is a **very strong move** that limits black’s options and builds pressure.

---

## Final Decision

2025-06-23 05:19:11,758 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 14.15s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/1K6/8/3N3P/8/1k6/8/6N1 w - - 7 71`

### Material:
- **White**: King on b7, Knight on d5, pawn on h5, and knight on g1.
- **Black**: King on b3.

This is a late endgame with minimal material. White has a king, two knights, and a pawn; Black has only a king.

### Goal:
White has a clear material advantage (two knights and a pawn vs. lone king), so **winning is objectively possible**. The key is to avoid stalemate and promote the h-pawn or deliver checkmate.

---

## Step-by-step Analysis:

### 1. **White’s h-pawn is advanced**, and if it can be promoted, that will decide the game. However, **a knight alone cannot win in a K+pawn vs K endgame unless the opposition king is pushed away**.

### 2. **White’s king is currently on b7**, which is quite far from the action. It needs to march toward the center or kingside to support the h-pawn.

### 3. **White’s knights are on d5 and g1**. The knight on d5 is active and controls many squares. The knight on g1 is passive and needs repositioning.

### 4. **Black’s king is on b3**, far from the h-pawn, so it poses no immediate threat to stop the pawn. But if White isn't careful, Black could potentially stalemate itself by having no legal moves when the White king blocks everything.

---

## Candidate Moves:

### King moves from b7:
- **b7-c8 / b7-b8 / b7-a8 / b7-c7 / b7-a7 / b7-c6 / b7-b6 / b7-a6**

These all aim to centralize or bring the king closer to the action. Most of these are too slow or not helpful immediately.

### Knight on d5:
- **d5-e7 / d5-c7 / d5-f6 / d5-b6 / d5-f4 / d5-b4 / d5-e3 / d5-c3**

We should look for a move that improves coordination and doesn’t lose tempo. For example, **d5-f6** supports the h-pawn and prepares to control key squares around the promotion square.

### Knight on g1:
- **g1-h3 / g1-f3 / g1-e2**

These are developing moves, but again, slower than needed.

---

## Best Plan:
- Move the **knight from d5 to f6**, supporting the h-pawn and preparing to push h5-h6 and eventually h6-h7-h8=Q.
- This also keeps Black’s options limited and avoids any chance of stalemate.

---

Let's analyze the position carefully and determine the best move.

---

### **Position Analysis (FEN):**
```
8/1K6/5N2/7P/1k6/8/8/6N1 w - - 9 72
```

**White to move.**

We have:
- White King on b7
- White Knight on f6
- White Pawn on h5, advanced to h5
- White Knight on g1 (undeveloped)
- Black King on b4 (very active)
- Black has no material left

This is a king and knight + pawns vs king endgame. The key is whether White can promote the h-pawn or not, while preventing any drawing chances due to stalemate or inactivity.

Black’s only hope is to draw by either:
- Stalemating the white king
- Preventing the h-pawn from advancing
- Or forcing a 50-move rule draw

White’s plan should be to support the h-pawn's advance with minimal moves and precision.

h4h5, b5b4, c7b7, b4c5, b1c3, c5b4, c3d5, b4b3, d5f6, b3b4  
This shows that both sides have advanced their kings, and black has been very active trying to interfere with white’s plans.

---

### **Legal Moves:**
We must choose one of these:

`b7c8, b7b8, b7a8, b7c7, b7a7, b7c6, b7b6, b7a6, f6g8, f6e8, f6h7, f6d7, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4, g1h3, g1f3, g1e2, h5h6`

Let’s evaluate the most promising options.

---

## 🔍 Candidate Move Evaluation:

### 🧠 1. `h5h6` – **Advance the pawn toward promotion**
- This is likely the strongest move.
- The h-pawn is now on h6, one step closer to queening.
- It avoids giving Black time to maneuver the king into interference squares.
- White can follow up with Kb7-b6 or Kb7-c7 to support the pawn.

**Pros:**
- Forces immediate progress
- Keeps initiative
- Most direct path to win

**Cons:**
- Must ensure the king or knight can support it without allowing stalemate tricks

🟢 **Strongest move so far.**

---

### 🧠 2. `f6g4`, `f6e4`, etc. – Moving the knight
- These moves do not directly help the h-pawn promote.
- They risk wasting a tempo when White needs to push for promotion quickly.
- Not ideal unless there's a tactical reason.

🔴 **Not recommended at this moment.**

---

### 🧠 3. `b7b8`, `b7c8`, etc. – Moving the king forward
- Advancing the king could be useful, but only if it helps support the h-pawn.
- However, moving to b8 or c8 doesn't immediately help the pawn on h5.
- Best king route would be toward e.g., b6 or c6 to centralize.

🟡 **Possible, but less urgent than pushing the pawn.**

---

### ✅ **Best Move: `h5h6`**
Pushes the pawn forward decisively, keeps the opponent under pressure, and begins the final march toward queening.

Let's analyze the position carefully.

### Current FEN:
```
8/1K6/5N1P/8/8/1k6/8/6N1 w - - 1 73
```

### Material:
- **White** has: King on b7, Knight on f6, pawn on h6, and Knight on g1.
- **Black** has: King on b3. That’s it — only a king.

### Goal:
Since White is up significantly in material (a knight and a pawn), and Black has no counterplay, the goal is to promote the h6 pawn or bring in the white king to assist in checkmate or promotion.

### Observations:
- The black king is very active and currently on b3, threatening to invade further.
- The white king is dangerously exposed on b7 and must be brought into a safer or more active position.
- The white knight on f6 is well placed, potentially supporting a mating net or blocking black's king.
- The h6 pawn is advanced but needs support to promote safely.
- The white knight on g1 is far away and will take time to join the attack.

### Immediate Threats:
- Black's king could head toward c2, then d3, possibly even threatening to get behind the h-pawn and stop its promotion.
- If White doesn't act precisely, Black might be able to draw by stalemate or by stopping the pawn.

### Plan:
1. Bring the white king closer to the center or toward the kingside to support the h6 pawn.
2. Use the knights to control key squares around the black king.
3. Avoid any stalemate traps.
4. Push the h6 pawn forward when safe.

### Candidate Moves:
- **b7c7**: Centralizes the king slightly and keeps options open.
- **b7c6**: Brings the king closer to the center and supports potential knight maneuvers.
- **b7a6**: Too passive; not ideal.
- **f6g4 / f6h5 / f6d5**: These knight moves may help restrict the black king or support the h6 pawn's advance.

### Best Move:
The most logical move is **b7c6**, which brings the white king closer to the action and prepares to support the h6 pawn or coordinate with the knights.

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/8/2K2N1P/8/8/8/2k5/6N1 w - - 3 74`

### Board Position:
```
........
........
..K2.N.1P
........
........
........

......N.
```

White to move.

### Key Observations:

- White has a knight on f6, a pawn on h6, and king on c6.
- Black has a king on c2 and no pawns.
- The white king is very close to promoting the h-pawn (h6 → h7 → h8=Q).
- The black king is far from the action but centralized.
- The key idea for White is to push the h-pawn to promote it, while using the knight and king to prevent counterplay or stalemate tricks.
- The white knight on f6 can control important squares around the promotion square and help escort the pawn.

### Goal:
Promote the h-pawn with support, ideally without allowing Black to create a fortress or stalemate.

### Candidate Moves:

1. **h6-h7** – Pushes the pawn forward; forces promotion one step closer.
2. **Nf6-g8** – Knight heads toward h8 to control squares around promotion.
3. **Nf6-d7** – Supports h6 and prepares to control squares near h8.
4. **Kc6-d7** – King centralizes and supports the pawn.
5. **Kc6-c7** – Advances king up the board.

Now let’s evaluate each in detail.

---

### Move: `h6h7`
- Immediately advances the pawn.
- Forces the knight to reposition to defend against possible threats.
- After this, White will have a passed h7-pawn that can promote next move unless blocked.
- However, pushing now may allow Black to maneuver into a stalemate if not careful.

### Move: `f6g8`
- Knight moves to g8, eyeing h6 and controlling squares around the promotion square.
- Not immediately aggressive, but improves coordination.
- Allows White to prepare for h7 support.

### Move: `f6d7`
- Knight moves to d7, supporting h6 and preparing to control squares near the queening square.
- Good support for the h-pawn.
- Also allows the king to advance safely.

### Move: `c6d7`
- King moves forward, abandoning control of c6.
- May expose White to counterplay if the knight isn't well placed.

### Move: `c6c7`
- King moves up, still keeping pressure.
- Slower than advancing the pawn or improving the knight.

---

### Best Plan:
The best approach is to **immediately push the pawn to h7**, forcing Black to respond. This keeps momentum and prevents any defensive setups.

If we play passively (e.g., moving the knight first), Black might try to draw by stalemate or triangulation.

So, the most decisive and forcing move is:

```
h6h7
```

This puts maximum pressure on the opponent and keeps the initiative.

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/7P/2K2N2/8/8/8/8/3k2N1 w - - 1 75`

### Board Position:

```
8 | . . . . . . . .
7 | . . . . . . . P
6 | . . K . . N . .
5 | . . . . . . . .
4 | . . . . . . . .
3 | . . . . . . . .
2 | . . . . . . . .
1 | . . . k . . N .
    +----------------
    a b c d e f g h
```

### Key Observations:

- **White is about to promote the h-pawn** (only one move away from queening).
- The **White king is very active**, sitting on c6.
- The **Black king is in the corner** on d1, with limited space.
- White has a knight on f6 and another on g1.
- Black has no material left.
- It's **White to move**.

### Goal:
Since White has a decisive advantage, we should aim for a **quick, clean win**. The most immediate idea is to **promote the pawn**, but we must also consider whether checkmate can be delivered even faster.

However, since promotion is just one move away (h7-h8=Q), and there’s no threat from Black, it makes sense to proceed with that unless a faster forced mate exists.

But before promoting, let's look at all options:

---

### Candidate Moves:

1. **h7h8q** – Promote to queen (obvious choice)
2. **f6g8 / f6e8** – Move knight to g8 or e8 (to assist in mating net)
3. **c6d7 / c6c7** – Advance the king toward the center or support promotion

---

### Let's evaluate each:

#### 1. `h7h8q` – Promotion to Queen
This gives White an overwhelming material advantage. After this, it's trivial to deliver checkmate with the queen and king. For example:

- 1. h8=Q Kc2
- 2. Qa1 Kb3
- 3. Kd5 etc.

This is safe and effective.

#### 2. `f6g8` or `f6e8`
Moving the knight first doesn't help speed up the win. It may even give Black some room to survive longer.

#### 3. `c6d7` or `c6c7`
Advancing the king is slower than promoting immediately.

---

### Conclusion:
The best move is to **promote the pawn to queen now**. There's no danger of stalemate, and it leads directly to a simple win.

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:

### Board Position:

```

### Key Observations:

- **White has a queen (Qh8) and two knights (Ng1, Nf6), and a king (Kc6).**
- **Black has only a lone king on c1.**
- **White is up by a massive amount of material.**
- **The goal now is to deliver checkmate as efficiently as possible.**

### Objective:
Deliver checkmate in the fewest moves. We must drive the black king to the edge or corner and deliver mate.

---

### Candidate Moves:

We have many legal moves, but we are looking for the most forcing and efficient path to checkmate.

#### Queen moves from h8:
- **Qa8**: Controls a8–a1 file; could help box in the black king.
- **Qb8**: Same idea, slightly less effective.
- **Qh7, Qg7, Qh6, etc.**: These bring the queen closer, possibly useful for mating net.
- **Qd8/Qc8**: Also good for controlling central files.

#### Knight moves:
- **Nf6-d5/Nf6-e4/Nf6-g4**: Knights can support mate in corner.
- **Nf6-d7+/Nf6-h7**: Might be checks, but not immediately useful.
- **Ng1-f3/Ng1-e2/Ng1-h3**: Bringing the other knight into play.

#### King moves:
- **Kc6-c7/Kc6-b6/Kc6-d6**: Centralizing or advancing the king to assist in checkmate.

---

### Best Plan:
Use the queen to restrict the black king’s movement, then use the knights and king to deliver checkmate in the corner.

Let’s begin with **Qa8**, which controls the a-file and starts boxing the black king into the a1 corner.

From there, we can follow up with Kb6 or Kb7 to advance the white king toward the enemy king.

This is a classic "queen and knight(s) + king vs lone king" endgame pattern — control, compress, and mate.

2025-06-23 05:20:49,968 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 16.35s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully:

### FEN:
`Q7/8/2K2N2/8/8/8/2k5/6N1 w - - 3 77`

### Material:
- **White** has a queen, king, knight (g1), and knight (f6).
- **Black** has a king.

### King Safety:
- Both kings are relatively safe.
- White’s king is on c6, quite advanced.
- Black’s king is on c2, near the center of the back rank.

### Tactical Observations:
- The white queen is on a8.
- The black king is on c2 — within striking distance of several white pieces.
- It's **move 77**, so this is an endgame scenario with minimal material.
- Black’s king is vulnerable to a mating net due to its position on the second rank.

### Goal:
Deliver checkmate as efficiently as possible. White is clearly winning here, but must be precise.

---

### Candidate Moves:

#### Queen moves:
- `Qa8-a7`, `Qa8-b8`, `Qa8-c7` – these could help restrict the black king.
- `Qa8-d8+` – might force the black king up a rank.

#### Knight moves:
- `Nf6-e4`, `Nf6-d5`, etc. – can potentially assist in a smothered mate or restrict king movement.
- `Ng1-e2/f3/h3` – also for positioning.

#### King moves:
- `Kc6-b6/c5/d5` – centralizing or supporting the queen/knight.

---

### Best Plan:
Use the queen to drive the black king toward the edge while coordinating the knights and king to deliver checkmate.

Let’s evaluate the move that best continues this plan:

### Move: `Qa8-d8+`

This forces the black king to move forward (`Kc2-b1`, `Kc2-b2`, `Kc2-c1`, or `Kc2-c3`), tightening the noose and giving White more control over the board.

After `Qd8+`, we can follow up with:
- `Kc6-b6` or `Kc6-b5` to centralize the king.
- Then bring in the knights to deliver mate.

This move maintains full control and doesn't allow any counterplay.

Let's analyze the position carefully.

### Current FEN:
```
3Q4/8/2K2N2/8/8/8/1k6/6N1 w - - 5 78
```

### Material:
- **White** has a Queen (d8), King (c6), Knight (f6), and Knight (g1).
- **Black** has only a King (b2).

### Evaluation:
- White is up by a massive amount of material (queen and two knights vs. just a king).
- Black cannot win, but can potentially draw by stalemate or repetition if not careful.
- The black king is currently on b2, and the white king is on c6. The white queen is on d8.
- The immediate danger is that if White is not precise, Black may be able to set up a fortress or get into a stalemate situation due to lack of space and limited material.

### Goal:
Secure a forced mate in the fewest moves possible without risking a stalemate.

---

### Candidate Moves:

We must avoid any move that removes all legal moves from Black’s king (that would be stalemate). So we must ensure that every move either drives the black king into a tighter space or threatens checkmate.

#### Let's evaluate key options:

##### 1. **Queen moves toward the center or towards the black king:**
- **Qd8-d7**: Restricts Kb2, keeps pressure.
- **Qd8-c7**: Also pressures b2 via a file.
- **Qd8-d6**: Very strong – cuts off escape on 6th rank, forces Kb2 to move.
- **Qd8-b6+**: Checks the king directly, forcing Kb1 or Ka2. This is very promising.

Let’s look at **Qb6+** more closely.

After **Qb6+**, Black must move:
- **...Kc1** (only legal move)
Then:
- **Kc6-c7**, threatening mate with help of knight.

But let’s simulate a line:

1. Qb6+ Kc1  
2. Kc7 Kb1  
3. Qa7 Kb2  
4. Qa3 Kb1  
5. Qb3+ Kc1  
6. Qc2#

This seems like a forced path.

Alternatively, after **Qb6+**, if Black plays **Ka1**, then we can follow up with **Qb3**, cutting off escape again.

So **Qb6+** is a very strong candidate.

##### 2. Other queen moves:
- **Qd8-d5**, **Qd8-a5**, etc., are slower.
- **Qd8-h8**, **Qd8-g8**, etc., are retreating and give Black room to maneuver — dangerous.

##### 3. Knight moves:
- Moving knights is risky; they can inadvertently stalemate or allow Black to gain space.
- For example, **Nf6-e8** gives Black more freedom.

##### 4. King moves:
- **Kc6-c7**, **Kc6-b7**, etc., are too slow unless supported by queen.

---

### Best Move:
The best plan is to deliver a check with the queen to force the black king into a corner and begin a mating net.

The move **Qb6+** is optimal here.

---

### Final Answer:
```
d8b6
```

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/8/1QK2N2/8/8/8/2k5/6N1 w - - 7 79`

### Board Position:
```
........
........
. Q K N ..
........
........
........
..k.....
.......N
```

White to move.

### Key Observations:

- **White King on c6** is very active and close to the enemy king.
- **White Queen on b6** is well-placed, attacking key squares around the Black King.
- **Black King on c2** is somewhat confined but not yet in a mating net.
- **White has a Knight on f6** and another on g1 — both can be activated.
- The position is a late-endgame with no pawns left.
- White has a material advantage (queen + two knights vs. lone king). This is a theoretical win if played correctly.

### Goal:
Deliver checkmate or force a winning position without allowing stalemate or perpetual checks.

### Candidate Moves:

#### King moves:
- **c6-d7**, **c6-c7**, **c6-b7**: Advancing the king toward the center or up the board.
- **c6-d6**, **c6-b6**, etc.: Less useful; already centralized.

#### Queen moves:
- **b6-b8**, **b6-a7**, **b6-c7**: All threaten mate on the next move or restrict Black’s king.
- **b6-d8**, **b6-b7**, **b6-a6**, **b6-c5**, etc.: Useful for support or preventing escape.

#### Knights:
- **f6-g4**, **f6-e4**, **f6-d5**, **f6-h5**, **f6-d7**: Some of these squares are useful for delivering mate.
- **g1-f3**, **g1-e2**, **g1-h3**: Activating the knight from the corner.

### Plan:
We want to box in the Black King using the queen and king, while bringing in the knights for a final checkmate.

The ideal setup would be something like:
- Queen controls the c-file or d-file.
- One knight delivers mate on b4 or d3.
- Other knight supports or covers escape squares.
- White King tightens the net.

Let’s evaluate the most promising move:

### Move: `b6a7`

This move places the queen on a7, controlling the a-file and the 7th rank. It also prepares to bring the knight to d5 or e4 to deliver checkmate later. It limits Black’s king mobility significantly.

After `b6a7`, the queen is still active, and we can follow up with:
- **Nf6-d5+**, forcing the black king to move to b2 or b1,
- Then **Kc6-b6**, supporting the queen,
- Followed by **Ng1-e2** or **Ng1-f3**, setting up for a mate.

This move keeps all options open and increases pressure.

### Final Decision:
```
b6a7
```

Let's analyze the position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/Q7/2K2N2/8/8/8/1k6/6N1 w - - 9 80`

### Material:
- **White**: Queen (a7), Knight (f6, g1), King (c6)
- **Black**: King (b2)

White has a decisive material advantage — a queen and two knights versus a lone black king. Black’s king is dangerously close to the edge of the board, making it vulnerable to checkmate.

### Goal:
Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible. There is no danger of losing here; White just needs to finish the game efficiently.

### Observations:
- The white queen is on a7, attacking along the 7th rank and diagonally toward b8.
- The white king is on c6, central and active.
- The black king is on b2, in the corner — this is ideal for delivering checkmate.
- The white knight on f6 is well-placed and ready to deliver support.
- The knight on g1 can be mobilized if needed, but not immediately necessary.

### Candidate Moves:
We are looking for a forced mate sequence. Let's evaluate key options:

#### 1. `a7b8+` – Queen checks the king on b8
This forces the black king to move. But where?
- After `1... Kb2 -> Kb1 -> Kb8`, we might repeat positions unless we restrict escape squares.

But is there a faster way?

#### 2. `f6e8` or `f6h7` – Knight maneuvering
These may help box in the black king further, but they delay an immediate threat from the queen.

#### 3. `a7a8` – Moving queen to a8, threatening check on b7 or b8 next move.

Still slower than giving an immediate check.

---

Let’s look at the most forcing line:

### Move: `a7b8+`
Check on b8.

**Line:**
1. `a7b8+ Kb1`  
2. `f6d7` – Knight threatens b2 with tempo.  
   - If `Kb1 -> Ka1`, then `Qb3#`  
   - If `Ka2`, then `Qb3+ Ka1`, again `Qa3#`  
   - If `Kb2`, then `Nd4` followed by `Qa3#`

This leads to a forced mate in 3–4 moves depending on black's reply.

Alternatively, even simpler:

### Cleaner Mate Plan:
Try `a7a8` first — queen to a8, preparing `Qa3+` and force the black king into the corner.

But why not go straight for the throat?

Let’s test:

### Try `a7b8+ Kb1`
Now play `f6e4!`  
Threatens `Qb2#`  
Black cannot stop mate.

So yes, **`a7b8+`** is a strong candidate.

Let’s confirm no better option exists.

Other queen moves (`a7g7`, `a7h7`) don't threaten anything directly.

Knight moves like `f6e8` or `f6h5` are too slow.

King moves (`c6d7`, etc.) also waste time.

### ✅ Best Move:
The most direct and forcing move is:

```
a7b8
```

2025-06-23 05:21:58,904 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 16.91s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`1Q6/8/2K2N2/8/8/k7/8/6N1 w - - 11 81`

### Material:
- **White** has a queen (b8), knight (f6), king (c6), and another knight (g1).
- **Black** has only a king (a3).

### Evaluation:
This is a winning position for White. The Black king is almost in the corner, and White has overwhelming material to deliver checkmate.

The goal is to use the queen and/or knights to corner the Black king with help from the White king.

We must be cautious not to stalemate Black by accident. Since Black’s only piece is the king, we must ensure that every move either restricts the king while still leaving it with legal moves or delivers checkmate directly.

### Candidate Moves:
We are looking for a move that either:
- Closes in on checkmate.
- Forces the Black king into fewer squares.
- Avoids giving away material or allowing stalemating opportunities.

#### Queen moves:
- **b8h8**, **b8g8**, **b8f8**, **b8e8**, **b8d8**, **b8c8**, **b8a8**: These all move the queen far away from the action near c6 and a3. Not ideal.
- **b8c7**, **b8b7**, **b8a7**: These control more central squares.
- **b8d6**, **b8e5**, **b8f4**, etc.: These could be useful for delivering mate.

#### Knight on f6:
- **f6g8**, **f6e8**, **f6h7**, **f6d7**, **f6h5**, **f6d5**, **f6g4**, **f6e4**: Many of these bring the knight closer to the Black king.

#### King on c6:
- **c6d7**, **c6c7**, **c6b7**, **c6d6**, **c6b6**, **c6d5**, **c6c5**, **c6b5**: These move the king toward the center or toward the queenside.

#### Knight on g1:
- **g1h3**, **g1f3**, **g1e2**: These develop the knight but may take time.

---

### Plan:
We want to close in quickly on the Black king. The most effective way is likely using the queen and both knights supported by the White king.

A strong candidate is:

### `b8e5+`

#### Why?
- It places the queen one square diagonally from the Black king at a3 (via e5), giving it tight control over escape squares.
- It gives check, forcing the Black king to move.
- It keeps the queen active and centrally placed.
- It avoids moving the queen too far from the action or placing it where it can be attacked (which none of the Black pieces can do anyway).

After `b8e5+`, Black’s only move is `Ka3-a2` or `Ka3-b2`.

Then White can follow up with something like `Ke5` or bringing in the knights to assist.

---

### Final Move:
```
b8e5
```

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`1Q6/8/2K2N2/8/2k5/8/8/6N1 w - - 19 85`

### Material:
- **White** has a queen (b8), knight (f6, g1), and king (c6).
- **Black** has only a king (c4).

### Positional Assessment:
- White is up by a queen and two knights.
- Black has no pawns or material.
- The black king is on c4, somewhat centralized but not dangerous.
- The white king is on c6, quite advanced and in a good position to assist in a mating net.
- The white queen is on b8. It can deliver checkmate with support from the king or knights.
- The white knight on f6 is well placed; it attacks several key squares near the black king.
- The knight on g1 is far away and not immediately useful.

### Goal:
With such a large material advantage, the goal is to **force a quick checkmate** without allowing any drawing chances for Black.

### Candidate Moves:
We are looking to use the queen and king or queen and knight(s) to create a mating net.

#### Move: `b8g8`
This moves the queen to g8, which puts pressure on the g-file and potentially supports a mate along the back rank or with the knight on f6.

But more importantly...

#### Move: `b8a7+`
This checks the black king!

Let’s explore this deeply:

##### After `b8a7+`:
- Queen checks the black king from a7.
- Black king must move. His options are:
  - `c4d4`
  - `c4b4`
  - `c4b5`
  - `c4d5`

In all cases, we can continue tightening the net using the queen and king, possibly supported by the knight on f6.

Let’s go ahead and play the **only checking move** currently available — it forces the black king to react and gives us initiative.

```
b8a7

### Candidate Moves:
We want to either:
1. Deliver checkmate immediately.
2. Force Black into a position where mate is unavoidable.

Let’s evaluate some key options:

#### `a7a6+`
- Checks the black king.
- Forces Kb3.
- Followed by Qb5+, K moves, then Qb7# or Nc5# — very strong.

#### `a7b8`
- Removes the check, not ideal here since we can give check and restrict the black king.

#### `c6d6`
- Advances the king toward the center, but doesn’t threaten mate yet.

#### `f6g4`
- Knight move toward the black king, but not immediately decisive.

The best approach is to **check the black king** and force it into a tighter space.

### Best Move:
`a7a6+`  
This forces Kb3, after which White can play Qb5+, Kc2 (or c3), then follow up with Qb2# or use a knight for support.

```
a7a6
```

2025-06-23 05:22:44,704 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 13.98s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/1K6/Q4N2/8/1k6/8/8/6N1 w - - 25 88`

### Material:
- **White** has a queen (a6), a knight (f6), and a knight (g1).
- **Black** has only a king (b4).

This is an endgame with White having a decisive material advantage. The goal is to convert this into a win by checkmating Black.

### Positional Observations:
- The Black king is on b4, quite exposed.
- The White queen is on a6, already exerting pressure along the 6th rank and can potentially control squares around the Black king.
- The White king is on b7, very close to the action — ideal for supporting a mating net.
- There are multiple White knights that can be used to deliver checkmate with support from the king or queen.

### Tactical Ideas:
We want to restrict the Black king’s movement and drive it into a corner. The queen and knights are excellent at creating a mating net in such positions.

### Candidate Moves:
Let’s consider key candidate moves:

#### Queen moves:
- `a6b6+`: Checks the king and forces it backward.
- `a6a5+`: Also checks, but less effective.
- `a6c6`, `a6d6`, `a6e6`: Support a push toward the center or restrict king mobility.
- `a6a8`: Retreats, not useful here.

#### Knight moves:
- `f6g8`, `f6e8`: These move away; not helpful.
- `f6d7`, `f6d5`, `f6h5`: These approach the king and may help in a mating net.
- `f6g4+`: Delivers check and pressures c3 and b4 squares.

#### King moves:
- `b7c7`, `b7b6`, etc.: Advance the king to assist in the mate.

### Best Plan:
Use the queen to restrict the king, bring the knights closer, and use the White king to tighten the noose.

### Best Move Now:
The move **`f6g4+`** is strong because:
- It gives a **check**, forcing the Black king to move.
- It places the knight on g4, which controls key squares like c3, d5, e5, and f6.
- After `b4c3` or `b4a4`, we can follow up with queen and king moves to continue tightening the net.

Thus, the best immediate move is:

```
f6g4+
```

You're absolutely right — the move `f6g4+` is not valid in strict UCI notation because UCI does not includes checks (`+`) or any other suffixes. The correct format for a move in UCI is simply the from-square and to-square, with promotion specified if applicable (e.g., `e7e8q`).

The correct UCI move for moving the knight from f6 to g4 is:

```
f6g4
```

I'll ensure all future responses strictly adhere to this format. Thank you for your patience.

Final move in correct UCI format:

```
f6g4

2025-06-23 05:23:03,826 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 13.48s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/1K6/Q7/8/6N1/1k6/8/6N1 w - - 27 89`

### Position Summary:
- **White is up a queen and a knight.**
- **Black has only a king and one pawn (which is not close to promotion).**
- **White’s king is very active, near the center of the board.**
- **White has a queen on a6 and knights on g4 and g1.**
- **Black’s king is on b3, cornered and vulnerable.**

This is a **completely winning position for White**. The goal now is to deliver checkmate as efficiently as possible.

---

### Strategy:
We want to use the queen and king to box in the black king while using the knights to assist in delivering mate. Since Black has no real counterplay, we just need to be careful not to allow stalemate or let the black king escape.

Currently, the black king is on b3. We can start tightening the net by moving the queen closer or cutting off escape squares.

---

### Candidate Moves:
- `a6a8`: Queen retreats to the back rank – not useful.
- `a6b5`: Threatens immediate check on b4 or c4.
- `a6c6`: Controls more central squares.
- `a6d3`: Checks the black king directly: `a6d3+ Ka2...` – promising.
- `g4e3`: Knight approaches the action – could help deliver mate.
- `g4f6`, `g4h6`: Knights maneuvering.

Let’s evaluate the most forcing move:

#### Best Move: `a6d3+`
- **Check**: Forces the black king to move.
- **Cuts off escape squares** and begins a mating net.
- Follow-up moves can include `Kc6`, `Ne3`, or `Qc4#`.

After `a6d3+`, Black must play `Ka2` or `Kb4`. Either way, White can continue with decisive control.

Then White can follow up with `Kb7-Kb6`, bring in the knights, and deliver mate soon.

---

### Final Decision:
```
a6d3
```

2025-06-23 05:23:18,754 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 12.83s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`3Q4/1K6/8/8/6N1/k7/8/6N1 w - - 31 91`

### Material:
- **White**: Queen (d8), King (b7), Knight (g4, g1)
- **Black**: King (a3)

White is significantly ahead in material with a queen and two knights versus just a lone black king. The white king is very active, sitting on b7, very close to the enemy king.

The black king is on a3, cornered and vulnerable.

### Goal:
With such a material advantage, White should aim for a forced mate. Black cannot promote anything, has no pieces to create counterplay, and is completely overwhelmed.

### Key Observations:
- The black king is trapped on the edge.
- The white queen can deliver checkmate with support from the white king or knights.
- The white king is already dangerously close to the black king — this is ideal for mating patterns.
- The white queen on d8 has many checking squares.

### Candidate Moves:
We must consider queen checks first, as they are likely to lead to a forced mate.

#### 1. `d8a5+`
- Queen moves to a5, checking the black king.
- Black king must move to b3 or b2.
- Follow-up: White can use the king on b7 to help restrict escape squares.
- This seems promising.

#### 2. `d8c7+`
- Queen to c7, giving check.
- Black king can go to b2 or b3.
- Again, white can follow up with Kb6 or Kb7 to tighten the net.

#### 3. `d8b6+`
- Queen gives check on b6.
- Black king goes to a4 or a2.
- White can respond with Kb8 or Kb7 depending on reply.

#### 4. `d8e7+`
- Queen checks on e7.
- Black king to b4 or b3.
- White king can advance to b6 or b7.

All of these queen checks seem viable, but we want the one that leads most directly to checkmate with minimal risk.

Let’s pick the clearest forcing line:

### Best Move: `d8a5+`

This move places immediate pressure on the black king, limiting its movement to only two squares (b3 or b2). It also keeps the queen on a file that allows coordination with the white king on b7 and possibly the knight on g4.

#### Tactical Line Example:
1. `d8a5+` Kb3  
2. Kb7 Kb2  
3. Qb4+ Kc2  
4. Qc4+ Kb2  
5. Nb6 Kb1  
6. Qb3#

This is a typical queen-and-king mate with assistance from a knight.

Thus, the best move here is:

```
d8a5
```

Let's analyze the position carefully and determine the best move.

### FEN Position:
```
8/1K6/8/Q7/6N1/1k6/8/6N1 w - - 33 92
```

This is a **very late endgame** with minimal material. White has:

- King on b7  
- Queen on a5  
- Knights on g4 and g1  

Black has:

- King on b3  

White is up by a queen and two knights versus nothing — a massive material advantage. Black’s only piece was just captured (from move history), and now it's a pure technical win for White assuming correct play.

The goal here is to deliver checkmate, and we must be careful not to stalemate the opponent.

---

### Step-by-step Analysis:

We need to drive the black king into a corner and deliver mate. The black king is currently on **b3**, which is already quite restricted.

White should aim to control escape squares and gradually reduce black king mobility.

#### Candidate Moves:

1. **Qa5-b5+** – Checks the black king and restricts it further.
2. **Qa5-a6+** – Also checks but allows more space.
3. **Qa5-c5+** – Similar idea.
4. **Kb7-c6** – Advances the king, but may give the black king room to maneuver.
5. **Qa5-d5+** – Another checking option.

Let’s evaluate the most forcing line starting with **Qb5+**.

---

### Move: `Qb5+` (uci: `a5b5`)

After `a5b5+`, black king must go to **a3** or **a4**.

#### Line 1: `... Kb3-a3`

Then continue with:

- `Qa5-c3+` (check, forces Kb1-style moves)
- Followed by `Kb7-c6` or `Kb7-a6`, tightening the net.

Eventually, bring in the knights to assist in delivering checkmate.

This line leads to a forced mate in several moves.

---

### Conclusion:

The best move is to start with a **queen check** that limits black’s options and begins the mating sequence.

The most precise and effective way to begin is:

```
a5b5
```

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN Position:
```
8/1K6/8/1Q6/6N1/8/2k5/6N1 w - - 35 93
```

This is a late endgame with very few pieces on the board. White has a queen, two knights, and a king. Black has only a king and a pawn (which is dangerously advanced). The key features of this position:

- **White King** is on b7.
- **White Queen** is on b5.
- **Black King** is on c2, very close to promoting its pawn (on c2, so it’s about to become a queen).
- There is a black pawn on c2 that is one move away from queening.
- White must act quickly to prevent the black pawn from promoting or deliver checkmate before Black can make use of its new queen.

### Immediate Threat:
The black pawn on c2 can promote on Black's next move unless stopped. If it promotes, Black will have a new queen and likely win the game unless White can deliver mate first.

### Goal:
White must **prevent promotion**, ideally by capturing the pawn or blocking it, while simultaneously threatening checkmate.

### Candidate Moves:
We need to stop the pawn from promoting. Let's look at possible moves:

#### 1. **Queen moves to threaten c2:**
- **b5-c4**: threatens c2 but allows Black to play Kxc2.
- **b5-b2**: attacks c2 directly and threatens to capture the pawn before it promotes.
    - This looks promising.

#### 2. **King moves:**
- King is too far from c2 to help in time.

#### 3. **Knight moves:**
- Knights are not in range to influence c2 in one move.

### Best Move:
**b5-b2**

- This move attacks the c2 pawn directly.
- It prevents Black from playing c1=Q without being captured immediately by the queen.
- It also puts pressure on the second rank and supports potential mating patterns with the king and queen.

If Black responds with **Kxb2**, then White plays **Kb7-b6**, and the game remains in White's control due to opposition and proximity to promotion.

Thus, the best move here is:

```
b5b2
```

Let's analyze the position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/1K6/8/8/6N1/8/1Q6/3k2N1 w - - 37 94`

This is a late endgame with very few pieces on the board. White has:

- King on b7
- Queen on b2
- Knight on g4 and Knight on g1

Black has:

- King on d1

White is up by a queen and two knights versus a lone king. The only danger here is stalemate or a blunder that allows Black to draw.

The key goal for White is to deliver checkmate, most likely using the queen and king in coordination, possibly supported by a knight.

### Key Observations:

- Black’s king is trapped in the lower half of the board (rank 1), but not yet cornered.
- White’s king is on b7 – close to the action and can help restrict Black’s king.
- The queen is on b2 – well placed for delivering mate along the 2nd rank or diagonally.
- There are many knight moves available, but they don’t seem immediately decisive unless they assist in tightening the net around d1.

### Candidate Moves:

#### King Moves:
- **b7c8** – walks toward the center, supports queen
- **b7a8** – retreats, seems passive
- **b7c7** – keeps pressure, centralizes king slightly

#### Queen Moves:
- **b2h8** – threatens mate on h1/h2
- **b2g7** – controls long diagonal, pressures g7–g1
- **b2f6** – less effective
- **b2e5**, **b2b6**, etc. – mostly lateral moves without immediate threat

#### Knight Moves:
Most knight moves are non-forcing and do not contribute directly to mating net.

---

### Best Plan:
Use the queen and king together to drive the black king to the edge or corner.

Currently, Black’s king is on **d1**, and the white queen on **b2** already covers c3, e2, and d2. The white king on **b7** can walk into c7 or c8 to further restrict movement.

A strong move is:

### `b2h8`

This places the queen on the back rank, eyeing the escape square h1. It also prepares a potential mate on h2 if the king is forced to e1 or f1.

From h8, the queen controls the entire 8th rank and can pivot quickly to deliver mate with support from the king or a knight.

After this move, depending on Black's reply, White can follow up with precise king or knight moves to tighten the noose.

---

### Final Move:
```
b2h8
```

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN Position:
```
7Q/1K6/8/8/6N1/8/2k5/6N1 w - - 39 95
```

This is a **critical endgame** with White having a queen and two knights (plus king), while Black has only a king. The material advantage is overwhelming for White, and the goal is to deliver checkmate as efficiently as possible.

### Key Observations:

- White’s king is on b7.
- White has a queen on h8.
- Knights are on g4 and g1.
- Black’s king is on c2.
- There are no pawns left on the board.
- Black cannot promote anything or create counterplay.
- This is essentially a "checkmate with queen and knights" scenario.

### Strategy:

Given that White has a massive material advantage, we should aim for a forced mate in as few moves as possible. Since Black can't resist much, the idea is to corner the black king using the queen and support from the knights and king.

We must be careful not to stalemate the black king by mistake — always ensure that Black has at least one legal move until the final checkmate.

### Candidate Moves:

From the list of legal moves, we want to bring the queen closer to the black king on **c2**, ideally to restrict its mobility further.

The most effective move here is:

- **Qh8-b8+**

#### Why Qb8?

- It checks the black king.
- Forces the black king to move to d1 or d2.
- Prepares for a quick mate pattern with the queen and white king working together.
- Keeps all other pieces ready to assist.

After **Qb8**, depending on Black's reply, White can follow up with Kb7-b6 or Kb7-c7, and bring in the knights if needed, but likely won’t need them.

White to move. The material is completely equal (Queen + King + Knight vs. lone King), but White has a **very strong position** with the queen and king already in striking distance of Black's king.

Black’s king is trapped on the edge of the board, and White can deliver mate in a few moves if played correctly.

---

## Goal: Deliver checkmate as efficiently as possible.

We must restrict the black king’s escape while coordinating our queen and king.

Currently, the black king is on **a1**, and the white queen is on **b8**. The white king is on **b7**, very close to the action.

Let’s evaluate key candidate moves:

### Candidate Moves:

#### 1. `b8h2+` – Queen to h2, checking the black king and threatening mate on h1.
- After `b8h2+`, Black must move to `a2`.
- Then we can play `b7c7`, tightening the net.
- Followed by `g1h3` or `g4e3`, supporting a final mating pattern.

This line looks promising and leads to forced mate.

Let’s test it:

1. `b8h2+` Kb1-a2  
2. `b7c7` Ka2-a3  
3. `g1h3` Ka3-a4  
4. `g4e3` Ka4-a5  
5. `h2b2#` – Mate!

Yes, this works.

Other queen moves like `b8a7` or `b8a8` are also good, but they give the black king more room and may allow stalemate tricks.

The most direct and forcing path is **`b8h2+`**, which limits Black’s options and keeps the initiative.

Let's analyze the position carefully.

### Current FEN:
```
8/1K6/8/8/6N1/8/7Q/k5N1 w - - 43 97
```

### Material:
- **White:** King on b7, Queen on h2, Knight on g4, Knight on g1
- **Black:** King on a1

### Observations:
- The Black king is trapped in the corner (a1), which is a prime setup for a back-rank or smothered mate.
- White has a queen and two knights, with the king nearby. This is a classic setup for a mating net.
- The White king is on b7, which is quite close to the action near a1.
- The White queen is on h2 — this controls the long diagonal leading toward a1 if supported properly.
- Knights are on g4 and g1 — both are active and can jump into key squares like e3, f3, or e5.

### Goal:
Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible. There may be a forced mate in 1 or 2 moves.

---

### Candidate Moves:

#### 1. **Qh2e5+**
- Checks the king.
- Controls b8 and d6, putting pressure on the back rank.
- May force the Black king into a smothered position.

But Black could respond with Ka1-b1 (if not blocked).

#### 2. **Qh2a2#**
- Immediate checkmate if legal!
- Let’s verify:
    - From h2 to a2 is a valid queen move.
    - Is the square a2 attacked by White?
    - Yes: Q controls the a2 square.
    - Is the Black king boxed in? Yes — no escape squares.
    - Does a2 deliver checkmate?

Let’s visualize:

- **Ka1**
- **Qa2** would mean the king is in check and has **no legal moves**.
- No friendly pieces blocking the queen’s path.
- Therefore, **Qa2 is checkmate**!

This is likely the fastest way to win.

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/1K6/8/8/6N1/8/k7/6N1 w - - 0 98`

### Board Position:
```
........
........
........
........
......N.
........
........
.N....k.
```

White has a king on b7, a knight on g4, and another knight on g1.  
Black has a king on a2 and no other pieces.

### Goal:
Since Black has only a king, White must aim for checkmate or force a win by capturing any remaining black piece (but in this case, there are none). Therefore, the goal is to corner the black king and deliver checkmate.

### Observations:
- The white king is on b7, quite centralized and active.
- The black king is on a2, stuck near the edge.
- White has two knights (on g4 and g1), giving maximum flexibility.
- Knights thrive in closed positions and can deliver mate if the black king is restricted.
- The black king is currently very limited in mobility but not yet in checkmate.

### Strategy:
We need to maneuver our pieces to restrict the black king further and eventually deliver checkmate. Since knights alone cannot mate a lone king without help, we must use the white king actively.

The ideal plan is to bring the white king closer to a2 while coordinating with the knights to cut off escape squares.

### Candidate Moves:
Let’s evaluate each legal move:

#### King moves:
- **b7c8**, **b7a8**, **b7c7**, **b7a7**, **b7c6**, **b7b6**, **b7a6** – These all move the king toward the center or toward the black king. The most logical is **b7a7** or **b7a6**, bringing it closer to a2.

#### Knight on g4:
- **g4h6**, **g4f6**, **g4e5**, **g4e3**, **g4h2**, **g4f2** – These target squares around the black king. **g4f2** heads directly toward f2, which is adjacent to a2 — promising.

#### Knight on g1:
- **g1h3**, **g1f3**, **g1e2** – Again, trying to get into a position to assist in restricting the black king.

### Best Plan:
Move the white king closer to a2 and prepare to support the knights. A strong candidate is **b7a7**, reducing the space of the black king even more.

From a7, the white king can later go to a6 or b6, continuing to squeeze the black king toward the corner.

Also, after **b7a7**, we can follow up with **g4f2** or **g1e2**, putting pressure directly on the black king.

### Final Move:
```
b7a7
```

```

### Material:
- White: King on a7, Knight on g4, Knight on g1
- Black: King on a1

### Observations:
- The position is extremely simplified.
- White has two knights and a king; black only has a king.
- There are **no pawns** left.
- Checkmate can be forced with optimal play due to the two knights, but it’s notoriously difficult and requires precise technique.
- However, **White must avoid a draw by insufficient material or 50-move rule** (which is close here — move 99).
- Black cannot currently make any moves — it's their turn, but they have no legal moves unless White makes a move that gives them options.

### Goal:
Since Black has no legal moves right now, if it were truly Black's turn, it would be **stalemate**. But since it's **White's move**, we must choose a move that maintains control and **avoids stalemate**, while trying to **force checkmate** in the fewest moves possible.

### Candidate Moves:
We must consider which of these moves help us achieve checkmate:

Legal moves:
- `a7b8`, `a7a8`, `a7b7`, `a7b6`, `a7a6` – king moves
- `g4h6`, `g4f6`, `g4e5`, `g4e3`, `g4h2`, `g4f2` – knight from g4
- `g1h3`, `g1f3`, `g1e2` – knight from g1

### Plan:
- We want to bring the knights closer to the black king to assist in checkmating.
- The white king should stay near the center or support the mating net.
- Avoiding unnecessary king moves unless they aid in cornering the black king.
- The ideal plan is to drive the black king to a corner (like a1) and deliver checkmate using both knights and the king.

### Best Move:
The most active and useful move is **`g4e3`**, bringing the knight from g4 to e3, which supports future squares like c2 and d1, where we can potentially corner the black king.

This move keeps the king boxed in the a1 corner and begins the process of tightening the noose for a forced mate.

```
g4e3

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/K7/8/8/8/4N3/1k6/6N1 w - - 4 100`

This is a late-endgame position with minimal material. White has a king on a7, a knight on e3, and another knight on g1. Black has only a king on b2.

White to move.

### Goal:
We must find the best move for White. The goal is to drive the black king into a corner and deliver checkmate, as this is a theoretical win for White with precise play (King + Two Knights vs King).

### Key Observations:
- Black’s king is on b2.
- White’s king is on a7 — quite far from the action.
- One white knight is on e3, which is relatively active.
- The other white knight is on g1 — very passive.
- We need to coordinate both knights and the king to corner the black king.

### Candidate Moves:
From the list of legal moves:

- **a7-b8**: King forward!
- **a7-a8**, **a7-b7**, **a7-b6**, **a7-a6**: Other king moves
- **e3-f5**, **e3-d5**, **e3-g4**, **e3-c4**, **e3-g2**, **e3-c2**, **e3-f1**, **e3-d1**: Knight maneuvers
- **g1-h3**, **g1-f3**, **g1-e2**: Activating the inactive knight

### Plan:
The ideal plan is to bring the king closer while coordinating the two knights to restrict and eventually corner the black king.

**Best immediate move: `a7b8`**

Why?
- This brings the white king closer to the center and into a more active role.
- From b8, it can later support the knights in driving the black king toward the corner.
- It avoids moving the knights too early before the king is better centralized.

Let’s execute that now.

2025-06-23 05:25:17,104 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
