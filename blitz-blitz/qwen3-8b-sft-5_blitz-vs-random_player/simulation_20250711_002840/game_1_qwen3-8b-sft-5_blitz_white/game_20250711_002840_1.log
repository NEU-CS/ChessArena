2025-07-11 00:38:36,861 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-5_blitz) (took 581.88s):
Let's analyze the position:

- It's the starting position (FEN shows no pieces moved yet).
- White has the first move.
- The most common and principled opening moves are:
    - Nf3 (g1f3): Develops a knight, attacks the center, and prepares for castling.
    - Nc3 (b1c3): Develops a knight, supports the center, but less flexible than Nf3.
    - d4/d3/e4/etc.: Pawn moves that control the center, but Nf3 is more flexible and develops a piece.

Candidate moves:
1. g1f3 (Nf3): Most natural, develops a piece, attacks the center, and keeps options open.
2. b1c3 (Nc3): Also good, but slightly less flexible than Nf3.
3. e2e4 (e4): Claims space in the center, but leaves the king vulnerable without development.
4. Other pawn moves: Less ambitious, don't develop pieces.

Best move:
- Nf3 is the most principled, developing a piece, attacking the center, and preparing for kingside castling.

Final move:
```
g1f3
```
