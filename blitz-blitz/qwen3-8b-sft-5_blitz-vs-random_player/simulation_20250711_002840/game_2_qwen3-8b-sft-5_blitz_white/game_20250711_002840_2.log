2025-07-11 10:27:04,472 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-5_blitz) (took 468.75s):
Let's analyze the current position:

- It's the starting position (FEN shows no pieces moved yet).
- White has the first move.
- The most common and principled opening moves are Nf3, Nc3, d4, e4, etc.

Candidate moves:
1. Nf3 (g1f3): Develops a knight, attacks the e5 square, prepares castling.
2. Nc3 (b1c3): Develops a knight, supports d5 and e4 squares.
3. d4 (d2d4): Immediate central pawn break, opens lines.
4. e4 (e2e4): Another central pawn break, controls more space.
5. Other pawn moves (like f4, g4, etc.) are less flexible and commit pawns early without development.

Best move considerations:
- Nf3 is the most classical and flexible, developing a piece and preparing to castle.
- d4 or e4 are also strong, but they commit to a specific pawn structure immediately.
- Developing knights first is generally preferred in the opening to control the center indirectly.

Conclusion:  
The best move is to develop the knight to f3, which is the most standard and flexible choice in this position.
