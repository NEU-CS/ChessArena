Let's analyze the position.

This is the starting position of chess. As White, I have the first move. The opening move is critical for establishing control of the center, developing pieces, and preparing for king safety (castling).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e2e4** – Opens lines for the queen and bishop, controls the center. Most popular and aggressive.
2. **d2d4** – Also controls the center, opens the bishop.
3. **c2c4** – English Opening, controls d5, but less direct than e4/d4.
4. **Nf3 (g1f3)** – Develops a knight, controls e5/d4, but does not immediately contest the center with a pawn.
5. **Nc3 (b1c3)** – Develops a knight, but less flexible than Nf3.

**Analysis:**
- **e4** and **d4** are the most principled moves, directly contesting the center.
- **e4** is slightly more aggressive, and leads to a wide variety of open games, giving White good chances for an advantage.
- **d4** is also strong, but often leads to more closed positions.
- **Nf3** is flexible, but less ambitious as a first move.

Given the need for both long-term strategic advantage and short-term tactical possibilities, **e2e4** is the best move. It maximizes central control, opens lines for rapid development, and keeps all options open.

My move is:
```
e2e4
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2  
**Move history:** 1. e4 e5

**It's White to move.**

**Position:**  
- Both sides have played their king's pawn two squares.
- No pieces developed yet.
- No immediate threats from Black.
- White has a wide range of opening choices.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf3** (g1f3): Classical development, attacks e5, prepares kingside castling, controls the center.
2. **Nc3** (b1c3): Develops a piece, supports e4, but less direct than Nf3.
3. **Bc4** (f1c4): Italian Game, develops bishop, eyes f7, but Nf3 is usually played first.
4. **Bb5** (f1b5): Ruy Lopez, but again, Nf3 is usually played first.
5. **d4** (d2d4): Immediate central break, but after exd4, Qxd4, Black gets tempo with Nc6.
6. Other pawn moves (c3, d3, etc.) are more passive.

**Analysis:**
- **Nf3** is the most principled move, attacking e5, developing a piece, and preparing to castle.
- **Nc3** is also playable, but less ambitious.
- **Bc4** and **Bb5** are fine, but usually played after Nf3 to avoid ...Nf6 with tempo.
- **d4** is playable, but can lead to early queen development, which is not ideal.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is **Nf3** (g1f3), following classical opening principles: develop a piece, attack the center, and prepare to castle.

**Final move:**
```
g1f3
```

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3

White to move.

**Material:** Equal  
**Development:** Both sides have developed one knight; Black has played ...e5 and ...Nf6.  
**Center:** Both sides have a pawn in the center.  
**King safety:** Both kings are safe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxe5**: Captures the e5 pawn. If Black responds with ...Qe7, White can play d4, defending the knight and gaining space. If ...Nxe4, White can play Qe2, regaining the piece.
2. **Nc3**: Develops a piece, supports e4, and prepares for d4.
3. **Bc4**: Develops a piece, eyes f7, and prepares to castle.
4. **d4**: Immediately challenges the center, but Black can respond with ...exd4, and after Nxd4, Nxe4, White must be careful.
5. **Bb5**: Pins the knight, but doesn't threaten much yet.

**Let's analyze Nxe5 in detail:**

1. Nxe5 Nxe4 (if Black tries to win a pawn)
   - Qe2 d5 (if ...Qe7, d4 is strong)
   - d3 Qe7 dxe4 Qxe5 exd5 Qxe2+ Bxe2
   - White is fine, with a slight lead in development.

Alternatively, after 1. Nxe5 Qe7 2. d4 d6 3. Nf3 Nxe4 4. Be2, White is comfortable.

**Nxe5 is the most ambitious move, grabbing a central pawn.**

**Other moves (Nc3, Bc4, d4) are more positional and less ambitious.**

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play Nxe5, grabbing the pawn and challenging Black to prove compensation.

Final move:

2025-06-11 21:13:06,042 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.86s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4  
**White to move.**

**Move history:**  
1. e4 e5  
2. Nf3 Nf6  
3. Nxe5 Qe7

**Current position:**  
- Black has just played Qe7, attacking the knight on e5.
- White's knight on e5 is attacked, but Black's kingside is undeveloped.
- White has a lead in development and the initiative.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxf7** — Forks queen and rook, but after ...Kxf7, White can play Bc4+ and get a strong attack.
2. **d4** — Defends the knight, but Black can play d6, attacking the knight again.
3. **Nc3** — Develops, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.
4. **d3** — Defends the knight, but is passive.
5. **Qe2** — Defends the knight, but blocks the bishop.
6. **f4** — Defends the knight, but weakens the kingside.

**Tactical calculation for Nxf7:**
- 4. Nxf7 Kxf7
- 5. Bc4+ d5 (forced, otherwise Qh5+ is devastating)
- 6. Bxd5+ Nxd5
- 7. Qh5+ g6
- 8. Qxd5+ Be6
- 9. Qxb7

White wins at least a pawn, and Black's king is exposed.

Alternatively, after 4. Nxf7, if Black does not take, White is simply up a pawn and threatens Nxh8.

**Conclusion:**  
Nxf7 is a classic tactical shot in this line, known as the "Fried Liver Attack" motif, and is the strongest move. It wins material and exposes the Black king.

**Final move:**
```
e5f7

2025-06-11 21:13:53,790 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.92s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 4...Kxf7:**

- White: King e1, Queen d1, Rooks a1/h1, Bishops c1/f1, Knights b1, Pawns a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black: King f7, Queen e7, Rooks a8/h8, Bishops c8/f8, Knight f6, Pawns a7, b7, c7, d7, e5, g7, h7

**Material:**
- White is up a pawn (having captured on f7).
- Black's king is exposed on f7, and White has a significant lead in development and attacking chances.

**Key factors:**
- Black's king is on f7, uncastled and exposed.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped.
- White can develop with tempo and threaten checks or pins.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bc4+** (f1c4): Develops with check, forces Black to respond, possibly with d5 or Kg6/Ke8.
2. **Qh5+** (d1h5): Direct check, but g6 is available.
3. **Nc3** (b1c3): Develops, but not forcing.
4. **d4** (d2d4): Opens the center, but not as forcing as a check.
5. **Bb5** (f1b5): Develops, but not as forcing as Bc4+.

**Analysis of Bc4+:**

- 5. Bc4+ d5 (forced, otherwise Kg6/Ke8 is awkward)
- 6. exd5 Qc5 (only move to defend, but then White can play d3 or Bb3)
- Alternatively, after 5. Bc4+ Ke8, White can play Nc3, d4, or Qh5+.

**Analysis of Qh5+:**

- 5. Qh5+ g6 6. Qf3 (threatening Bc4+ and d4), but Black can play Nc6 or Kg7.

**Conclusion:**

**Bc4+** is the most forcing move, develops a piece with tempo, and keeps Black's king in the center. It is the best move to press the advantage and go for a swift attack.

My move is:

2025-06-11 21:14:30,541 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.59s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb2b1r/ppppq1pp/5nk1/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 2 6

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 8 pawns, king (no knights)
- Black: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 8 pawns, king (no knights)

**Key features:**
- Black's king is on g6, exposed and vulnerable.
- Black's queen is on e7, not defending the king.
- White's bishop is on c4, eyeing the g8 square.
- White's queen is on d1, can swing to h5 or g4 for a check.
- White can castle kingside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qh5+** (d1h5): Immediate check, forcing ...Nxh5 (but there is no knight), or ...Kxh5 (illegal), so only ...Kf6 or ...Kg5. But after Qh5+, Kxh5 is illegal, so only Kf6 or Kf7. But g6 is occupied by the king. Let's check the possible responses.
2. **Bg8** (c4g8): Bishop check, only move is Nxg8 (but Black has no knight), so only Rxg8, but Black's rook is on h8, so can't capture. King can't move to h6, h7, f7, f6, f5, so this is checkmate.
3. **Qf3** (d1f3): Threatening Qf5# (but f5 is covered by Black's pawn on e4).
4. **Qe2** (d1e2): Not a check, but develops.
5. **Castling** (e1g1): Not urgent, as Black's king is exposed.

**Critical calculation:**
- **Bg8 (c4g8)**: Is this checkmate?
  - King on g6, bishop on g8, Black's only legal moves are:
    - h7-h6 (but doesn't block the check)
    - g7-g6 (but pawn is on g7, so can't move)
    - f7-f6 (but pawn is on f7, so can't move)
    - No piece can block on g8.
    - King can't move to h6 (blocked by pawn), h7 (blocked by pawn), f7 (blocked by pawn), f6 (blocked by queen), f5 (blocked by pawn), h5 (off the board).
    - So **Bg8 is checkmate**.

**Conclusion:** The move **c4g8** (Bg8#) is checkmate.

**Final move:**
```
c4g8

2025-06-11 21:15:25,045 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.33s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Position after Black's last move (11...Ng8):**

- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Bishop on c1, Knights are gone, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on g6, Queen on e7, Bishop on f8 and c8, Knight on g8, Rooks on a8 and h8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g7, h7, e5 is gone.

**Material:**
- White is up a full piece (White captured a rook for a bishop and knight, and Black's king is exposed).
- Black's king is on g6, very exposed.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped.
- White's development is behind, but White has a huge initiative.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qg4+ — Immediate check, attacks the king, forces h5 or Kf7.
2. Qh5+ — Immediate check, forces Kf6 or Kf7.
3. d4 — Opens the center, but not urgent.
4. Nc3 — Develops, but not urgent.
5. O-O — Castles, but not urgent.
6. f4 — Prepares f5, but not urgent.

**Let's analyze the checks:**

**1. Qg4+**
- If ...Kh6, then d3-d4 with threats.
- If ...Kf6, then Qf5# is mate.
- If ...Kh7, then Qh5# is mate.
- If ...Qg5, then h4 wins the queen.

But after Qg4+, Black can only block with Qg5 or move the king.

**2. Qh5+**
- If ...Kf6, then Qf5# is mate.
- If ...Kf7, then Qf5+ and then Qf7#.
- If ...Kh7, then Qh7# is mate.

**But let's check Qg4+ in detail:**
- Qg4+ Kh6 (only move)
- d3-d4 (threatening d4-d5+)
- But is there a forced mate? Let's check Qh5+.

**Qh5+**
- If ...Kf6, Qf5# is mate.
- If ...Kf7, Qf5+ Kg8 Qf7# is mate.
- If ...Kh7, Qh7# is mate.

**So Qh5+ is a forced mate in 2 or 3.**

**Let's check for any defense:**
- Qh5+ Kf6 Qf5# (mate)
- Qh5+ Kf7 Qf5+ Kg8 Qf7# (mate)
- Qh5+ Kh7 Qh7# (mate)

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```

2025-06-11 21:15:48,275 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.69s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb2bnr/ppppq1pp/5k2/7Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 8

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White: Queen (h5), King (e1), Rooks (a1, h1), pawns (a2-h2), minor pieces undeveloped.
- Black: Queen (e7), King (f6), Rooks (a8, h8), minor pieces undeveloped, pawns (a7-h7).

**King safety:** Black's king is extremely exposed on f6, White's queen is on h5, ready to attack. Black's king is vulnerable to checks and mating nets.

**Candidate moves:**
- h5f5+ (Qf5+): Check, forcing the king to e7 or mate if possible.
- h5h7: Threatening Qxh7, but not check.
- h5e8: Check, but Black can block with ...Qe8.
- h5f7: Check, but Black can take with ...Qxf7.
- h5g6: Check, but Black can take with ...hxg6.
- h5g5: Check, but Black can play ...Kxg5.
- h5e5+: Check, but Black can block with ...Qxe5.

Let's look at the most forcing moves: **checks**.

1. **h5f5+ (Qf5+)**
   - Black's only legal move is+ Kg5 (since the pawn on g7 is pinned and can't block, and the king can't go to e7 or g7).
   - After Kg5, White can play d4+ (discover check with the pawn), and the king is forced to h4 or h6.
   - This looks promising.

2. **h5e8+ (Qe8+)**
   - Black can block with ...Qe8, trading queens, which is not ideal for White.

3. **h5f7+ (Qf7+)**
   - Black can capture with ...Qxf7.

4. **h5g6+ (Qg6+)**
   - Black can capture with ...hxg6.

5. **h5g5+ (Qg5+)**
   - Black can capture with ...Kxg5.

**So, h5f5+ is the most promising. Let's check the line:**

- 1. Qf5+ Kg5 (forced)
- 2. d4+ (pawn check)
  - If ...Kh4, then g3# is mate.
  - If ...Kh6, then Qg5# is mate.

**Let's check this:**
- 1. Qf5+ Kg5
- 2. d4+ Kh4
- 3. g3#

**Therefore, h5f5+ leads to a forced mate in 3.**

**Final move:**
```
h5f5
```
