2025-06-11 20:57:11,163 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.14s):
The position is the starting position of chess. As White, I have the first move, and all options are open.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e2e4** – The most popular opening move. Controls the center, opens lines for the queen and bishop, and leads to open, tactical games. Statistically strong.
2. **d2d4** – Also controls the center, opens the bishop, and leads to more positional games.
3. **c2c4** – The English Opening. Controls the center indirectly, but less direct than e4/d4.
4. **Nf3 (g1f3)** – Develops a knight, controls the center, flexible.
5. **Other pawn moves (c3, f4, etc.)** – Less common, less direct control of the center.

**Analysis:**
- e4 and d4 are the most principled, controlling the center and opening lines for development.
- e4 is slightly more aggressive and leads to more open positions, which is often preferable in a must-win or urgent situation.
- d4 is solid, but can lead to more closed positions.
- Nf3 is flexible, but does not claim the center as forcefully as e4/d4.

**Conclusion:**
Given the need for maximum winning chances, central control, and rapid development, **e2e4** is the best move.

2025-06-11 20:57:58,878 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.81s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 1. e4 e5:**

- White to move.
- Standard opening position, except both sides have played e4/e5.
- No pieces developed yet.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf3** (g1f3): The most classical and principled move, attacking the e5 pawn, developing a piece, and preparing to castle.
2. **Nc3** (b1c3): Develops a piece, but does not attack e5 directly.
3. **Bc4** (f1c4): Develops a piece, eyes f7, but does not contest the center as directly as Nf3.
4. **d4** (d2d4): The Center Game, immediately challenging the center, but after exd4, White must be ready to recapture with the queen or knight.
5. **f4** (f2f4): The King's Gambit, a sharp and aggressive opening, but riskier and less solid than Nf3.

**Evaluation:**
- **Nf3** is the most solid, classical, and flexible move. It develops a piece, attacks e5, and prepares to castle. It is the main line for a reason.
- **d4** is playable, but after exd4, White has to decide between Qxd4 (early queen development) or Nf3 (Göring Gambit or Scotch Game).
- **Bc4** is playable, but less challenging than Nf3.
- **f4** is very aggressive, but risky.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- In a critically urgent match, the best approach is to play solid, classical chess, minimizing risk and maximizing control.
- Nf3 is the move that gives White the best chances for an advantage and keeps all options open.

**Final Decision:**
The best move is:
```
g1f3

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3

White to move.

**Material:** Equal  
**Development:** Both sides have developed one knight.  
**Center:** Both sides have a pawn on e4/e5.  
**King Safety:** Both kings are safe.  
**Threats:** Black is not directly threatening anything, but has developed the knight to f6, attacking e4.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxe5**: Captures the e5 pawn. If Black responds with Qe7, White can play d4, defending the knight and gaining space. If Black plays Nxe4, White can play Qe2, regaining the piece.
2. **Nc3**: Develops a piece, defends e4.
3. **d4**: Immediately challenges the center, but e4 is not defended enough.
4. **Bc4**: Develops a piece, targets f7.
5. **Bb5**: Pins the knight on c6 if it appears, but currently not very effective.
6. **h3**: Prevents Bg4, but not urgent.
7. **g3**: Prepares Bg2, but not urgent.

**Deep analysis of Nxe5:**
- 3. Nxe5 Qe7 4. d4 d6 5. Nf3 Nxe4 6. Be2 (or Qe2) and White is fine.
- 3. Nxe5 Nxe4? 4. Qe2 d5 5. d3 and White regains the piece.

**Deep analysis of Nc3:**
- 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Bb5 (or Bc4) and White has a standard development.

**Deep analysis of d4:**
- 3. d4 Nxe4 4. Nxe5 d6 5. Nf3 and White is fine, but less clear.

**Conclusion:**  
The move **Nxe5** wins a central pawn and, after best play, White keeps the advantage. The tactics work in White's favor.

**Final move:**

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/4P1n1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4

White to move.

**Material:** Equal.

**Position:**
- Black's knight on g4 is aggressively placed, but not supported.
- White's knight on e5 is deep in enemy territory, but not attacked.
- Black's kingside is undeveloped, and the bishop on f8 is blocked.
- White can develop quickly and has some initiative.

**Tactical considerations:**
- The knight on g4 is attacking f2, but there is no immediate threat.
- White can play Qxg4, but the queen is not on d1 yet.
- White can play Nxg4, but the knight is on e5, so that's not possible.
- White can play Nxf7, forking the queen and rook, but after Kxf7, White has no immediate follow-up and is down a knight for a pawn and some initiative.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxf7**: Forks queen and rook, but after Kxf7, White has no immediate follow-up. Black's king is exposed, but White is down a piece for a pawn.
2. **Qxg4**: Not possible, as the queen is on d1.
3. **Nxg4**: Not possible, as the knight is on e5.
4. **d4**: Gains space in the center, but does not address the knight on g4.
5. **h3**: Attacks the knight on g4, forcing it to move or exchange.
6. **Bishop development (Bc4, Bb5, Ba6)**: Develops pieces, but does not address the knight on g4.
7. **f4**: Attacks the knight on g4, but weakens the king's side.

**Critical move:**
- **h3** is the most logical move. It attacks the knight on g4, forcing it to decide. If Black plays Nxe5, then hxg4 wins a piece. If Black retreats, White gains space and time.

**Tactical check:**
- After h3, if Black plays Nxe5, hxg4, White wins a piece.
- If Black plays Nf6, White can continue development with Nc3 or d4.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is **h3**, attacking the knight and gaining time.

Correction: The move must be in UCI notation, not algebraic. Let's check the legal UCI moves again.

Legal moves:
e5f7, e5d7, e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3, h1h2, h1g1, f1a6, f1b5, f1c4, f1d3, f1e2, e1e2, d1g4, d1f3, d1e2, b1c3, b1a3, h3g4, g2g3, d2d3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, d2d4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4

The only move that stops mate is:
g2g3 (attacks the queen, blocks mate)

So the correct move is:

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/4P2q/4n1PP/PPPP1P2/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6

**Black's last move:** ...Ne3 (forking queen and rook, threatening Qxe4+ next move, and also threatening Nxd1)

**White to move.**

### Material Count
- White: Down the exchange (rook for knight), but Black's queen and knight are very active.
- Black: Has a queen on h4, knight on e3 (deep in White's position), but king is still in the center and development is lagging.

### Threats
- Black threatens: 
  - Nxd1 (winning the rook)
  - Qxe4+ (if White moves the knight)
- White can play:
  - Nf3 (attacking the queen)
  - Qf3 (attacking the queen)
  - dxe3 (removing the knight)
  - gxh4 (removing the queen, but only if the knight moves)
- White can also consider Nf7+ (forking king and rook), but after Kxf7, White has no immediate follow-up and is down material.

### Candidate Moves

#### 1. dxe3
- Removes the knight, but allows Qxe4, attacking the rook and threatening mate on h1.
- After dxe3 Qxe4, White can play Rg1, but Black is up material and White's king is exposed.

#### 2. Nf3
- Attacks the queen, but the queen can just take e4 with check: Qxe4+.
- After Qxe4+, White can block with Qe2 or Be2, but Black is still better.

#### 3. Qe2
- Defends the rook and attacks the knight.
- After Qe2 Nxc2+, White can play Kd1, but the king is exposed.

#### 4. Nf7
- Nf7+ Kxf7, White can try Qf3+ (forking king and knight), but after Ke8, White is down material.

#### 5. Qf3
- Attacks the queen, but after Qf3 Qe7, Black is safe.

#### 6. gxh4
- Not possible, as the knight is blocking.

#### 7. d4
- Not possible, as the queen is on d1.

#### 8. Qg4
- Not possible, as the queen is on d1.

#### 9. Qe2
- Defends the rook and attacks the knight.

Let's look at **Qe2** more closely:

- Qe2 defends the rook on h1 and attacks the knight on e3.
- If Black plays Nxc2+, White can play Kd1, and after Nxa1, Qxe5+ wins the bishop on h8.
- Alternatively, after Qe2, if Black plays Qxe4, White can play Qxe3, and the queens are off the board.

#### Let's check the line:
1. Qe2 Nxc2+ 2. Kd1 Nxa1 3. Qxe5+ Be7 4. Qxg7 Rf8 5. gxh4

White is down material but has some compensation for the exposed Black king.

#### What about dxe3?
1. dxe3 Qxe4 2. Rg1 Qxe5 3. Nc3

But Black is up material.

#### What about Nf3?
1. Nf3 Qxe4+ 2. Be2 Nxd1 3. Kxd1

White loses the exchange.

#### What about Qf3?
1. Qf3 Qe7 2. Qxe3 Qxe5

Black is up material.

### Best Move

**Qe2** seems to be the best move, as it attacks the knight, defends the rook, and if Black takes on c2+, White can play Kd1 and after Nxa1, Qxe5+ wins the bishop on h8.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
qe2

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/4P3/4n1qP/PPPPQP2/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White is down a piece for a pawn.
- Black's queen is on g3, very active.
- White's king is still in the center, but Black's king is also uncastled.
- White's knight on e5 is advanced and active.
- Black's knight on e3 is very dangerous, attacking the queen and threatening discovered checks.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's knight on e3 attacks the White queen on e2 and threatens discovered checks (e.g., ...Ng2+).
- Black's queen on g3 is very active, eyeing g2 and h3.
- White's queen is attacked and must move or the threat must be parried.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e2e3**: Attacks the knight, but allows ...Ng2+ (forking king and rook), so not good.
2. **e2f3**: Queen captures the knight, but then ...Qxf3, and White is down a queen.
3. **e2e3**: Already considered, loses to ...Ng2+.
4. **e2d3**: Queen moves, but ...Ng2+ is still a threat.
5. **e5f7**: Knight fork, attacking rook and king, but after ...Kxf7, White is still in trouble.
6. **e5g4**: Knight attacks queen, but doesn't solve the threat to the queen.
7. **f2g3**: Pawn captures queen, but then ...Nxc2+ forks king and rook, but White can recapture with queen or bishop.
8. **d2e3**: Pawn captures knight, but then ...Qxe3, and White is down a queen.

**Critical lines:**

- **f2g3**: If White plays f2g3, Black can play ...Nxc2+ (fork), but then White can play Kd1 or Kf2, and after ...Nxa1, White can play Qf3, threatening mate on f7. But Black can defend. Let's see:

    1. f2g3 Nxc2+ (check)
    2. Kd1 Nxa1
    3. Qf3 (threatening Qxf7#)
    4. ...f6 (defends f7)
    5. Bc4 (threatening Qxf6)
    
    But Black is up a rook and a piece.

- **e2e3**: If White plays e2e3, Black plays ...Ng2+ (fork), and after Bxg2, Qxg2, White loses the rook.

- **e5f7+**: If White plays e5f7+, Black plays ...Kxf7, and White is still in trouble.

- **e2h5**: Queen attacks g4, but ...Ng2+ is still a threat.

- **e2f3**: Queen takes knight, but Black plays ...Qxf3, and White is down a queen.

- **e5g4**: Knight attacks queen, but Black can play ...Nxg4, and White is down a piece.

- **e2g4**: Queen takes queen, but Black plays ...Nxg4, and White is down a piece.

- **e2a6**: Queen check, but Black can block with ...Nb8.

**Best move:**

The only way to avoid immediate material loss is to capture the queen:

- **f2g3**: Pawn takes queen. After ...Nxc2+ (fork), White can play Kd1, and after ...Nxa1, White can play Qf3, threatening mate on f7. Black must defend with ...f6, and White can try to build up an attack, but Black is up a rook and a piece.

However, this is the only way to avoid losing the queen or getting mated.

**Final move:**
```

Let's carefully analyze the position.

**FEN:** rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/4P3/6PP/PPPPQ1n1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8

**Move history:**  
1. e2e4 e7e5  
2. g1f3 g8f6  
3. f3e5 f6g4  
4. h2h3 d8h4  
5. g2g3 g4e3  
6. d1e2 h4g3  
7. f2g3 e3g2

**White to move. Legal moves:**  
- e1f2 (King to f2)
- e1d1 (King to d1)
- e2g2 (Queen captures knight on g2)
- f1g2 (Bishop captures knight on g2)

Let's evaluate each move:

---

### 1. e2g2 (Queen takes knight on g2)
- Queen captures the knight, regaining material.
- No immediate threats to White's queen.
- Black cannot check or threaten White immediately.
- White is up a piece (Queen for Knight).
- King remains on e1, castling rights are lost, but White is safe.
- Black has no compensation for the lost piece.

### 2. f1g2 (Bishop takes knight on g2)
- Bishop captures the knight.
- White keeps the queen on e2.
- King remains on e1, can castle kingside in the future.
- However, the queen is more valuable than the bishop, and the queen is not threatened.
- White is still up a piece.

### 3. e1f2 (King to f2)
- King moves to f2.
- No immediate threat, but king is exposed and cannot castle.
- White is not making progress.

### 4. e1d1 (King to d1)
- King moves to d1.
- Same as above, king is exposed, cannot castle.

---

**Best move:**

- Both e2g2 and f1g2 win a piece, but e2g2 is stronger: the queen is not threatened, and White keeps the bishop pair.
- There are no tactics for Black after e2g2; White is simply up a piece.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to capture the knight with the queen.

```

2025-06-11 21:03:14,379 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.32s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen, both rooks, both bishops, knight, 7 pawns
- Black: Rook (on g8), queen is gone, both bishops, both knights are gone, 7 pawns

**King Safety:**
- White's king is on e1, uncastled but not in immediate danger.
- Black's king is on e8, uncastled, and the g8 rook is oddly placed (from h8g8). Black's queenside rook and bishop are undeveloped.

**Piece Activity:**
- White's queen is on g2, knight on e5 (very active), bishop on f1, rooks on a1 and h1, pawns on e4, g3, h3, etc.
- Black's only active piece is the rook on g8. The rest are undeveloped.

**Threats:**
- White's knight on e5 is eyeing f7 (potential fork).
- White's queen is very active on g2.
- Black's king is vulnerable.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **e5f7**: Nf7+ is a check, forking king and rook on g8. If Kxf7, then Bc4+ picks up the king in the center. If K moves, White wins the exchange.
2. **e5g4**: Retreat, but not aggressive.
3. **g2f3**: Retreat queen, but not necessary.
4. **f1c4**: Develops bishop, but Nf7+ is more forcing.
5. **Other pawn moves**: Not urgent.

**Calculate Nf7+:**
- 1. Nf7+ Kxf7 (forced, otherwise White wins the rook)
- 2. Bc4+ d5 (only block)
- 3. Bxd5+ Be6 (only block)
- 4. Bxe6+ Kxe6
- White is up the exchange and has a strong attack.

Alternatively, after 1. Nf7+:
- 1... Ke7 (to avoid losing the rook)
- 2. Nxe5 (retreat), White is up a pawn and Black's king is exposed.

**Is there a better move?**
- No, Nf7+ is the most forcing and wins material.

**Final move:**
```
e5f7

2025-06-11 21:04:32,466 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.01s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 9...Kf7:**
- Black's king is on f7, exposed and unable to castle.
- Black's queenside pieces are undeveloped.
- White has a significant lead in development and initiative.
- White's queen is on g2, eyeing the kingside and center.
- White's dark-squared bishop is ready to develop.
- White's rook can come to f1 quickly.
- Black's king is vulnerable on the open f-file.

**Immediate tactical ideas:**
- Moves like Bc4+ or Bf1-c4+ look tempting, checking the king and developing.
- Rf1 is a strong idea, bringing the rook to the open file.
- e4-e5 is also a candidate, opening lines and attacking the pinned knight on f6 (but the knight is not there anymore).
- Developing the knight (Nc3) is also possible, but less forcing.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Bc4+ — develops with tempo, checks the king, forces Black to respond.
2. Rf1+ — brings the rook to the open file, but Black can block with the bishop (Bf6).
3. Nc3 — develops, but not as forcing.
4. Qf3+ — queen check, but Black can block with the knight or bishop.
5. e4-e5 — gains space, but not as forcing as a check.

**Let's analyze Bc4+:**
- 10. Bc4+ d5 (only reasonable block, otherwise Kf6 or Ke8, both bad)
  - 11. Bxd5+ Be6 (forced)
    - 12. Bxe6+ Qxe6
      - White has traded off some pieces, but Black's king is still exposed and White is ahead in development.

Alternatively, after 10. Bc4+ Ke8, White can continue with Rf1, increasing pressure.

**Let's analyze Rf1+:**
- 10. Rf1+ Ke8 (forced, as Kg6 is not possible)
- Now Bc4, pinning the king to the rook, or Qf3, increasing pressure.

**Which is better: Bc4+ or Rf1+?**
- Bc4+ is more direct and forces Black to make a decision immediately.
- Rf1+ is also strong, but after Ke8, White can play Bc4, and the king is stuck in the center.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- After Bc4+, if Black plays d5, White can take en passant (exd5), opening the e-file.
- If Black plays Ke8, White can play Qf3, threatening mate on f7.

**Let's check Bc4+ d5 exd5:**
- 10. Bc4+ d5
- 11. exd5 Qd6 (trying to block)
- 12. O-O+ (castling, bringing rook to f1)
- Black is in deep trouble.

**Conclusion:**
Bc4+ is the most forcing and strongest move, developing with tempo and keeping Black's king in the center.

**Final move:**

2025-06-11 21:05:04,944 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.27s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material Count:**
- White: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 7 pawns
- Black: 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 7 pawns

**Key features:**
- Black's king is on e8, unable to castle, and is exposed.
- White's queen is on g2, bishop on c4, and White has a strong initiative.
- Black's rook is on g8, but Black's other rook and bishop are undeveloped.
- White can deliver checks and threaten mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop c4-g8+**: This forces Black's rook to capture (Rook is forced to take, as king can't move to f8 or d8 due to bishop and queen). After Rxg8, White can play Qxg8+ and after Bf8, Qxg8, White wins a rook and keeps the attack.
2. **Bishop c4-f7+**: This check forces Ke7, but then White doesn't have a follow-up check, and Black's king can try to escape.
3. **Queen g2-f3**: Threatens mate on f7, but Black can defend with Qf6 or Nf6 (but Black has no queen or knight!).
4. **Other bishop moves**: Don't seem to pose an immediate threat.

**Calculation of Bg8+:**
- 1. Bc4-g8+ Rxg8 (forced)
- 2. Qg2xg8+ Bf8 (forced)
- 3. Qg8xg8

After this sequence, White wins a rook and maintains a strong attack. Black's king is still exposed, and White is up material.

**Is there a mate?**
- After Bg8+ Rxg8 Qxg8+ Bf8 Qxg8, Black's king is stuck in the center, and White is up a rook. No immediate mate, but White's advantage is decisive.

**Alternative:**
- Bc4-f7+ Ke7, White doesn't have a follow-up, so not as strong.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
c4g8
```

2025-06-11 21:05:39,401 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.37s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 7 Pawns
- Black: 2 Rooks, Bishop, 7 Pawns

White is up a queen for a bishop. Black's king is on e8, unable to castle, and White's bishop is on g8, pinning the c5 bishop to the king. Black's rook is on g8, but White's queen is very active on g2.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The bishop on g8 is attacking c5, but it's defended by the queen on g2.
- The queen on g2 is eyeing b7 and g8.
- The Black king is stuck in the center and vulnerable.
- White has a massive material advantage and should avoid any counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop takes h7 (g8h7):** This grabs a pawn and threatens to invade via h7, but doesn't immediately threaten mate.
2. **Queen takes b7 (g2b7):** Attacks the rook on a8 and threatens discovered checks with the bishop, but Black can play Nc6 to defend.
3. **Queen to f3 (g2f3):** Centralizes the queen, but not as forcing.
4. **Queen to h2 (g2h2):** Not very useful.
5. **Queen to f2 (g2f2):** Not very useful.
6. **Queen to e2 (g2e2):** Not very useful.
7. **Queen to g1 (g2g1):** Not useful.
8. **Queen to f1 (g2f1):** Not useful.
9. **h1g1:** Rook to open the g-file, but not urgent.
10. **e4e5:** Opens the center, but Black's king is already exposed.
11. **b1c3:** Develops a piece, but not urgent.

**Critical lines:**

- **g8h7:** If Bxh7, Black can't recapture, and White threatens Qxg8+ and Qf7+ ideas.
- **g2b7:** If Qxb7, Black can play Nc6, defending the rook, but White can play Qxa8, winning more material.
- **g8e6:** Bxe6 dxe6, Qxg8+ Ke7, Qxg7+ Kd6, Qf8+ Kc6, Qe8+ Kb6, Qxe5, White is up a queen and a pawn.

But the most forcing is **Qxb7**:

- **g2b7:** Qxb7 attacks the rook on a8 and threatens Qxa8, and Black can't defend both the rook and the bishop on c5. If Nc6, Qxa8 wins a rook.

Alternatively, **g8h7** (Bxh7) threatens to invade on h7, but doesn't win more material immediately.

**Let's check for any tactics for Black after Qxb7:**
- After Qxb7, Nc6, Qxa8, Black has no compensation.

**Conclusion:**
- **Qxb7** is the most forcing, wins more material, and keeps the initiative.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g2b7
```

2025-06-11 21:05:45,977 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.58s):
Thank you for pointing out the error. Let's carefully reconsider the position and only use the legal moves provided:

Legal moves:
g8h7, g8f7, g8e6, g8d5, g8c4, g8b3, g2f3, g2h2, g2f2, g2e2, g2g1, g2f1, h1h2, h1g1, h1f1, e1e2, e1f1, e1d1, b1c3, b1a3, e4e5, h3h4, g3g4, d2d3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, d2d4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4

**Position recap:**
- White's bishop is on g8, pinning the bishop on c5.
- Black's king is on e8, unable to castle.
- White's queen is on g2, very active.
- White is up a queen for a bishop.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8h7** (Bxh7): Bishop takes pawn, threatens Bxg8 and Qxg8+ ideas.
2. **g8f7** (Bxf7+): Bishop check, forces Kxf7, then Qf3+ picks up the bishop on c5 with check.
3. **g8e6** (Bxe6): Bishop takes pawn, threatens discovered checks.
4. **g2f3** (Qf3): Attacks b7 and c5, but not as forcing.
5. **e4e5**: Opens the center, but not urgent.

**Let's analyze Bxf7+:**
- 1. Bxf7+ Kxf7 (forced)
- 2. Qf3+ Ke8 (only move)
- 3. Qxh5+ (picks up a pawn, attacks h7, but Black can play g6)
- 4. Qxh7 (if g6 is not played), but Black can defend.

Alternatively, after 1. Bxf7+ Kxf7, 2. Qf3+ Ke8, 3. Qxh5+ g6, 4. Qxe5+ Be7, White is up a queen and a pawn, and Black's king is still exposed.

**Let's check Bxh7:**
- 1. Bxh7, no immediate threat, but threatens Qxg8+ and Qf7+.

**Let's check Bxe6:**
- 1. Bxe6 dxe6, 2. Qxg8+ Bf8, 3. Qxe6+ Be7, White is up a queen for a bishop, but Black's king is still exposed.

**Best move:**
- Bxf7+ is the most forcing, wins a pawn, exposes the king, and allows White to continue the attack.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g8f7
```

2025-06-11 21:06:32,770 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.16s):
Let's analyze the position carefully.

**Position after 12... Kf8:**

- White: King on e1, Queen on g2, Bishop on f7, Rooks on a1 and h1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h2, Knight on b1.
- Black: King on f8, Queen off the board, Bishop on c5, Rooks on a8 and g8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g7, h7.

**Material:**
- White is up a queen for a bishop and a pawn (massive advantage).
- White's bishop on f7 is very strong, pinning the king and threatening tactics.
- Black's king is exposed and cannot castle.
- White's queen is active on g2.
- White's knight is undeveloped, but that's not urgent.

**Immediate threats and tactics:**
- White can consider Qf3, threatening mate on f7 (but f7 is occupied by the bishop).
- Qf1 threatens mate on f7, but again, the bishop is there.
- Qf3 also threatens Qxg8+.
- The bishop on f7 is very strong, but not currently threatening mate.
- Black's only defender is the bishop on c5.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop retreat (Bishop on f7):** Bxg8, but that just trades a strong bishop for a rook, which is not necessary right now.
2. **Queen moves:** Qf3, Qf1, Qe2, Qh2, Qe2.
   - Qf3 attacks the rook on a8 and keeps pressure on f7.
   - Qf1 threatens mate on f7, but the bishop is there.
   - Qf3 also threatens Qxg8+.
3. **Developing moves:** Nc3, b3, d3, but these are slow.
4. **Pawn moves:** e4-e5, opening the center, but the king is already exposed.
5. **Rook moves:** h1f1, bringing another piece into the attack.

**Tactical calculation:**
- If Qf3, Black cannot defend g8 except by moving the bishop, but then Bxg8+ wins the rook.
- If Qf3, Black could try ...Nc6, but that's not possible (no knight).
- If Qf3, Black could try ...d6, but then Bxg8+.
- If Qf3, Black could try ...Rh8, but that's not possible (rook is on g8).
- If Qf3, Black could try ...Bd6, but then Bxg8.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Qf3 threatens both Qxg8+ and Qxa8.
- If Black plays ...Rh8 (illegal), or ...Bd6, then Bxg8+ wins.
- If Black plays ...Ke7, then Bxg8+.

**Is there a better move?**
- Qf3 is very strong, threatening to win material and keep the attack.
- Bxg8+ is tempting, but after Kxg8, White loses the bishop and the attack slows.
- Qf3 keeps all threats alive.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is **Qf3**, keeping the attack, threatening Qxg8+, and attacking the rook on a8.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 21:06:56,019 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.91s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- White: Queen (f3), Rooks (a1, h1), Bishop (f7), pawns
- Black: Rook (g8), Bishop (e3), pawns

**King safety:**
- White's king (e1) is safe, can castle.
- Black's king is on f8, exposed, and cannot castle.

**Threats:**
- White's bishop on f7 is very strong, cutting off the Black king's escape.
- White's queen is centralized and ready to attack.
- Black's bishop on e3 is active, but not threatening immediate mate.
- Black's rook on g8 is not attacking.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop takes g8 (f7xg8):** Captures the rook, but bishop is then on the edge and can be attacked.
2. **Queen takes e3 (f3xe3):** Captures the bishop, wins material, threatens further attack.
3. **Queen to f5+ (f3f5+):** Immediate check, but Black can block with Qf6 or move the king.
4. **Queen to h5 (f3h5):** Threatens mate on f7, but Black can defend.
5. **Queen to f6 (f3f6):** Threatens mate on d8, but Black can defend with Qe7.

**Calculation:**
- If 1. Bxg8 Rxg8, White's bishop is now on g8, but Black's rook is gone. White is up material, but loses the powerful bishop on f7.
- If 2. Qxe3, White wins a piece, threatens to invade on the dark squares, and keeps the bishop on f7, which is a huge asset.

**Best move:**
- Qxe3 wins a piece, keeps the attack, and maintains the strong bishop on f7. Black has no immediate threats, and White can continue to press for mate or further material gain.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f3e3
```

2. **Bishop moves**: Bxg8 is not possible, but the bishop is already well placed.
3. **Castling**: e1-g1 is possible, but not urgent.
4. **Other queen moves**: Qc5+ is possible, but Qxe5+ is stronger.

**Let's calculate Qxe5+:**
- 15. Qxe5+ Kxf7 (forced)
- 16. Rf1+ Kg6 (only move)
- 17. Qf5+ Kh6 (only move)
- 18. d3# (mate)

Alternatively, after 15. Qxe5+ Kd8, White can play Qg5+ and keep attacking.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- 15. Qg5+ also looks strong, but Black can play Kxf7.
- 15. Qc5+ d6 16. Qxc7+ Kf6 17. Rf1+ Kg6 18. Qf7+ Kh6 19. d3# (similar pattern).

**Conclusion:**
The move 15. Qxe5+ is the most forcing and leads to a quick mate or decisive material gain.

**Final move:**
```
e3e5
```

Thank you for the correction and for providing the legal moves.

Let's carefully analyze the position and the legal moves:

**White to move. Legal moves:**
- f7g8, f7e8, f7g6, f7e6, f7h5, f7d5, f7c4, f7b3
- e3a7, e3h6, e3b6, e3g5, e3c5, e3f4, e3d4, e3f3, e3d3, e3c3, e3b3, e3a3, e3f2, e3e2, e3g1
- h1h2, h1g1, h1f1
- e1f2, e1e2, e1f1, e1d1, b1c3, b1a3, e1g1
- e4e5, h3h4, g3g4, d2d3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, d2d4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4

**Key features:**
- Black's king is on e7, unable to castle, and exposed.
- White's queen is on e3, eyeing the kingside.
- White's bishop is on f7, controlling key squares.
- White's rooks are on a1 and h1, ready to join the attack.
- White is up a queen for a bishop and pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e3g5** (Q-g5+): Immediate check, forcing ...Kxf7 (only move), then White can continue the attack.
2. **e3c5+** (Q-c5+): Immediate check, but Black can block with d6.
3. **e3h6** (Q-h6): Threatens mate on g7, but Black can defend with Kxf7.
4. **h1f1** (Rf1): Threatens Rf7# if the king moves, but not immediate.
5. **e4e5**: Opens lines, but not forcing.
6. **e1g1** (O-O): Brings rook to f-file, but not urgent.

**Let's calculate Qg5+:**
- 1. Qg5+ Kxf7 (forced)
- 2. Rf1+ Ke8 (only move)
- 3. Qxe5+ Qe7 (forced)
- 4. Qxe7# (mate)

**Is there a faster mate?**
- Qg5+ is the most forcing and leads to mate in a few moves.

**Final move:**
```
e3g5
```

2025-06-11 21:07:34,482 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.86s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (f7), Rook (a1, h1), Bishop (f7), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3)
- Black: Rook (a8, g8), Bishop (c8), King (f8), pawns (a7, b7, c7, d7, d5, g7, h7)

**White to move.**

**King safety:**  
- Black's king is on f8, with no pawn cover and exposed to checks.
- White's queen is on f7, dominating the 7th rank.
- White's bishop is on f7, controlling key diagonals.
- Black's pieces are undeveloped and the king is very vulnerable.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can check on g8 or e7 with the queen.
- White can also consider moves like Qxg8+ (but that's not legal, as the rook is protected by the king).
- Qe7+ is possible, but the king can move to g8.
- Qg6 is a check, but the king can move to e7 or f8.
- Qf6+ is not possible.
- Qh5 is possible, but doesn't seem to lead to anything immediate.
- Qg7 is possible, but not a check.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qe7+ (forces Kg8, then Qe8# is mate)
2. Qg8+ (not legal, as the rook is protected by the king)
3. Qg6 (check, but king can escape)
4. Qg5 (no immediate threat)
5. Qg7 (no immediate threat)
6. Qd8 (no immediate threat)

Let's check Qe7+:

- 16. Qe7+ Kg8 (forced)
- 17. Qe8# (checkmate)

**Conclusion:**  
Qe7+ is a forced mate in two.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 21:08:04,129 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.39s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 17...Ke7:**

- White: King on e1, Rook on h1, Bishop on f7, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4
- Black: King on e7, Rook on a8, Bishop on c8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, g7, h7

White is up a full rook and has a dominating position. Black's king is exposed, and White's bishop on f7 is very strong, controlling key squares and threatening to invade.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop retreat:** Bf7-b3 or Bf7-g8 (but both are passive and unnecessary).
2. **Central break:** e4-e5, opening lines against the Black king.
3. **Develop knight:** Nb1-c3, bringing more pieces into play.
4. **Castling:** e1-g1 (kingside castling), bringing the rook into play and connecting rooks.
5. **Pawn moves:** h3-h4, g3-g4, but these are slow.
6. **Rook lift:** h1-f1, h1-g1, h1-h2, but the rook is not immediately threatening.

**Critical analysis:**
- The Black king is stuck in the center and cannot castle.
- White is up material and has a safe king.
- Castling kingside (e1-g1) is legal and brings the rook to the open f-file, threatening Rf1 and pressure on f7/f8.
- e4-e5 is tempting, but after d7-d6, the center is closed and Black can try to defend.
- Developing the knight with Nc3 is good, but castling is more urgent to bring the rook into play.

**Best move:**
Castling kingside is the most logical and powerful move. It brings the rook to the open file, connects the rooks, and keeps the king safe. After castling, White can double rooks on the f-file or play d2-d4 to open the center.

**Final move:**

2025-06-11 21:08:50,262 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.24s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (f7), two rooks (a1, f1), minor pieces (b1, c1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4)
- Black: Rook (a8), bishop (c8), pawns (a7, b7, c7, d7, e5, g7, h7), king (d6)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on d6, with no pawn cover.
- White's queen is on f7, ready to swing to dangerous squares.
- White's rooks are ready to join the attack.
- Black's pieces are undeveloped and passive.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **f7g8**: Queen to g8, but no immediate threat.
2. **f1f6+**: Rook to f6 with check. Black must respond.
3. **e4e5+**: Pawn to e5 with check. Black can move the king, but this opens lines.
4. **b1c3**: Develops a piece, but not urgent.
5. **h3h4**: Not urgent.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- The move **Rf6+** is very forcing. If Black plays ...Kc5, then d4# is mate. If ...Kc6, then Qc4# is mate. If ...Ke7, then Qf8# is mate.
- **e4e5+** is also strong, but less forcing than Rf6+.

Let's check **Rf6+** in detail:
- 1. Rf6+ Kc5 2. d4# (mate)
- 1. Rf6+ Kc6 2. Qc4# (mate)
- 1. Rf6+ Ke7 2. Qf8# (mate)
- 1. Rf6+ Kc7 2. Nb5+ (followed by Qd6# or Qc4#)

**Conclusion:**  
**Rf6+** is a forced win, leading to mate in all lines.

My move:
```
f1f6

2025-06-11 21:09:29,686 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.68s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- White: Queenless, but up a rook and a pawn for a bishop (White has 2 rooks, Black has 1 bishop, both have pawns)
- Black: King on c5, bishop on b8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g7, h7

**White's pieces:**
- Rooks: f6, a1
- King: g1
- Bishop: f7
- Pawns: a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4

**Black's king is exposed on c5. White's rook on f6 and bishop on f7 are very active.**

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rf5+**: This checks the king and forces it to move. Let's see where the king can go:
   - c6: Only move (since d4, d5, d6 are covered by the bishop and rook)
2. **Rf3**: Preparing to swing the rook to c3 for a check.
3. **d4+**: Pawn check, but Black can play Kxd4, so not effective.
4. **d3**: Prepares d4, but not urgent.
5. **Rf2**: Not threatening.
6. **Rf4**: Not threatening.

**Let's analyze Rf5+:**
- 19. Rf5+ Kc6 (forced)
- Now, Rf6-f6 is not a check, but we can try d4, but Kd6 escapes.
- Alternatively, Rf6-d6+ is not possible.
- What about Rf6-f3, preparing Rc3+? But that's slow.

**What about d4+ immediately?**
- 19. d4+ Kxd4 (forced)
- 20. c3+ Kxe4 (Black king is running away, not good)

**What about Rf5+ Kc6, then Bd5+?**
- 19. Rf5+ Kc6
- 20. Bd5+ Kb6 (only move)
- 21. Rf8 (threatening Rxb8)
- But then Black can play c6, but White is winning the bishop.

**But after 19. Rf5+ Kc6 20. Bd5+ Kb6 21. Rf8, Black can play c6, but then Rxb8 wins the bishop.**

**Is there a mate?**
- 19. Rf5+ Kc6
- 20. Bd5+ Kb6
- 21. Rf8 (threatening Rxb8)
- If Black plays c6, 22. Rxb8+ Kc7 23. Rb7+ Kd6 24. Rxa7, White is up a rook.

**Alternatively, after 19. Rf5+ Kc6 20. Bd5+ Kb6 21. Rf8, if Black plays c5, then 22. Rxb8+ Kc7 23. Rb7+ Kd6 24. Rxa7, again White is up a rook.**

**Conclusion:** The move 19. Rf5+ is the strongest, as it drives the king further into the open and wins material.

**Final move:**

2025-06-11 21:10:12,615 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.22s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queenless, but up a full rook and two pawns for the queen. White's rook is active on f5, bishop on f7, king on g1, pawns are healthy.
- Black: King on b4, rook on a8, bishop on b8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, g7, h7.

**Positional Factors:**
- Black's king is exposed on b4.
- White's rook and bishop are aggressively placed.
- Black's rook and bishop are undeveloped and stuck on the queenside.
- White can try to checkmate or win more material with precise play.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Bishop checks:** f7 to b3+ or f7 to c4+.
   - f7-b3+ forces the king to a5 or c5.
   - f7-c4+ forces the king to c5 or a5.
2. **Rook checks:** f5-f4+ or f5-f3+.
   - f5-f4+ forces the king to c5 or a4.
   - f5-f3+ forces the king to c5 or a4.
3. **Rook moves:** f5-f6, f5-h5, etc.
4. **King moves:** Not urgent.
5. **Pawn moves:** Not urgent.

**Calculation:**
- Let's try **f7-b3+**:
  - 1. Bf7-b3+ Ka5 (if Kc5, then d4+ wins the queen)
  - 2. Rf5xe5+ (if Ka6, then Bc4# is mate)
  - If 1... Kc5, then d4+ is devastating.

- Let's try **Rf5-f4+**:
  - 1. Rf4+ Kc5 (if Ka4, then b3# is mate)
  - 2. d4+ Kxd4 (if Kb4, then Bc4# is mate)
  - 2... Kb4 Bc4#

- Let's try **Rf5-f3+**:
  - 1. Rf3+ Kc5 (if Ka4, then b3# is mate)
  - 2. d4+ Kxd4 (if Kb4, then Bc4# is mate)
  - 2... Kb4 Bc4#

- Let's try **Rf5xe5**:
  - 1. Rxe5 Kc4 (if Kc5, then d4+)
  - Not as forcing.

- Let's try **Rf5-b5+**:
  - 1. Rb5+ Kxb5 (if Ka4, then b3# is mate)
  - 2. b3+ Ka5 (if Kc5, then d4# is mate)
  - 3. Bc4#

- Let's try **Rf5-a5+**:
  - 1. Ra5+ Kxa5 (if Kc4, then d3# is mate)
  - 2. b4#

- Let's try **Rf5-f6** (quiet move): Not urgent.

**Best Move:**
- **Rf5-a5+** is check, and if Kxa5, then b4# is mate.
- If Kc4, then d3# is mate.

So, **Rf5-a5+** is a forced mate in one or two.

**Final move:**
```
f5a5

2025-06-11 21:11:06,737 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 11.50s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb5/pppp1Bpp/8/k7/4P3/6PP/PPPP4/RNB3K1 w - - 0 21  
**White to move.**

**Material count:**
- White: Queen is gone, but has two rooks, two bishops, and pawns.
- Black: Queen is gone, has two rooks, two bishops, and pawns.

But looking at the board, Black's king is on a5, very exposed. White's bishop on f7 is cutting off escape squares. White's rook is on a1, ready to swing into action. Black's pieces are undeveloped and stuck on the back rank.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The Black king is on a5, with no pawn cover.
- The bishop on f7 covers b5 and d5.
- The rook on a1 can swing to a3 or a4 for a check.
- The move b4+ is possible, but the bishop on f7 covers b4, so that's not an option for Black.
- White can play b4+, which would be check, but the bishop on f7 covers b4, so that's not possible.
- White can play a4, threatening a5-a6+ or a4-a5+.
- White can play rook a3, threatening Ra5# (mate).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ra3**: Threatens Ra5# (mate), but Black can play Kb4, escaping.
2. **a4**: Threatens a5-a6+ or a4-a5+, but not immediate mate.
3. **b4+**: Not possible, bishop covers b4.
4. **d4**: Opens up the center, but not relevant to the king hunt.
5. **Rook moves**: Ra2, Ra4, etc.

**Let's calculate Ra3:**
- 21. Ra3 Kb4 (only move)
- 22. c3+ Kc5 (only move)
- 23. d4+ Kxd4 (only move)
- 24. Be3+ Kxe4
- 25. Nd2+ Kd3
- 26. Bc4+ Kc2
- 27. Ra2+ Kd1
- 28. Nf3

But this is a long sequence, and Black's king is running, but White is attacking.

**What about a4?**
- 21. a4 Kb4 (only move)
- 22. c3+ Kc5 (only move)
- 23. d4+ Kxd4
- 24. Be3+ Kxe4
- 25. Nd2+ Kd3
- 26. Bc4+ Kc2
- 27. Ra2+ Kd1
- 28. Nf3

Same as above.

**What about c3?**
- 21. c3 Kb5 (only move)
- 22. Na3+ Ka4
- 23. b3+ Ka5
- 24. Nc4+ Ka6
- 25. Nxe5

But this is not as forcing.

**What about b4+?**
- Not possible.

**What about Rook a4?**
- 21. Ra4+ Kb5
- 22. Nc3+ Kc5
- 23. d4+ Kd6
- 24. dxe5+ Kxe5
- 25. Bf4+ Kf6
- 26. e5+ Kf5
- 27. g4#

But this is not possible because the rook is on a1, and the bishop is on f7.

**What about a3?**
- Not threatening anything.

**What about h4?**
- Not relevant.

**What about g4?**
- Not relevant.

**What about developing the knight?**
- Nc3: 21. Nc3 Kb4 (only move)
- 22. Ra4+ Kc5
- 23. b4+ Kd4
- 24. Nb5#

But the knight is on b1, so Nc3 is possible.

**Let's try 21. Nc3:**
- 21. Nc3 Kb4 (only move)
- 22. Ra4+ Kc5
- 23. b4+ Kd4
- 24. Nb5#

Wait, let's check if this is legal:
- 21. Nc3 Kb4
- 22. Ra4+ Kc5
- 23. b4+ Kd4
- 24. Nb5#

But after 21. Nc3, Black can play Kb4, then 22. Ra4+ Kc5, 23. b4+ Kd4, 24. Nb5#

This is a forced mate in 4.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
b1c3
```
This is the most forcing and leads to a forced mate.

2025-06-11 21:11:41,491 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 14.72s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

---

### **FEN:**
`rnb5/pppp1Bpp/8/k7/4P3/2N3PP/PPPP4/R1B3K1 b - - 1 21`

- Black to move.
- Material is roughly equal.
- King safety: Both kings are relatively safe, but Black has a centralized king on e8 that has already moved to k5 and back (possibly).
- White has a bishop on f7 (very active), rook on a1, and a knight on c3. White also has a central pawn majority.
- Black's pieces are somewhat passive. The king is in the center, and the knight on b8 hasn't moved yet.
- Black's queenside pawns are advanced, with a passed pawn on a5.

---

### **Legal Moves:**

We must evaluate each move for tactical and strategic merit:

#### Candidate Moves:
1. `a5b4` – Capturing on b4 could open up lines and activate the rook on a8.
2. `a5a6` – Pushing the passed pawn forward.
3. `b8c6` – Developing the knight.
4. `d7d6` – Supporting the king and preparing development.
5. `g7g6` – Possibly to dislodge the dangerous white bishop on f7.
6. `h7h6` – Preventing Bh5 ideas.

---

### **Evaluation of Key Move: `a5b4`**

This seems like the most dynamic and promising move.

- It captures on b4, removing a defender (pawn or knight) and opening the a-file.
- If White recaptures with `c3xb4`, then Black gains control over c4 and opens lines for the rook.
- This creates immediate tension and activates Black’s rook on a8.
- It also exploits the fact that White’s queenside is underdeveloped and weak.

Let’s look at some variations after `a5b4`:

#### Variation 1:
**1... a5b4 2. c3xb4 Rc8+ 3. Bc4 Rxc4**, and Black has good play with an open file and active rook.

#### Variation 2:
**1... a5b4 2. a3 bxa3 3. Rxa3 Kb6**, and Black pressures the queenside with king involvement.

Even if White avoids capture, Black gains space and initiative.

---

### **Why not other moves?**

- `b8c6` is developing, but too slow in this critical position.
- `a5a6` is passive compared to taking action on b4.
- `g7g6` would be useful if we were going to follow up with ...Bf5 or ...Bg4, but currently lacks support.
- `d7d6` is defensive; not what we want when we can take the initiative.

---

### ✅ Best Move:

```
a5b4

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (f7), Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (c3), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4), King (g1)
- Black: Rook (g8), Bishop (b8), Knight (b8), pawns (a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g7, h7), King (b4)

**White's advantages:**
- White is up a queen for a rook and minor piece.
- Black's king is exposed on b4.
- White's queen is very active on f7.
- Black's pieces are undeveloped and the king is vulnerable.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- White can deliver a check with Qb3+ or Qe7+.
- Qb3+ looks very strong, as it forces the king to a3 or a5, both of which are dangerous.
- Qb3+ Ka5 (forced), then Qb5# is checkmate.

**Calculation:**
1. Qb3+ Ka5 (only move)
2. Qb5# (checkmate)

**Conclusion:**
White has a forced mate in 2 with Qb3+.

**Final move:**
```
f7b3

2025-06-11 21:12:29,954 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c3), Bishop (c3), King (g1), pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4, b3
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (b8), King (a5), pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g7, h7

**King safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on a5.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Piece activity:**
- White's pieces are very active, especially the bishop on c3 and the rook on a1.
- Black's pieces are undeveloped and passive.

**Threats:**
- White can attack the exposed black king.
- The move b3 threatens to trap the black king with a4 and possibly Ba5.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b3a4**: Check, but Black can block with ...Ka4.
2. **c3d5**: Centralizing the bishop, but not immediately threatening.
3. **b3c4**: Check, but Black can play Ka4.
4. **b3g8, b3f7, b3e6, b3d5, b3c4, b3a4**: All rook moves, but b3a4 is check.
5. **e4e5**: Not urgent.
6. **h3h4, g3g4**: Not urgent.
7. **d2d3, d2d4**: Not urgent.

**Critical calculation:**
- **b3a4+**: Black must play Ka4 (only move).
- Then, **Bc3xe5** threatens mate with Bb2#.
- But after Ba5, Black can play ...b5 and escape.

Alternatively, what about **a2a3**? Threatens b4# mate, but Black can play ...b5.

What about **d2d4**? Threatens d4-d5, but not immediate.

What about **b3c4+**? After Ka4, White can play Bb2, threatening mate.

But let's check **b3a4+**:
1. b3a4+ Ka4 (forced)
2. Bb3xe5 (threatening Bb2#)
   - If ...b5, then Bxb5# (mate)
   - If ...Ka3, then Bb2#

So let's check:
1. b3a4+ Ka4
2. Bxe5 b5 (only move)
3. Bxb5#

**This is checkmate in 3!**

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b3a4
```

Let's analyze the current position thoroughly.

---

### **FEN Position:**
```
rnb5/pppp2pp/8/k7/B3P3/2N3PP/PPPP4/R1B3K1 b - - 5 23
```

### **Material Status:**
- White has a bishop and knight for Black’s rook and pawn.
- Material is roughly equal (Rook + pawn ≈ Bishop + Knight).
- Both sides have weakened king positions, but Black's king is more centralized.

### **Positional Observations:**
- Black's king is on a5 — very exposed, but also active.
- White's king is on g1 — somewhat safer due to castling.
- Black has a passed a-pawn that could potentially promote if supported.
- The queens are off the board; this is an endgame or late middlegame.
- Black has several pawns on the queenside and center. White has a majority on the kingside.

### **Black's Legal Moves:**

```
b8c6, b8a6, a5b6, a5a6, a5b4, h7h6, g7g6, d7d6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, d7d5, c7c5, b7b5
```

We'll evaluate the most promising ones:

---

## Candidate Moves:

### 1. **...a5-a6**
- Pushes the passed pawn forward.
- Threatens to queen if not stopped.
- Very aggressive and forces White to respond immediately.
- After **a5-a6**, White may play **Ba4-b3** to try to stop it.
- This move activates the black king and centralizes it toward the queenside.

### 2. **...b7-b5+**
- Gains space on the queenside.
- Could open lines for rooks.
- Might be met with **c3xb5**, after which **a5xb5** gives Black a strong passed pawn.
- Also creates tactical threats.

### 3. **...c7-c5**
- Central break.
- Could help activate Black’s pieces in the center.
- But seems less urgent than pushing the queenside pawns.

### 4. **...a5-b4**
- King moves toward the center.
- Could support a queenside breakthrough.
- But might give White time to regroup.

---

## Evaluation:

The key idea here is **queening the a-pawn**. It's already advanced and supported by the king. White must deal with it immediately or risk losing.

Pushing **...a5-a6** is the most forcing and dangerous move. It threatens to march down the board and promotes if not stopped. It also forces White to use tempo defending instead of counterattacking.

Let’s look at the line:
- **23...a6**
- **24. Ba4 b5?** fails to **25. Bxb5 axb5 26. Rxa8**, so better is:
- **24. Ba4 Rc8!** (preparing ...c5), or even **...b6** to fix the bishop.

But regardless, **...a6** puts immediate pressure on White and starts a race.

---

## Final Decision:

The best move is to push the pawn and start the promotion race:

```
a5a6
```

- White: King on g1, rook on a4, bishop on a4, knight on c3, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4
- Black: King on a6, rook on g8, bishop on b8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f7, g7, h7

**Material:**
- White: Rook, bishop, knight, 8 pawns
- Black: Rook, bishop, 7 pawns

**Key features:**
- White is up a pawn.
- Black's king is exposed on a6.
- White's rook and bishop are active on the queenside.
- Black's rook is on g8, not active.
- White's knight on c3 can jump to d5 or b5 with tempo.
- Black's bishop on b8 is undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a4d7 (Ra4-d7): Invades the 7th rank, attacks b7, threatens Rxd7, and possibly Ba3.
2. a4c6 (Ra4-c6): Attacks the a6 king, but bxc6 is possible.
3. a4b5 (Ra4-b5): Pins the b7 pawn, threatens Ra5+.
4. a4b3 (Ra4-b3): Defends b2, but not aggressive.
5. c3d5 (Nc3-d5): Centralizes the knight, attacks c7 and b6.
6. c3b5 (Nc3-b5): Attacks a7 and c7, threatens Nc7+.
7. e4e5: Opens the center, but not urgent.
8. h3h4: Not urgent.
9. g3g4: Not urgent.

**Analysis of top candidates:**

**1. Ra4-d7**
- Threatens Rxd7, attacks b7, and controls the 7th rank.
- If Black plays ...c6, then Rxf7 wins a pawn.
- If Black plays ...b6, then Rxf7 is still strong.
- If Black plays ...Ka5, then Rd5+ is crushing.

**2. Nc3-b5**
- Threatens Nc7+ fork, but after Kb6, Nc7 is not check.
- After ...Kb6, Nc7+ Ka5, Nxa8, Rxa8, White wins the bishop for the knight, but Black's king is still exposed.

**3. Ra4-b5**
- Threatens Ra5+ and pins b7, but Black can play ...b6.

**4. Nc3-d5**
- Centralizes the knight, attacks c7, but not as forcing as Ra4-d7.

**Conclusion:**
- Ra4-d7 is the most aggressive and keeps the initiative. It threatens to invade on the 7th rank, possibly win more material, and Black's king is very exposed.

**Final move:**
```
a4d7

2025-06-11 21:13:55,482 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (d7), Knight (c3), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3), King (g1)
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (b8), pawns (a5, b7, c7, d7, e5, g7, h7), King (a5)

**Position:**
- White is up a full piece (Bishop for a pawn) and has a dominating position.
- Black's king is exposed on a5, and White's bishop on d7 is very strong.
- White's knight on c3 can jump to d5, b5, or a4, all with tempo.
- White's rook on a1 is ready to enter the game.
- Black's pieces are undeveloped and the king is very unsafe.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d7e8**: Bishop takes rook, winning the exchange. After ...Bxe8, White is up a full rook.
2. **c3d5**: Knight jumps to d5, attacking c7 and b6, but doesn't threaten immediate tactics.
3. **c3b5**: Knight to b5, attacking a7 and c7, but a7 is defended.
4. **c3a4+**: Knight check, but Black can play ...Ka6 and the knight is not ideally placed.
5. **d7c8**: Bishop takes bishop, but e8 is a bigger prize.
6. **a1b1**: Rook to b1, threatening b7, but not as forcing as taking the rook.
7. **e4e5**: Advance pawn, but not urgent.

**Tactical check:**
- **d7e8**: Bishop takes rook. If ...Bxe8, White can play a3, trapping the king. If ...Ka6, White can play Bc8+ and then a3, trapping the king.
- After **d7e8**, Black is forced to recapture with the bishop, and White can continue with a3, trapping the king on a5.

**Calculation:**
1. d7e8 Bxe8 (forced)
2. a3 (threatening b4#)
   - If ...b6, then b4+ Ka6 b5# is mate.
   - If ...Ka6, then Bc8+ Ka7 a3, and the king is trapped.

**Conclusion:**
- **d7e8** is the best move, winning material and keeping Black's king in a mating net.

My move is:
```
d7e8
```

2025-06-11 21:14:40,383 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.60s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn2B3/ppp3pp/4b3/k7/4P3/2N3PP/PPPP4/R1B3K1 w - - 3 26

**White to move.**

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (e8), Knight (c3), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3), King (g1)
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (e6), pawns (a5, b7, c7, d7, g7, h7), King (a5)

**Key features:**
- White has a bishop on e8, deep in enemy territory.
- Black's king is exposed on a5.
- White's knight on c3 can jump to b5 or d5, both attacking squares.
- Black's bishop on e6 is defending the a2-g8 diagonal and can cover some squares around the king.
- Black's rook is on a8, but not active.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c3b5+** (Nc3-b5+): Knight check, forcing the king to a4 (since b6 is covered by the bishop).
2. **e8a4** (Be8-a4): Bishop check, but Black can block with the bishop (Bb3).
3. **e8b5** (Be8-b5): Bishop check, but Black can block with the bishop (Bb3).
4. **e8g6** (Be8-g6): Bishop attacks the rook, but not forcing.
5. **e8d7** (Be8-d7): Bishop attacks the c7 pawn, but not forcing.
6. **e4e5**: Not forcing, not relevant.
7. **h3h4**: Not relevant.

**Let's analyze the most forcing move:**
### 1. Nc3-b5+ (c3b5+)
- Black's king must move. Only legal move is **Ka4** (since b6 is covered by the bishop).
- After **Ka4**, White can play **Be8-a4#** (checkmate!).
- The bishop on e8 covers b5 and c6, the knight on b5 covers c7 and a7, the bishop on a4 covers the a-file, and the king is trapped by its own pawns.

**Checkmate sequence:**
1. Nc3-b5+ Ka4
2. Be8-a4#

**Conclusion:** The move **c3b5+** leads to a forced mate in 2.

**Final move:**
```
c3b5
```

2025-06-11 21:15:24,982 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.83s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (e8), Knight (b5), King (g1), pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4
- Black: Bishop (e6), King (b4), pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, g7, h7

**Position:**
- Black's king is exposed on b4.
- White's bishop on e8 is very powerful, controlling the a4-e8 diagonal and pinning the c6 square.
- White's knight on b5 is close to the black king and can jump to several key squares.
- Black's bishop on e6 is defending, but Black's king is very exposed.
- White has a huge positional and material advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5xc7+**: Knight captures pawn with check. Black must respond with Kc5 or Ka5.
2. **b5a7**: Knight attacks bishop and threatens Nc6+.
3. **e8f7**: Bishop moves, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
4. **e4e5**: Pawn push, but not urgent.
5. **g3g4**: Pawn push, not urgent.
6. **a1b1**: Rook lift, but not urgent.

**Tactical check:**
- **b5xc7+**: If Kc5, then Nxe6+ wins the bishop. If Ka5, then Nxe6 also wins the bishop. In both cases, White wins more material and keeps up the attack.

**Check for mate threats:**
- After b5xc7+ Kc5 Nxe6+ Kd6, White can play d2d4, opening more lines.
- Black's king is running out of squares.

**Conclusion:**
- **b5xc7+** is a forcing move, wins material, and keeps the black king exposed. It is the most precise and aggressive continuation.

My move is:
```
b5c7
```

2025-06-11 21:16:08,621 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.26s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rn2B3/ppN3pp/4b3/8/2k1P3/6PP/PPPP4/R1B3K1 w - - 1 28

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (e8), Knight (c7), King (g1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4)
- Black: Bishop (e6), King (c4), pawns (a7, b7, g7, h7)

**Key points:**
- White is up a full rook and a knight for a bishop and two pawns.
- Black's king is exposed on c4.
- White's knight on c7 is very powerful, attacking a8 and e6.
- White's bishop on e8 is also strong, controlling the a4-e8 diagonal and pinning the bishop on e6 if the king moves.
- Black's bishop on e6 is currently defended only by the king.
- White has many ways to press for a win, but must avoid any stalemate tricks or perpetuals.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c7xe6** (Knight takes bishop): Wins a piece, but after ...b5, the knight is trapped. However, White can then play b3+ and win the pawn.
2. **e8a4** (Bishop check): Forces the king to move, but doesn't win material immediately.
3. **e4e5** (Pawn push): Not urgent, as White has more direct threats.
4. **g1h2** (King move): Not urgent.
5. **a1b1** (Rook move): Not urgent.
6. **c7a8** (Knight move): Not urgent.

**Deep calculation:**

- **c7xe6** (Knight takes bishop)
    - If ...b5, then b3+ (pawn check), Kc5, Nxc5, Kxc5, bxc4, and White is up a full rook and should win easily.
    - If ...Kxe4, White is up a piece and can consolidate.

- **e8a4+** (Bishop check)
    - K moves, but then what? No immediate follow-up.

- **c7e6** (Knight to e6, attacking bishop): Not as strong as capturing.

**Conclusion:**
- **c7xe6** is the most direct, winning a piece and simplifying the position. Black has no counterplay.

**Final move:**
```
c7e6

2025-06-11 21:16:37,169 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 14.21s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (e6), Bishop (e8), King (g1), 7 pawns
- Black: Rook (g8), Knight (d7), King (c4), 6 pawns

**Position:**
- White is up a full bishop and has a dominating position. Black's king is exposed on c4, and White's bishops are extremely powerful, controlling many squares.
- Black's rook is on g8, knight on d7, king on c4. Black's pawns are not advanced and not threatening.
- White's move.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Bishop moves:** Both bishops are active. e6 can move to c7, d8, g7, c5, f4, d4. e8 can move to f7, d7, g6, h5.
2. **Pawn moves:** e4-e5, h3-h4, g3-g4, d2-d3, c2-c3, b2-b3, a2-a3, d2-d4, b2-b4, a2-a4.
3. **King moves:** g1-h2, g1-g2, g1-f2, g1-h1, g1-f1.
4. **Rook move:** a1-b1.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- Is there a forced mate? The Black king is on c4 and has limited escape squares.
- e6 controls c4, c5, d4, f4, g5, g7, f8, d8.
- e8 controls f7, d7, g6, h5.

**Immediate threats:**
- e6-d8+ is check, but Black can block with the knight.
- e6-c7+ is check, but Black can block with the knight.
- e6-g5 threatens the rook, but not check.
- e6-f4 is check, but Black can play Kd4.
- e6-c5 is check, but Black can play Kd4.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Let's try e6-c7+:
    - c7+ Kd4 (only move)
    - e8-b5 (threatening mate), but Black can play Nc5.

**What about e4-e5?**
- e4-e5 threatens to open the e-file and possibly play d2-d3+ in the future, but it's slow.

**What about rook moves?**

2025-06-11 21:17:10,049 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.64s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (e8), Knight (c7), King (g1), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4)
- Black: King (c4), pawns (a7, b7, g7, h7), Knight (f6)

**Position:**
- Black's king is exposed on c4.
- White's bishop on e8 is very powerful, cutting off the king's escape via c6/d7/f7.
- White's knight on c7 is very active, attacking b5 and d5.
- Black's knight on f6 is far from the action.
- White is up a rook for a knight and has a dominant position.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bishop moves:** e8-f7, e8-d7, e8-g6, e8-c6, e8-h5, e8-b5, e8-a4
   - e8-b5+ is check, forcing the king to move. If Kxb4, then Rb1+ wins the king.
   - e8-c6+ is check, but the king can go to d4 or b4.
   - e8-a4+ is check, but king can go to d4 or b4.

2. **Knight moves:** c7-a8, c7-e6, c7-a6, c7-d5, c7-b5
   - c7-b5+ is check, but king can go to b5 or d4.

3. **Rook moves:** a1-b1, but not immediately threatening.

4. **Pawn moves:** Not immediately threatening.

**Tactical shot:**
- **e8-b5+** is a check. Let's see what happens:
    - If Kxb4, then Rb1+ is mate (the king is trapped by its own pawns and White's bishop).
    - If Kd4, then c3# is mate (the bishop on e8 covers d7 and c6, knight covers e6 and b5, rook covers d1, king can't escape).

Let's check e8-b5+:
- 1. Be8-b5+ Kxb4 (forced)
- 2. Rb1+ Kc5 (only move)
- 3. Ne6# is mate (the bishop covers d7 and c6, rook covers b4, knight covers d4 and f4, king can't escape).

Alternatively, after 1. Be8-b5+, if Kd4:
- 2. c3# is mate.

**Conclusion:**  
**Be8-b5+** is a forced mate in 2.

**Final move:**
```
e8b5

2025-06-11 21:17:43,110 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.74s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (b5), Knight (c7), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4), King (g1)
- Black: Rook (g8), Knight (f6), pawns (a7, b7, d7, g7, h7), King (b4)

**White to move.**

**King safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on b4.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Piece activity:**  
- White's knight on c7 is very strong, attacking a8 and e6, and can jump to d5.
- White's bishop on b5 is active, controlling the a4–e8 diagonal and the b5–f1 diagonal.
- Black's rook is on g8, but not active on the queenside.
- Black's knight on f6 is far from the action.

**Threats:**  
- White threatens to invade with the knight or bishop.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c7d5**: Centralizes the knight, attacks b4, and threatens to fork.
2. **c7e6**: Attacks the knight on f6 and covers c5, but Black can play dxe6.
3. **b5d7**: Attacks the rook on g8 and threatens to win material.
4. **b5e2**: Retreats, not active.
5. **a1b1**: Brings the rook into play, attacking the king on b4.
6. **e4e5**: Kicks the knight, but not urgent.

**Tactical considerations:**
- **a1b1** is very strong: threatens to trap the king, as the king has no escape squares after b4 is covered.
- After **a1b1**, Black's king is in a mating net. For example, if Black plays ...Ka5, then Bxd7 wins the rook.
- If Black plays ...Kc5, then d4# is mate (pawn to d4 checkmate).
- If Black plays ...Ka3, then Rb3# is mate.

**Calculation:**
- **a1b1** Kc5 d4# is checkmate.
- **a1b1** Ka5 Bxd7 wins the rook.
- **a1b1** Ka3 Rb3# is checkmate.

**Conclusion:**  
The move **a1b1** is crushing and leads to immediate mate or decisive material gain.

My move is:
```
a1b1
```

2025-06-11 21:18:23,581 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.37s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (b5), Knight (c7), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3), King (g1)
- Black: Rook (a8), Knight (f6), pawns (a6, b7, g7, h7), King (a5)

**White to move.**

**King safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on a5.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**
- White's knight on c7 is very strong, attacking a8 and e6.
- White's bishop on b5 is pinning the a6 pawn (since the king is on a5).
- Black's rook is on a8, but not active.
- Black's knight on f6 is far from the action.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c7xa8** (Knight takes rook): Wins the exchange, but does it allow counterplay?
2. **c7e6** (Knight attacks): Attacks g7 and covers d4, but not as forcing.
3. **b5e8** (Bishop attacks rook): But the rook is defended by the knight.
4. **b5d3** (Bishop centralizes): Not as forcing.
5. **e4e5** (Pawn push): Not urgent.
6. **b1b3** (Rook lift): Could threaten mate on a3, but Black can defend.

**Let's check c7xa8:**
- 1. Nc7xa8 Rxa8 (if Black recaptures)
- Now, White can play Bc6, threatening mate on b7 (Bc6-b7#).
- Black cannot stop this mate: the only defense is to give up material or delay with pawn moves.

**But after 1. Nc7xa8, Black may not recapture immediately, but White is up a full rook and still has a dominating position.**

**Is there a forced mate?**
- After 1. Nc7xa8, if Black plays ...axb5, White plays Bxb5, and the king is still exposed.
- If 1. Nc7xa8, Black has no checks or threats.

**Alternative: b5xa6**
- Not possible, as the bishop is on b5.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- If 1. Bxa6, bxa6, 2. Nc7xa8, but this is just winning material.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to take the rook with the knight, winning material and maintaining a crushing position.

**Final move:**
```
c7a8

2025-06-11 21:19:17,189 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 12.45s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (b5), Knight (a8), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4), King (g1)
- Black: King (a5), pawns (a7, b7, g7, h7), Knight (g8)

**Position:**
- Black's king is on a5, somewhat exposed.
- White's knight on a8 is not attacked and can move.
- White's bishop on b5 controls the a6 and c6 squares, and cuts off the king's escape.
- White's rook on b1 is well placed to support an attack along the b-file.
- Black's knight on g8 is far from the action and not participating in defense.
- Black's pawns are not advanced and not threatening.

**Immediate threats:**
- White can consider Nc7+ or Nb6+ to check the king.
- The bishop on b5 covers a6 and c6, so the king's escape is limited.
- The rook can swing to b4 or b3 to cut off the king further.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Na8-c7+**: Check. King can only go to b6 (since a4 and a6 are covered by the bishop).
2. **Na8-b6+**: Check. King can only go to b4.
3. **Rb1-b4**: Cuts off the king's escape to b4, but not a check.
4. **e4-e5**: Not urgent, doesn't threaten anything immediate.
5. **h3-h4**: Not urgent.

Let's analyze **Na8-c7+**:

- 33. Nc7+ Kb6 (forced, as a4 and a6 are covered)
- Then, Rb1-b3+ is possible, but the king can go to c5.
- Or, after Kb6, White can play Nd5+ (if the knight is on c7), but that's not possible immediately.

What about **Na8-b6+**:

- 33. Nb6+ Kb4 (forced)
- Then, Bc4 (not possible), but Rb1-b4+ is possible, but the king can go to a5.

What about **Rb1-b4**:

- Not a check, but threatens to cut off the king.

What about **Bishop moves**? Not much.

What about **Rook moves**? Rb1-b3+ after Nc7+.

Let's try to visualize the sequence:

**Line 1: 33. Nc7+ Kb6**
- 34. Rb1-b3+ Kc5 (only move)
- 35. Ne6+ (from c7) Kd6 (only move)
- 36. Nxg7 (captures knight, but not urgent)
- But after 35. Ne6+, if Kd6, then Bc4 is a threat.

Alternatively, after 33. Nc7+ Kb6, 34. Nd5+ Kc5, 35. Bf1 (not urgent).

**Line 2: 33. Nb6+ Kb4**
- 34. Rb1-b4+ Ka5 (only move)
- 35. Nc4+ Ka6
- 36. Ra4#

Wait, let's check this:

33. Nb6+ Kb4
34. Rb1-b4+ Ka5
35. Nc4+ Ka6
36. Ra4#

This is checkmate! The bishop on b5 covers a6, the knight on c4 covers b6 and a5, the rook on a4 delivers mate, and the king cannot escape.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
b6
```

2025-06-11 21:19:48,828 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 21:19:55,934 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.11s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (b5), Knight (b6), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4), King (g1)
- Black: Rook (none), Bishop (none), Knight (e7), pawns (a7, b7, g7, h7), King (a5)

**Positional factors:**
- White is up a full rook for a knight and has a dominating position.
- Black's king is exposed on a5.
- White's knight on b6 is very strong, attacking a8 and c4.
- White's rook on b1 is well placed, and the bishop on b5 controls key diagonals.
- Black's knight on e7 is passive and has no threats.
- White has a passed e-pawn and potential for a kingside pawn storm.

**Immediate tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate or a way to win more material?
- The Black king is on a5, and White has the move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nc4+**: Check, forces the king to move. After K moves, White can continue to press.
2. **Nc8**: Attacks the a7 pawn, but not forcing.
3. **Nd5**: Centralizes, but not forcing.
4. **a4**: Threatens to open the a-file, but not forcing.
5. **Bf1**: Not relevant.
6. **Rook moves**: Rb2, Rb3, etc., but not forcing.

**Let's analyze Nc4+:**
- 1. Nc4+ K moves (only legal squares are a4 and b4)
    - If 1...Ka4, then 2. b3# is checkmate.
    - If 1...Kb4, then 2. c3+ Kc5 (only move), 3. d4# is checkmate.

**Let's check the lines:**

1. **Nc4+ Ka4**
    - b3# (the bishop on b5 covers a5, the knight on c4 covers b6 and a5, rook on b1 covers b4, pawn on a2 covers a3, so b3 is mate)

2. **Nc4+ Kb4**
    - c3+ Kc5 (only move)
    - d4# (the bishop on b5 covers d7, knight on c4 covers b6 and d6, rook on b1 covers b4, pawn on c3 covers d4, so d4 is mate)

**Conclusion:**  
Nc4+ is a forced mate in two. This is the best move.

**Final move:**
```
b6c4+
```

2025-06-11 21:20:30,757 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.64s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Rook (b1), Bishop (b5), Bishop (c4), pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4), King (g1)  
Black: Knight (e7), pawns (a7, b7, g7, h7), King (b4)

**Position:**  
- White is up a full rook and a bishop for a knight and two pawns.  
- Black's king is exposed on b4, and White's pieces are very active.  
- Black's knight on e7 is not threatening anything immediate.
- White's bishop on b5 is pinning the knight to the king, and the bishop on c4 is eyeing the d5 and f7 squares.
- White's rook on b1 is on an open file, and the king is safe on g1.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **Bishop moves:**  
   - b5e8: Attacks the knight and threatens to win it (since it's pinned).
   - b5d7: Attacks the knight and threatens to win it.
   - b5c6: Attacks the a7 pawn and threatens to win it.
   - b5a6: Attacks the a7 pawn and threatens to win it.
   - b5a4: Retreat, not useful.

2. **Bishop c4 moves:**  
   - c4d6: Attacks the knight and threatens to win it.
   - c4b6: Attacks the a7 pawn and threatens to win it.
   - c4e5: Centralizes, but not as strong as the above.
   - c4a5: Retreat, not useful.
   - c4e3: Retreat, not useful.
   - c4a3: Retreat, not useful.

3. **King moves:** Not urgent.

4. **Rook moves:**  
   - b1a1: Not useful.

5. **Pawn moves:**  
   - e4e5: Opens up the center, but not urgent.
   - h3h4, g3g4: Not urgent.
   - d2d3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, d2d4, a2a4: Not urgent.

**Tactical ideas:**  
- The black knight on e7 is pinned to the king by the bishop on b5.
- If White plays b5e8, the knight is attacked twice (by bishop and rook), and Black cannot defend it.
- After b5e8, Black cannot move the king, and the knight is lost.

**Calculation:**  
- 1. Bb5-e8 Nc6 (only move to block the pin)  
  - Then, Bxc6 bxc6, Rxb4+ Kc5, c3, and White is completely winning.
- 1. Bb5-e8, if Black plays Kc5, then d4+ wins the knight.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play **Bb5-e8**, attacking the pinned knight and threatening to win it. This is a clean, forcing move that increases White's material advantage and keeps the initiative.

My move is:
```
b5e8
```

2025-06-11 21:21:02,978 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.16s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (e8), Bishop (c1), King (g1), 7 pawns
- Black: Knight (e7), King (c4), 6 pawns

**Position:**
- White is up a full rook and bishop for a knight, with a dominating position.
- Black's king is exposed on c4, and White's pieces are extremely active.
- White's bishop on e8 is very strong, cutting off the Black king's escape to d7 and f7.
- Black's knight on e7 is passive.
- White has a clear material and positional advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e8f7**: Bishop attacks the pawn on g7 and threatens to invade the 7th rank.
2. **e8d7**: Bishop attacks the a4 pawn and controls more squares.
3. **e8g6**: Bishop attacks the h7 pawn.
4. **e8c6**: Bishop attacks the b7 pawn.
5. **e8h5**: Bishop attacks the h7 pawn.
6. **e8b5**: Bishop attacks the b7 pawn.
7. **e8a4**: Bishop attacks the a4 pawn.
8. **g1h2**: King move, but not urgent.
9. **g1g2**: King move, not urgent.
10. **e4e5**: Pawn advance, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
11. **h3h4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
12. **g3g4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
13. **d2d3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
14. **c2c3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
15. **b2b3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
16. **a2a3**: Pawn move, not urgent.
17. **d2d4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
18. **b2b4**: Pawn move, not urgent.
19. **a2a4**: Pawn move, not urgent.

**Tactical considerations:**
- Black's king is cut off from the queenside by the bishop on e8.
- White can invade with the rook via b4 or b5.
- Bishop moves like e8-b5 or e8-c6 threaten to win more pawns and further restrict Black's king.

**Best move:**
- **e8b5** is very strong: it attacks the b7 pawn, threatens to invade with the rook, and keeps the Black king boxed in.
- **e8c6** is also strong, but b5 is more direct and keeps the king cut off.
- **e8f7** is less effective, as it doesn't threaten immediate progress.

**Final move:**
```
e8b5
```

2025-06-11 21:21:50,934 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.57s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), King (g1), 7 pawns (a2, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3)
- Black: King (b5), Knight (e7), 6 pawns (a7, b7, d2, g7, h7, f7)

**Key features:**
- White is up a rook and bishop for a knight, and has a clear material advantage.
- Black's king is exposed on b5.
- White's rook and bishop are active, and White has a healthy pawn structure.
- Black's knight is on e7, not threatening anything immediate.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a2a4+**: Immediate check, driving the king to a4 or c6.
2. **b2b3+**: Immediate check, king must move to a3 or a5.
3. **c2c3+**: Immediate check, king must move to a4 or c5.
4. **d2d3**: Develops, but not urgent.
5. **e4e5**: Advances, but not urgent.
6. **g3g4**: Not urgent.
7. **h3h4**: Not urgent.

**Analysis of checks:**

- **a2a4+**: If ...Kxa4, then Ra1# is mate. If ...Kc6, then Ba3 is mate.
- **b2b3+**: If ...Ka3, then Ra1# is mate. If ...Kc5, then Ba3# is mate.
- **c2c3+**: If ...Ka4, then Ra1# is mate. If ...Kc5, then Ba3# is mate.

All three pawn checks seem to lead to mate in one after the king moves to the a-file.

Let's check **a2a4+**:
- 1. a4+ Kxa4 2. Ra1# (mate)
- 1. a4+ Kc6 2. Ba3 (mate)

Let's check **b2b3+**:
- 1. b3+ Ka3 2. Ra1# (mate)
- 1. b3+ Kc5 2. Ba3# (mate)

Let's check **c2c3+**:
- 1. c3+ Ka4 2. Ra1# (mate)
- 1. c3+ Kc5 2. Ba3# (mate)

All three pawn checks are mate in two. Let's pick the most forcing and direct: **a2a4+**.

**Final move:**
```
a2a4
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns (a4, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4), King (g1)
- Black: Knight (e7), pawns (a7, b7, g7, h7), King (c6)

**Positional factors:**
- White is up a rook and bishop for a knight, a decisive material advantage.
- Black's king is exposed on c6.
- White's a4 pawn is advanced and can become a passed pawn.
- Black's knight on e7 is passive.
- White's king is safe on g1.
- White's rook and bishop are ready to activate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a4-a5**: Advance the passed pawn, threatening a6 and further progress.
2. **g3-g4**: Gain space on the kingside, but not urgent.
3. **h3-h4**: Same as above.
4. **d2-d4**: Open the center, but Black's king is already exposed.
5. **c2-c3**: Prepare to bring the bishop to a3 or support d4.
6. **b1-b3**: Activate the rook, possibly to b5 or b7.
7. **g1-h2**: King move, not urgent.
8. **e4-e5**: Gain space, but not urgent.

**Critical analysis:**
- The most pressing plan is to activate the rook and bishop and push the a-pawn.
- **a5** is strong, but Black can try ...b6, but then a6 is still strong.
- **Rb3** is tempting, attacking the knight and preparing to double on the b-file or invade the 7th rank.
- **Bishop activation**: Bxa3 is not possible yet, but c1-a3 could be a plan after c3.

**Tactics:**
- Black has no immediate threats.
- White can play for a5, then Rb3, then a6, and the a-pawn will be unstoppable.

**Best move:**
- **a5** is the most direct and powerful, pushing the passed pawn and tying Black down.

**Final move:**
```
a5

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 6n1/pp4pp/2k5/P7/4P3/6PP/1PPP4/1RB3K1 w - - 1 39

**Material count:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns on a5, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, King (g1)
- Black: Knight (g8), pawns on a7, b7, g7, h7, King (c6)

**Positional factors:**
- White is up a full rook for a knight.
- White has a passed a-pawn on a5, ready to advance.
- Black's king is centralized but has no pawn cover.
- Black's knight is on g8, far from the action.
- White's rook and bishop are ready to activate.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a5-a6**: Push the passed pawn, threatening to advance further. Black cannot stop the pawn easily.
2. **b2-b4**: Prepare to support the a-pawn, but not urgent.
3. **d2-d4**: Central break, but not necessary.
4. **g3-g4**: Not urgent, doesn't help the plan.
5. **Bishop moves**: Bc1-a3 or Bc1-b2, but not needed yet.
6. **King moves**: Not urgent.
7. **Rook moves**: Rb1-b3 or Rb1-b4, but pawn push is stronger.

**Tactical considerations:**
- Black's king is cut off from the queenside.
- Black's knight is out of play.
- Advancing the a-pawn is the fastest way to win.

**Best move:**
- **a5-a6** is the most direct and powerful. It threatens a7-a8=Q, and Black cannot stop the pawn without heavy material loss.

**Final move:**
```
a5a6

2025-06-11 21:24:10,111 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.14s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns on a6, b2, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4, King (g1)
- Black: Knight (e7), pawns on a7, b7, g7, h7, King (c6)

**Position:**
- White is up a rook and bishop for a knight, and has a dangerous passed pawn on a6.
- Black's king is centralized but exposed.
- White's king is safe.
- White's rook and bishop are not yet active, but can be quickly mobilized.
- Black's knight is on e7, not threatening anything immediate.
- Black's only hope is to try to stop the a6 pawn or create counterplay with the king and knight.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a6-a7: Push the passed pawn. Threatens a8=Q next move. Black can try ...Nc8, but then Rxb7 wins material.
2. Rb1-b3: Activate the rook, possibly to c3 or b7.
3. Bc1-b2: Develop bishop, possibly to support the pawn.
4. e4-e5: Gain space, but not urgent.
5. h3-h4 or g3-g4: Not urgent.
6. King moves: Not urgent.

**Critical lines:**
- If 1. a7, Black must stop the pawn. Only move is ...Nc8.
- After 1. a7 Nc8, White can play Rxb7, threatening Rb8 and a8=Q.
- If Black tries ...Kc7, then a8=Q wins.

**Calculation:**
1. a7 Nc8
2. Rxb7 (threatening Rb8 and a8=Q)
   - If Kc5, then Rb8, and Black cannot stop a8=Q.
   - If Nb6, then Rxb6 Kxb6, a8=Q wins.

**Conclusion:**
- The move a7 is extremely strong, pushing the pawn to the 7th rank and threatening to queen. Black's only defense is ...Nc8, but then Rxb7 wins material and the game.

**Final move:**
```
a6a7
```

Thank you for pointing out the error and providing the list of legal moves. Let's re-evaluate the position with only the legal moves:

**Legal moves:**
- g1h2
- g1g2
- g1f2
- g1h1
- g1f1
- b1a1
- a6b7
- e4e5
- h3h4
- g3g4
- d2d3
- c2c3
- b2b3
- d2d4
- c2c4
- b2b4

**Analysis:**

- The move **a6b7** captures a pawn and creates a passed pawn on the b-file, which is very strong and will be hard for Black to stop.
- Other pawn moves (e4-e5, h3-h4, g3-g4, etc.) are not urgent or decisive.
- King moves are not urgent.
- Rook and bishop are not under threat and do not have active moves.
- **a6b7** is the most forcing and creates a dangerous passed pawn.

**Best move:**
```
a6b7
```

2025-06-11 21:24:59,743 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.10s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns on b7, c2, d2, e4, g3, h3, h4, King (g1)
- Black: King (c6), pawns on a7, h7, g7, Bishop (none), Rook (none), Queen (none), Knight (g8)

**Key features:**
- White has a pawn on b7, ready to promote.
- Black's king is on c6, far from the b7 pawn.
- Black's knight is on g8, unable to stop the b7 pawn.
- White's rook and bishop are active.
- White is completely winning.

**Candidate moves:**
1. b7-b8=Q (promote to queen)
2. b7-b8=R (promote to rook)
3. b7-b8=B (promote to bishop)
4. b7-b8=N (promote to knight)
5. Other pawn moves (not urgent)
6. King moves (not urgent)
7. Rook or bishop moves (not urgent)

**Analysis:**
- Promoting the b7 pawn is the most forcing move.
- Promotion to queen is standard and decisive.
- Black cannot stop the new queen, and there are no perpetual checks or stalemate tricks.
- Promotion to rook or bishop is unnecessary.
- Promotion to knight is not useful.

**Check for stalemate:**
- After b8=Q, Black's king is on c6, Black has pawns on a7, h7, g7, knight on g8. Black has moves.

**Final decision:**
The best move is to promote the b7 pawn to a queen.

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (b8), Rook (c1), Bishop (b1), pawns on e4, g3, h3, c2, d2, b2  
- Black: King (c6), Knight (e7), pawns on a7, g7, h7

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on c6.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**  
- White threatens Qb7# (mate in one).
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate Moves:**  
- Qb7# is checkmate, as the Black king on c6 has no escape squares and nothing can block or capture the queen.

**Verification:**  
- Black king: c6  
- Squares b7, c7, d7, b6, d6, b5, c5, d5 are all covered or occupied.  
- No Black piece can block or capture on b7.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is checkmate in one:

```

2025-06-11 21:25:47,378 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 14.02s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (b7), Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns (e4, g3, h3, c2, d2, f2)
- Black: Knight (e7), pawns (a7, g7, h7, d2, c2, b7, f7), King (b7)

**White to move.**

**King safety:**  
- Black's king is on b7, exposed.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**
- White's queen is very active on b7, attacking b7 and potentially the 7th rank.
- Black's knight on e7 is not threatening anything immediate.
- Black's only hope is to try to activate the knight or push pawns, but White's material advantage is overwhelming.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxb7+**: This is an immediate check, and after Kxb7, White can play Rxb7+, winning the king and the game.
2. **Qd7+**: Another check, but less forcing.
3. **Qb4+**: Check, but Black can block with Ka8.
4. **Qd6+**: Check, but Black can play Ka8.
5. **b3**: Defends the c4 square, but not urgent.
6. **e5**: Not urgent.

**Calculation:**
- **Qxb7+** Kxb7 Rxb7+ Kc6 Rxe7 wins the knight and leaves White with a rook, bishop, and pawns vs. nothing. This is a trivial win.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- After Qxb7+ Kxb7 Rxb7+ Kc6 Rxe7, Black is completely lost.
- Alternatively, after Qxb7+, if Black plays Ka8, then Qb8# is mate.

But after Qxb7+, Black must play Kxb7.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is the immediate capture:

```
b7b7
```

```
b7b7

2025-06-11 21:25:53,720 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.34s):
Thank you for your patience. Let's clarify the position and the best move.

**Current FEN:**
8/pk2n1pp/8/8/4P3/6PP/1PPP4/1RB3K1 w - - 0 43

**White to move.**

**Legal moves:**
g1h2, g1g2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1, b1a1, e4e5, h3h4, g3g4, d2d3, c2c3, b2b3, d2d4, c2c4, b2b4

**Analysis:**
- White is up a queen, rook, and bishop for a knight.
- Black's king is on b7, knight on e7, pawns on a7, g7, h7.
- White's queen is on b7, rook on b1, bishop on c1.

**Immediate tactics:**
- White's queen on b7 is protected by the rook on b1.
- Black's king is on b7, so Qxb7 is not possible (the queen is already on b7).
- The queen cannot move, as there is no queen on another square.

**So, the queen is already on b7.**

**What is the best move?**
- White can play Rxb7+ (rook on b1 to b7), which is check, and after Kc8 (forced), Rxb7 wins the knight or forces mate soon.
- But the rook is on b1, and b7 is occupied by the queen. So Rxb7 is not possible.

**So, let's look at the legal moves:**
- King moves: g1h2, g1g2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1
- Rook move: b1a1
- Pawn moves: e4e5, h3h4, g3g4, d2d3, c2c3, b2b3, d2d4, c2c4, b2b4

**What is the best plan?**
- White is completely winning. The best is to improve position, restrict Black, and prepare to bring the king or bishop in.
- e4-e5 is a strong centralizing move, restricting the knight and preparing to play Ba3 or Ba3-d6.
- h3-h4 and g3-g4 are slow.
- b2-b3 or c2-c3 are not urgent.

**e4-e5** is the most active, restricting the knight and preparing to bring the bishop to a3 or d6.

**Final move:**
```
e4e5

2025-06-11 21:26:32,591 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.54s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Position Overview:**
- White: King on g1, rook on b1, bishop on c1, queen on b7, pawns on d2, c2, b2, h3, g3, h4, e5.
- Black: King on b7, knight on g8, pawns on a7, h7, g7.

**Material:**
- White is up a queen for a knight and has a dominating position.

**Threats and Plans:**
- White threatens to invade with the queen and rook.
- Black's king is exposed on b7.
- Black's knight on g8 is passive.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qd5+**: Immediate check, king must move to c8 or a6.
2. **Qb3+**: Check, king must move to a8 or c8.
3. **Qf7**: Threatens mate on b7, but not immediate.
4. **e6**: Pushes pawn, but not urgent.
5. **Rb2**: Prepares to double on the 7th, but not urgent.
6. **d4**: Opens up the center, but not urgent.

**Calculation:**
- **Qd5+**:
    - If Kc8, then Qxg8 wins the knight.
    - If Ka6, then Qb5# is mate.

- **Qb3+**:
    - If Ka8, then Qxg8 wins the knight.
    - If Kc8, then Qxg8.

- **e6**: Not urgent, as checks are stronger.

**Best Move:**
- **Qd5+** is the strongest, as it forces the king to a6, and then Qb5# is mate.

**Check:**
1. Qd5+ Ka6 (forced)
2. Qb5# (mate)

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
Qd5+
```
But in UCI notation, the move is:
```
b7d5
```

Thank you for your patience and for pointing out the legal moves. Let's carefully analyze the position again, considering only the legal moves:

**Legal moves:**
- g1h2
- g1g2
- g1f2
- g1h1
- g1f1
- b1a1
- e5e6
- h3h4
- g3g4
- d2d3
- c2c3
- b2b3
- d2d4
- c2c4
- b2b4

**Position assessment:**
- White is up a queen for a knight, with a dominating position.
- Black's king is on b7, knight on g8, pawns on a7, g7, h7.
- White's queen is on b7, rook on b1, bishop on c1, pawns on b2, c2, d2, e5, g3, h3, king on g1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e5e6**: Pushes the passed pawn, threatens e6-e7 and e7-e8=Q, and opens lines for the bishop.
2. **h3h4** or **g3g4**: Not urgent, doesn't create immediate threats.
3. **d2d3**, **c2c3**, **b2b3**, **d2d4**, **c2c4**, **b2b4**: Pawn moves, but not urgent.
4. **King moves**: Not urgent.
5. **b1a1**: Rook move, but doesn't improve position.

**Analysis:**
- **e5e6** is the most aggressive and logical move. It threatens to push e7, and if Black does nothing, White can play e7 and then e8=Q, or open lines for the bishop to join the attack.
- Black has no checks or threats. The knight is far from the action, and the king is exposed.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
e5e6
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (b7), Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns (d2, c2, h3, g3, h4, e6)
- Black: King (b7), Knight (e7), pawns (a7, g7, h7)

**White to move.**

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on b7.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**
- White's queen is extremely powerful on b7, controlling the 7th rank and threatening to invade.
- Black's knight is on e7, but it cannot defend the king.
- White's e6 pawn is very strong, threatening to advance or support an attack.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b7b5+**: Queen check. King must move to a6 or c8.
2. **d2d4**: Opens the bishop, but not urgent.
3. **g3g4**: Not urgent.
4. **h3h4**: Not urgent.
5. **c2c4**: Not urgent.
6. **b1b3+**: Rook check, but the queen is more powerful.
7. **b1b5**: Rook to b5, but not a check.

**Let's calculate b7b5+:**
- 1. b7b5+ Ka8 (only move)
- Now, 2. Qb7 (back to b7) is repetition.
- But after Ka8, White can play Qb7 again, but that's repetition.
- Alternatively, after b7b5+ Ka8, White can try d2d4, but that's slow.

**What about b7b5+ Kc8?**
- 1. b7b5+ Kc8
- 2. Qb7+ Kd8
- 3. Qb8+ Nc8
- 4. Qxc8+ Kxc8
- White loses the queen for the knight, but then has Rb8# (if the bishop is on a3). But currently, the bishop is on c1.

**What about d2d4?**
- Prepares to develop the bishop, but not urgent.

**What about b1b7?**
- Rook to b7, but not a check.

**What about c1a3?**
- Not legal.

**What about h3h4 or g3g4?**
- Not urgent.

**What about b1b3+?**
- 1. b1b3+ Ka8 (only move)
- 2. Qb7# is checkmate.

**Let's check this:**
- 1. b1b3+ Ka8
- 2. Qb7# (queen is protected by rook on b3)

**This is a forced mate in 2!**

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b1b3
```
2025-06-11 21:27:04,068 - WARNING - Illegal move: b1b3 is not a legal move in the current position. Please choose another one. Note that we have give you all legal moves.

Thank you for your correction and for providing the list of legal moves.

Let’s re-examine the position and the legal moves:

**Legal moves:**
- g1h2
- g1g2
- g1f2
- g1h1
- g1f1
- b1a1
- h3h4
- g3g4
- d2d3
- c2c3
- b2b3
- d2d4
- c2c4
- b2b4

**Position assessment:**
- White is up a queen and has a passed pawn on e6.
- Black’s king is on b7, knight on e7, pawns on a7, g7, h7.
- White’s king is safe, and Black has no counterplay.

**Best plan:** 
- Improve piece activity, push passed pawns, and prepare to bring the bishop into play for a decisive attack or promotion.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d2d4**: Opens the bishop and supports e6-e7, threatening to bring the bishop to a3 or b2.
2. **c2c4**: Similar idea, but d4 is more direct.
3. **h3h4** or **g3g4**: Not urgent.
4. **King moves**: Not urgent.
5. **b2b3**: Prepares c4, but d4 is more direct.

**Calculation after d2d4:**
- If Black does nothing, White can play Ba3 or Bf4, then push e7 and promote.
- Black has no checks or threats.

**Conclusion:**  
**d2d4** is the best move, opening the bishop and preparing to push e7.

My move:
```
d2d4

2025-06-11 21:27:50,017 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 8.98s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Queen (b7), Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns (d4, e6, g3, h3, c2, b2)  
Black: King (g8), Bishop (none), Rook (none), pawns (a7, g7, h7)  

White is up a queen for a bishop and is completely winning. The Black king is on g8, and White's queen is on b7, rook on b1, bishop on c1. White has a passed pawn on e6, and Black's king is boxed in with no counterplay.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can play e7, threatening to promote.
- White can also play d5, supporting e6-e7.
- White can play Qf7+ or Qb8+ to drive the king to h8 and then try to mate.
- White can play c4, supporting d5 and e6.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7**: Threatens to promote, but Black can play Kf7, but then Qd5+ wins.
2. **Qb7xb7**: Not possible, queen is already on b7.
3. **Qb7xb8**: Not possible.
4. **Qb7f7+**: King goes to h8, then e7-e8=Q is unstoppable.
5. **d5**: Prepares e7, but e7 is already possible.
6. **c4**: Not urgent.
7. **g3g4**: Not urgent.
8. **h3h4**: Not urgent.

**Check for forced mate:**
- Qf7+ Kc6 (only move), then Qd7# is mate, but king is on g8, not c6.
- Qf7+ Kh8, then e7-e8=Q is unstoppable.

But let's check Qf7+:

1. Qf7+ Kh8 (forced)
2. e7-e8=Q h6 (only pawn move)
3. Qxg8# (if Black plays h6, White can mate with Qxg8#)

But after Qf7+, Black can only play Kh8. Then e7-e8=Q is unstoppable.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- Qb7xb7 is not a move.
- Qb7f7+ is the most forcing.

**Let's check e7:**
- e7 threatens e8=Q, Black has no checks, no way to stop promotion.

**Let's check for stalemate traps:**
- After e7, Black has no moves except g7-g6, h7-h6, or king moves.
- After e7, Black can play g7-g6, but then Qxb7 is still winning.

**Conclusion:**  
The most forcing and cleanest move is:
```
Qf7+
```
This forces the Black king to h8, and then e7-e8=Q is unstoppable, with mate to follow. 

So, the best move is:
```
b7f7
```

Thank you for your patience and for pointing out the legal moves. Let’s carefully analyze the position again, considering only the legal moves:

**Legal moves:**
- g1h2
- g1g2
- g1f2
- g1h1

- c1h6
- c1g5

- e6e7
- d4d5
- h3h4
- g3g4
- c2c3
- b2b3
- c2c4
- b2b4

**Position summary:**
- White is up a queen and completely winning.
- Black’s king is on g8, with pawns on a7, g7, h7.
- White’s e6 pawn is ready to advance.
- No immediate threats from Black.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6e7**: Pushes the pawn, threatening to promote next move. Black cannot stop promotion.
2. **d4d5**: Supports e6, but e6e7 is more direct.
3. **h3h4 / g3g4**: Not urgent.
4. **c1h6**: Develops bishop, but not urgent.
5. **b1a1**: Rook move, not urgent.
6. **c2c4 / b2b4**: Not urgent.

**Analysis:**
- After **e6e7**, Black cannot stop e8=Q. Black has no checks, and no way to create counterplay.
- All other moves are slower.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is the most direct and decisive:

```
e6e7

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-11 21:28:30,536 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 21:28:43,807 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 13.27s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (b7), Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns (d4, c2, b2, h3, g3, g1), King (g1)
- Black: Knight (e7), pawns (a7, g7, h7), King (b7)

**King safety:**
- White's king is safe on g1.
- Black's king is exposed on b7.

**Threats:**
- White is up a queen for a knight and is completely winning.
- Black has no immediate threats.
- White can press for mate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxb7+**: Immediate check. Black must play Ka8 or Kc8.
2. **Bishop moves**: Not threatening much immediately.
3. **d5**: Opens up the bishop, but not urgent.
4. **h4/g4**: Not urgent.
5. **b3/c3/c4**: Not urgent.

**Calculation:**
- Qxb7+ is forcing. After Ka8, White can play Bf4 (threatening mate with Qb8#), or Qb8+ Ka6 Qb6#.
- Let's check Qxb7+ Ka8 Qb8+ Ka7 Qb6+ Ka8 Qb8# (mate).

So, Qxb7+ is a forced mate in a few moves.

**Final move:**

Thank you for your patience. Let's carefully analyze the position and select a legal move in proper UCI format.

**FEN:**  
8/pk2n1pp/8/8/3P4/6PP/1PP5/1RB3K1 w - - 0 47

**White to move.**

**Legal moves:**
- g1h2, g1g2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1
- c1h6, c1g5, c1f4, c1e3, c1d2
- b1a1
- d4d5
- h3h4
- g3g4
- c2c3
- b2b3
- c2c4
- b2b4

**Analysis:**
- White is up a queen, rook, bishop, and several pawns against a knight and a few pawns.
- Black's king is on b7, White's queen is on b7, rook on b1, bishop on c1.
- The most forcing moves are checks, but there are no immediate checks.
- The next best plan is to activate pieces and restrict Black's knight and king.

**Best move:**
- The move **d4-d5** opens the diagonal for the bishop and prepares to bring more pieces into the attack. It also restricts the knight and gives White more options.

**Final move:**
```
d4d5

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (b7), Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns (d5, c2, b2, h3, g3, h3, h4)
- Black: King (b7), Knight (g8), pawns (a7, h7, g7)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on b7, White's queen is very active.
- Black's knight is on g8, not participating in defense.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**
- White threatens Qxb7+ or Qc6+ ideas, but the queen is already on b7.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **d5-d6**: Pushes the passed pawn, threatens d7 and d8=Q. Black cannot stop the pawn easily.
2. **Qxg7**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't threaten immediate mate.
3. **Rb1-b3**: Prepares to swing the rook to the kingside, but is slow.
4. **Bishop moves**: Not immediately threatening.
5. **King moves**: Not urgent.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- After d6, if Black plays Kc8, then Qc7# is mate.
- If Black plays Ka8, then Qc8# is mate.
- If Black plays Kc6, then Qc7# is mate.
- Black's knight is too far to help.

**Calculation:**
- 1. d6! If Black plays Ka8, then Qc8#.
- If Black plays Kc8, then Qc7#.
- If Black plays Kc6, then Qc7#.
- If Black does nothing, d7 is coming and d8=Q is unstoppable.

**Conclusion:**
The move **d6** is crushing and threatens immediate mate or queening. Black cannot stop both threats.

**Final move:**
```
d5d6

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

---

### **FEN Notation:**
```
6n1/pk4pp/3P4/8/8/6PP/1PP5/1RB3K1 b - - 0 48
```

You are playing as **Black**.  
The material balance is roughly equal, but both sides have limited pieces. White has a rook and pawns; Black has a knight and pawns.

---

### **Key Observations:**

- **White's king is in the corner (g1)**, which could be vulnerable.
- **Black's knight on g8 is very passive**, but it can become active with precise maneuvering.
- **White has dangerous passed pawns on the queenside (b2, c2, b3)**, especially since Black’s king is far from them.
- **Black’s king is relatively safe**, and Black has a pawn on a7 that could promote if given time.
- **Black must activate the knight quickly** to prevent White from promoting first.
- The game is likely decided by **who promotes first**, or who can deliver checkmate first.

---

### **Legal Moves for Black:**

```
g8e7, g8h6, g8f6, b7c8, b7b8, b7a8, b7c6, b7b6, b7a6, h7h6, g7g6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, a7a5
```

We’ll evaluate each candidate move:

---

## 🔍 Candidate Move Analysis

### 1. **...g8-e7 (Best Move)**
- Develops the knight actively.
- Knight eyes squares like d5, f5, or even c6 later.
- Keeps options open for further tactical play.
- Prepares to support ...a5 or ...a6 to push the a-pawn.
- This move develops the only inactive piece and keeps pressure on the center.

### 2. **...g8-h6**
- Very passive placement for the knight.
- Nh6 doesn't help in either attacking or defending.
- Wastes tempo.

### 3. **...g8-f6**
- Slightly better than Nh6, but still not ideal.
- Nf6 could go to e4 or d5 eventually, but slower than Ne7.

### 4. **...b7-b8**
- King moves away from the center — dangerous.
- Exposes the king more and gives White initiative.

### 5. **...b7-c8 / ...b7-a8**
- Also poor king moves, losing control of key squares.

### 6. **...b7-c6 / ...b7-b6 / ...b7-a6**
- Moving the king forward might help central activity, but exposes the king unnecessarily.
- Too risky in this sharp position.

### 7. **...h7-h6 / ...g7-g6 / ...h7-h5 / ...g7-g5**
- Pawn moves that don’t develop anything.
- Give White time to improve their position.

### 8. **...a7-a6**
- Awaiting move, prepares ...a5, but too slow.
- Doesn’t solve the issue of the inactive knight.

---

## ✅ Best Move:
Activating the knight is critical. **Ne7** is the most logical and strongest move here.

It brings the knight into the game, supports future ...a5 pushes, and allows Black to start coordinating a plan to promote the a-pawn before White can do the same with their queenside pawns.

---

## 🧠 Long-Term Plan After ...Ne7:
- Play ...a5, ...a6, ...a4, aiming to create a passed a-pawn.
- Use the knight to block or harass White’s queenside pawns.
- Possibly bring the king over to support the a-pawn.
- Prevent White from advancing their own passed pawns unchallenged.

---

## Final Move:
```
g8e7

2025-06-11 21:30:14,573 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.55s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), Queen (b7), pawns (d6, c2, b2, h3, g3, h4), King (g1)
- Black: Knight (e7), pawns (a7, g7, h7), King (b7)

**White's advantages:**
- White is up a queen for a knight and has a passed pawn on d6.
- Black's king is exposed and White's queen is very active.
- Black's knight is tied to defense and cannot stop all threats.

**Immediate threats:**
- White can play d6-d7, threatening d7-d8=Q.
- Black's king is on b7, so back-rank mates or checks are possible.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. d6-d7: Threatens d7-d8=Q, but Black can play Nc6, blocking the pawn.
2. Qxe7: Captures the knight, but after Kc8, White is still winning but not as fast.
3. Qb5+: Forces the king to a8 or c8, but doesn't immediately win.
4. Qc7+: Forces the king to a8 or a6, but again, not immediately decisive.
5. Qc8+: If Kxc8, d7-d8=Q is mate, but the king is not on c8.
6. Qd7+: If Kc8, Qc7# is mate.

**Let's check Qd7+:**
- Qd7+ Kb8 (only move)
- Qc7+ Ka8 (only move)
- Qc8+ Nxc8 (forced)
- d7xc8=Q#

But after Qd7+, if Kb6, then Qc7+ Ka6, Qc8+ Nxc8, d7xc8=Q#.

But after Qd7+, Black's only move is Kb8.

So let's check Qd7+ Kb8 Qc7+ Ka8 Qc8+ Nxc8 d7xc8=Q#

But after Qd7+, if Kb6, Qc7+ Ka6, Qc8+ Nxc8, d7xc8=Q#

But after Qd7+, if Ka8, Qc8+ Nxc8, d7xc8=Q#

So Qd7+ is a forced mate in a few moves.

**Final move:**
```
Qd7+

When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```

2025-06-11 21:30:54,796 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 21:31:01,934 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.14s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3Q4/pk2n1pp/8/8/8/6PP/1PP5/1RB3K1 w - - 1 51

- White: Queen on d8, Rook on b1, Bishop on c1, King on g1, pawns on b2, c2, g3, h3.
- Black: King on b7, Knight on e7, pawns on a7, g7, h7.

**Material:** White is up a queen and rook for a knight, and has a huge material advantage.

**Immediate threats:** 
- Black's king is exposed on b7.
- Black's knight on e7 is pinned by the queen on d8.
- White can check on d7 or d8, but let's look for the fastest mate or decisive material gain.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qd7+**: Forces the king to a8 or b6 (if b6, then Qd6+ wins the knight).
2. **Qxe7**: Captures the knight, but let's see if there's a forced mate.
3. **Qd5+**: King only has c8 or b6.
4. **Qd8+**: Not a check, but covers the 8th rank.
5. **Rb1**: Not a check, but could threaten mate on b7.

**Check for mate:**
- **Qd7+**: If Kb6, then Qd6+ wins the knight and keeps up the attack. If Ka8, then Qxe7 wins the knight with check.
- **Qxe7**: Just wins the knight, but not a check.

**Let's check Qd7+:**
- 1. Qd7+ Kb6 (if Ka8, Qxe7 wins the knight with check)
- 2. Qd6+ Nc6 (forced, otherwise Qxe7+ wins the knight)
- 3. Be3+ Ka5 (if Ka6, Qxc6#)
- 4. Qa3#

But let's check if there's a faster mate.

**Qd7+ Kb6 Qd6+ Nc6 Be3+ Ka5 Qa3#** is mate in 4.

Alternatively, **Qd7+ Ka8 Qxe7** wins the knight with check, and then White will mate soon.

**Conclusion:** The move **Qd7+** is the most forcing, and leads to a quick mate or decisive material gain.

**Final move:**
```
d7d7
```

But in UCI notation, that's **d8d7**.

So the correct move is:
```
d8d7
```

2025-06-11 21:31:12,213 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.96s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (d7), Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns (b2, c2, g3, h3), King (g1)
- Black: Knight (e7), pawns (a7, g7, h7), King (b6)

**White to move.**

**King safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on b6.
- White's queen is very active on d7, and Black's knight on e7 is passive.
- White has a huge material advantage (queen, rook, bishop vs knight).

**Immediate threats:**
- White can check on b5, d6, d8, etc.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qd7d6+**: Check, forces Black's king to a5 or a7.
2. **Qd7b5+**: Check, king must go to c7 or a6.
3. **Qd7d8**: Check, king must go to a5 or a7.
4. **Qd7e7**: Trade queens for knight, but unnecessary.
5. **Qd7e8**: Check, king must go to a5 or a7.

Let's check **Qd7d6+**:
- 1. Qd6+ Ka5 (if Kb7, then Qxe7 wins the knight)
- 2. Qxe7 wins the knight.

But let's look for a forced mate.

**Qd7b5+**:
- 1. Qb5+ Kc7 (if Ka6, then Qb7# is mate)
- 2. Qb7# is mate if Ka6.

So, **Qb5+** forces mate in one if the king goes to a6.

Let's check:
1. Qb5+ Ka6 Qb7# (mate)
2. Qb5+ Kc7 (then Qb7+ wins the knight or mates soon)

So, **Qb5+** is the fastest way to mate.

**Final move:**
```
d7b5

2025-06-11 21:31:26,692 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.96s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (b5), Rook (c1), Bishop (b1), pawns on b2, c2, g3, h3, King (g1)
- Black: King (c7), Knight (e7), pawns on a7, g7, h7

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on c7, with no pawn cover and limited escape squares.
- White's king is very safe on g1.

**Threats:**
- White threatens to invade with the queen and rook.
- Black's knight is passive and cannot defend the king well.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qe8+** (b5e8): Forces the king to move, as the knight cannot block.
   - If Kd6, then Qb8+ wins the knight or mates soon.
   - If Kb7, then Qxe7 wins the knight.
2. **Qb7+** (b5b7): Forces the king to a6 or d6.
   - If Kd6, then Qb4+ is strong.
   - If Kc8, then Qb8# is mate.
3. **Qd7+** (b5d7): Forces the king to b8 or c8.
   - If Kb8, then Qb7# is mate.
   - If Kc8, then Qc7# is mate.
4. **Qb8+** (b5b8): If Kd7, then Qb7+.
5. **Qe5+** (b5e5): Checks, but less forcing.

**Calculation:**
- Let's check **Qd7+**:
  - If Kb8, then Qb7# is mate.
  - If Kc8, then Qc7# is mate.
  - If Kb6, not possible.
  - If Kd8, not possible.

So **Qd7+** is a forced mate in one or two.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
b5d7

2025-06-11 21:31:40,248 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.78s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (d7), Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns on b2, c2, g3, h3, King (g1)
- Black: Knight (e7), pawns on a7, g7, h7, King (b6)

**White's advantages:**
- White is up a queen and rook for a knight.
- Black's king is exposed on b6.
- Black's knight is on e7, but not threatening anything immediate.
- Black's pawns are not dangerous.

**Immediate threats:**
- White can check with Qd7-b5+ or Qd7-d6+.
- White can also play Qd7-e6+.
- White can try to coordinate with the rook and bishop for mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qd7-b5+ (forces the king to a6 or c7)
2. Qd7-d6+ (forces the king to a5 or b7)
3. Qd7-e6+ (forces the king to a5 or c5)
4. Qd7-e8 (threatens Qe8xe7, but not a check)
5. Qd7-d8 (not a check, but threatens Qd8xe7)
6. Qd7-c7 (not a check, but threatens Qc7xe7)
7. Qd7-b7 (not a check, but threatens Qb7xe7)
8. Qd7-e7 (captures the knight, but not a check)

Let's check the checks first:

**1. Qd7-b5+**
- If Kc7, then Qb7+ wins the knight and keeps the king boxed.
- If Ka6, then Ra1# is mate.

**2. Qd7-d6+**
- If Ka5, then Ra1# is mate.
- If Kb7, then Qxe7 wins the knight.

**3. Qd7-e6+**
- If Ka5, then Ra1# is mate.
- If Kc5, then Qxe7 wins the knight.

**Let's check Qd7-b5+ in detail:**
- 1. Qb5+ Ka6 2. Ra1# is mate.

**Let's check Qd7-d6+:**
- 1. Qd6+ Ka5 2. Ra1# is mate.

**Let's check Qd7-e6+:**
- 1. Qe6+ Ka5 2. Ra1# is mate.

So, all three moves (Qb5+, Qd6+, Qe6+) lead to mate in two if the king goes to a5 or a6. But Qb5+ is the most forcing, as it only allows Ka6 or Kc7.

- 1. Qb5+ Kc7 2. Qb7+ Kd6 3. Qxe7+ wins the knight and the game is over.

But 1. Qb5+ Ka6 2. Ra1# is immediate mate.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
d7b5

2025-06-11 21:31:55,528 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.10s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (b5), Rook (c1), Bishop (b1), pawns (b2, c2, g3, h3), King (g1)
- Black: King (c7), Knight (e7), pawns (a7, g7, h7)

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on c7, with no pawn cover.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**  
- White threatens to invade with the queen and rook.
- Black's knight on e7 is passive, and Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qe8+**: Forces the king to b6 or d6, but after Kd6, White can play Qb8+ and pick up the knight.
2. **Qb7+**: Forces the king to d6 or c8.
3. **Qd7+**: Forces the king to b6 or c8.
4. **Qb4**: Not forcing.
5. **Qb3**: Not forcing.
6. **Qe5+**: King must go to d8 or c8, but after Kd8, Qb8+ picks up the knight.

Let's calculate **Qe8+**:

- 1. Qe8+ Kd6 (if Kb7, then Qd7+ wins the knight)
- 2. Qb8+ Ke6 (if Kc6, Qb7+ wins the knight)
- 3. Qb3+ Kf6 (if Kf5, Qf3# is mate)
- But after Qe8+ Kd6, Qb8+ Kd7, Qb7+ Ke8, Qb8+ Kd7, it's a repetition.

What about **Qb7+**:

- 1. Qb7+ Kd6 (if Kd8, Qb8# is mate)
- 2. Qb4+ Ke6 (if Kc6, Qb7+ wins the knight)
- 3. Qb3+ Kf6 (similar as above)

What about **Qd7+**:

- 1. Qd7+ Kb6 (if Kd8, Qb8# is mate)
- 2. Qd6+ Nc6 (forced), Qxc6+ Kxc6, c3 wins.

But let's check for mate threats.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Qe8+ Kd6, Qb8+ Kd7, Qb7+ Ke8, Qb8+ Kd7, repetition.
- Qd7+ Kb6, Qd6+ Nc6, Qxc6+ Kxc6, c3, White is up a rook and bishop, easily winning.

**Is there a way to win the knight?**
- Qd7+ Kb6, Qd6+ Nc6, Qxc6+ Kxc6, c3, White is up a rook and bishop for a knight, easily winning.

**Is there a mate?**
- Qb8+ Kd7, Qb7+ Ke8, Qb8+ Kd7, repetition.

**Conclusion:**  
The move **Qd7+** forces Black to block with the knight after Kb6, and White wins the knight with Qxc6+, going into a completely winning endgame.

Therefore, the best move is:
```

2025-06-11 21:32:12,925 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.56s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (d7), Rook (b1), Bishop (c1), pawns (b2, c2, g3, h3)
- Black: King (b6), Knight (e7), pawns (a7, g7, h7)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on b6, with no pawn cover.
- White's queen is very active and can deliver checks.
- Black's knight is on e7, but not defending the king directly.
- White's rook and bishop are ready to join the attack.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- White can consider checks with Qd7, but let's see if there is a forced mate or a way to win material.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. Qd7d6+ (check)
2. Qd7b5+ (check)
3. Qd7e7 (captures knight)
4. Qd7d8 (retreat, but not forcing)
5. Qd7b7 (check)
6. Qd7c7 (check)

Let's look at the most forcing moves: checks.

**1. Qd7d6+**
- Black's only legal move is to take with the king: Kb6xd6.
- Then White can play Rb1d1+ (skewer), and after Kd6c7, Rd1d7+ wins the knight on e7.
- But after Qd6+, Kb6xd6, White loses the queen for nothing. Not good.

**2. Qd7b5+**
- Black's only legal move is Kb6c7.
- Then Qb5b7+ forces Kc7d6.
- Then Qb7b4+ forces Kd6e6.
- But Black's king escapes, and White is not making progress.

**3. Qd7e7**
- Captures the knight, but is this safe?
- After Qxe7, Black has no checks or threats. White is up a full piece and can proceed to win easily.

**4. Qd7d8**
- Retreat, not forcing.

**5. Qd7b7+**
- Kb6c5 (only move)
- Then Qb7e7+ (picking up the knight with check), Kc5d4, Qe7e4+ etc. White is winning.

**6. Qd7c7+**
- Kb6a6 (only move)
- Qc7b7+ Ka6a5
- Qb7b5+ Ka5a4
- Qb5b4+ Ka4a3
- Qb4b3+ Ka3a2
- Qb3b2+ Ka2a1
- Qb2a1+ (mate)

**This is a forced checkmate!**

Let's verify:
- 1. Qc7+ Ka6
- 2. Qb7+ Ka5
- 3. Qb5+ Ka4
- 4. Qb4+ Ka3
- 5. Qb3+ Ka2
- 6. Qb2+ Ka1
- 7. Qa1#

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
d7c7

2025-06-11 21:32:25,149 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.94s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (c7), Rook (c1), Bishop (b1), pawns (b2, c2, g3, h3), King (g1)
- Black: King (a6), Knight (e7), pawns (a7, g7, h7)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on a6.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**
- White threatens mate with Qxa7# if the knight moves.
- Black's knight on e7 is currently blocking the a7 pawn from being captured.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qxc7-d6+**: Check, but king can move to b7 or b5.
2. **Qxc7-a7+**: Not possible, knight covers a7.
3. **Qxc7xe7**: Captures knight, but does it lead to mate?
4. **Qxc7-b7**: Not possible, pawn on b7.
5. **Qxc7-c8**: Not useful.
6. **Qxc7-c6**: Not useful.
7. **Qxc7-c5**: Not useful.
8. **Qxc7-f4**: Not useful.
9. **Qxc7-c4**: Not useful.
10. **Qxc7-c3**: Not useful.

**Other moves:**
- h3-h4, g3-g4, c2-c3, b2-b3, c2-c4, b2-b4: All slow, no immediate threat.

**Key Tactical Point:**
- If White plays Qxe7, Black must respond. After Qxe7, Black's only pawn move is g7-g6 or h7-h6, but White can then play c2-c4, threatening mate with Qb7#.

But let's check Qxe7:

1. Qxe7 (White captures knight)
   - If Black plays a7-a6, White plays Qb7#.
   - If Black plays g7-g6 or h7-h6, White can play c2-c4, threatening Qb7#.
   - Black cannot stop Qb7# after c2-c4.

Therefore, **Qxe7** is a clean win.

Let's double-check for any stalemate traps:
- After Qxe7, Black still has pawn moves (g7, h7, a7), so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the knight with check, which leads to a forced mate.

2025-06-11 21:32:32,373 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.23s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (e7), Rook (c1), Bishop (b1), pawns on b2, c2, g3, h3, King (g1)
- Black: King (b5), pawns on a7, g7, h7

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on b5.
- White's queen is very active on e7.
- White's rook and bishop are ready to join the attack.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- White can check on b7 with the queen: Qb7+.
- After Qb7+, Black's king has only one legal move: Ka4.
- Then, White can play Ra1+, and after Kb4, White can play c3+ (supported by the bishop on b1), forcing the king to a3.
- Then, White can play Rxa3# (checkmate).

Let's check this line:
1. Qb7+ Ka4
2. Ra1+ Kb4
3. c3+ Kc4 (if Kb3, then Qb3#)
   - If Kc4, then Qb4# (since the bishop on b1 covers a2 and c2, and the rook covers the a-file).

Alternatively, after c3+, if Kc4, then Qb4# is mate.

**Conclusion:**  
The move Qb7+ leads to a forced mate in a few moves.

**Final move:**
```
e7b7

2025-06-11 21:32:40,921 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.08s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Queen (b7), Rook (c1), Bishop (b1), pawns on c2, b2, g3, h3, King (g1)  
Black: King (c4), pawns on a7, h7, h6

**White to move.**

**King safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on c4.
- White's queen is very active on b7, controlling the c-file and the 7th rank.
- White's rook and bishop are ready to join the attack.
- Black has no immediate threats; White is completely winning.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can try to deliver mate or win more material.
- The Black king is cut off from the b-file by the queen.
- The c-file is open for the rook.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qb3+**: Forces the Black king to move. After ...Kd4, White can play c3+ and drive the king further.
2. **Ba2**: Prepares to bring the bishop to b3 for a check, but less direct.
3. **Qxa7**: Grabs a pawn, but not as forcing.
4. **c3+**: Immediate check, but Black can play Kc5 and the king escapes.
5. **Qf7**: Not as forcing.

**Calculation:**

- **Qb3+**:  
    - If ...Kd4, then c3+ forces the king to e5 or c5.
    - If ...Kb4, then c3+ wins the king.
    - If ...Kd4, c3+ Kd3, White can continue with cxd3.
    - If ...Kd4, c3+ Kd3, Qxd3# is mate.

So, let's check Qb3+:

1. Qb3+ Kd4
2. c3+ Kd3 (if ...Kc5, then Qb4#)
3. Qxd3#

So after Qb3+, Black is forced to move the king, and White can deliver mate in a few moves.

**Is there a faster mate?**

- **Qb4#** is not possible, as the queen is on b7.
- **Qb3+** is the most forcing move.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
b7b3
```

2025-06-11 21:32:49,814 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.20s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Queen (b3), Rook (c1), Bishop (c1), pawns (b2, c2, g3, h3), King (g1)  
Black: King (d4), pawns (a7, g7, h7)

**Position:**  
- Black's king is exposed on d4, far from its pawns.
- White's queen is very active on b3, cutting off the Black king.
- White's rook and bishop are undeveloped but can quickly join the attack.
- Black's pawns are not dangerous yet.
- White's king is safe.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can deliver checks with the queen, possibly forcing the Black king further into the open.
- White can also bring the rook or bishop into play, but the queen is best placed to start an attack.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **b3b4+** (Queen check): Forces the Black king to c3 or e3.  
2. **b3d3+** (Queen check): Forces the Black king to e5 or c5.  
3. **b3d5+** (Queen check): Forces the Black king to e3 or c3.  
4. **b3c4** (Queen move): Not a check, but attacks the king and supports the bishop.  
5. **b3g8** (Queen move): Not a check, but threatens to invade.  
6. **c1e3+** (Bishop check): Forces the Black king to e3 or c4.

Let's analyze the checks:

**1. b3b4+**  
- If Kc3, then Qb3+ wins the king (since the king can't escape).
- If Ke3, then Qe1+ is possible, but the king can go to f3.

**2. b3d3+**  
- If Kc5, then Qb5# is checkmate.
- If Ke5, then Qe3+ picks up the king.

**3. b3d5+**  
- If Kc3, then Qb3+ is strong.
- If Ke3, then Qe1+.

**4. c1e3+**  
- If Kxe3, then Qd3# is checkmate.
- If Kc4, then Qd3# is checkmate.

**Wait! Let's check c1e3+:**
- If Kxe3, Qd3#.
- If Kc4, Qd3#.

So, **c1e3+** is a forced checkmate in one move, since both king moves are met by Qd3#.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c1e3
```

2025-06-11 21:32:58,868 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.94s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Queen (b3), Bishop (e3), Rook (b1), pawns (g3, h3, c2, b2), King (g1)  
Black: King (e5), pawn (a7), pawn (g7), pawn (h7)

**Position:**  
- Black's king is exposed on e5.  
- White's queen, bishop, and rook are very active and coordinate well.  
- Black's pawns are not dangerous; White is up massive material.  
- White's king is safe.

**Goal:**  
- Find the fastest way to checkmate or win more material, while avoiding stalemate or perpetual check.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **Qb5+**: Forces the king to f6 or e6.  
2. **Qe6+**: Forces the king to d4 or f6.  
3. **Bf4+**: Forces the king to d4 or e6.  
4. **Qb8**: Threatens mate on e5, but not immediate.  
5. **Qb7+**: King moves to f6 or e6.

Let's check **Qb5+**:

- 61. Qb5+ Kf6 (if Ke4, then Qd3#; if Kd6, Qc5#)
- 62. Qg5+ Kf7 (if Ke6, Bf4#)
- 63. Rb7+ Ke6
- 64. Qe7# (mate)

But let's check if there is a faster mate.

**Bf4+**:

- 61. Bf4+ Kd4 (if Kf6, Qg5#)
- 62. Qb4+ Kd5
- 63. Qd6+ Kc4
- 64. Qb4#

But Black can go to d5, so not immediate.

**Qb5+** seems to be the most forcing.

Let's check for stalemate traps: Black has pawns on a7, g7, h7, so no stalemate.

**Final check:**  
- 61. Qb5+ Kf6 (if Ke4, Qd3#; if Kd6, Qc5#)
- 62. Qg5+ Kf7
- 63. Rb7+ Ke6
- 64. Qe7#

So, **Qb5+** is the best move, leading to a forced mate in a few moves.

**Therefore, my move is:**
```
b3b5

2025-06-11 21:33:00,642 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 21:33:07,076 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.43s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (b5), Bishop (e3), Rook (b1), pawns (b2, c2, g3, h3, h4), King (g1)
- Black: King (d6), pawns (a7, g7, h7)

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on d6, with no pawn cover and no pieces nearby.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**  
- White threatens to invade with the queen and rook.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate Moves:**  
Let's look for forced mates or ways to win material.

1. **b5b7+**: Queen check on b7. Black king must move to e5 or c6.
   - 1...Ke5: Then Qe7# is mate.
   - 1...Kc6: Then Qb7+ Kd6, and we're back.

2. **b5e5+**: Queen check on e5. Black king must move to c6 or d7.
   - 1...Kc6: Qb5+ Kd6, back to the same.
   - 1...Kd7: Qxg7+ wins a pawn.

3. **b5d3+**: Queen check on d3. Black king must move to c6 or e5.
   - 1...Kc6: Qb5+ Kd6, repeats.
   - 1...Ke5: Qd4# is mate.

4. **b5d7**: Queen to d7, not a check.

5. **b5b8**: Queen to b8, not a check.

6. **e3f4+**: Bishop check on f4. Black king must move to c6 or e6.
   - 1...Kc6: Qb5+ Kd6, repeats.
   - 1...e6: Qb5+ Kd6, repeats.

**Critical Calculation:**

Let's check **b5b7+**:
- 1. Qb7+ Ke5 (forced)
- 2. Qe7# (mate)

So, **b5b7+** is a forced mate in 2.

**Final Move:**
```
b5b7
```

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

---

### **FEN Position:**
`8/pQ4pp/3k4/8/8/4B1PP/1PP5/1R4K1 b - - 10 62`

- Black to move.
- Material is roughly equal, but both sides have passed pawns and active pieces.
- White has a queen on b7, rook on b1, king on g1, and several pawns including a strong pawn chain on the queenside (b2, c2, b3).
- Black has a lone king on d6, with pawns on a7, g7, h7. All other material is gone.
- The position seems like a late endgame where both sides are pushing pawns, but Black must be careful not to lose.

---

### **Legal Moves for Black:**

```
d6e6
d6e5
h7h6
g7g6
a7a6
h7h5
g7g5
a7a5
```

We need to evaluate each of these moves in context of the position.

---

## **Evaluation of Candidate Moves**

### **1. `d6e6` — King to e6**
- Centralizes the king.
- Brings it closer to support the a-pawn or potentially intercept white’s pawns.
- Keeps king active and flexible.
- Seems very strong.

### **2. `d6e5` — King to e5**
- Also centralizing, but more advanced.
- Could allow king to attack pawns on f4/e4 if any existed, but none do.
- Might overextend king without clear purpose.
- Less safe than `e6`.

### **3. `h7h6` — Pawn to h6**
- Prevents potential back-rank issues.
- Does nothing useful otherwise.
- Passive.

### **4. `g7g6` — Pawn to g6**
- Similar to above; passive.
- Doesn't help king activity or counterplay.

### **5. `a7a6` — Pawn to a6**
- Slows down White’s queen/bishop from controlling the a-file.
- But allows White to play `Qb7-a7` and threaten pawn capture.
- Not ideal.

### **6. `h7h5` — Pawn to h5**
- Creates space on the kingside.
- Could be useful if there was a plan involving king walk to h6 or g5, but no pawns to promote here.
- Risky and slow.

### **7. `g7g5` — Pawn to g5**
- Same as above.
- Weakens king position slightly.
- No real benefit.

### **8. `a7a5` — Pawn to a5**
- Pushes the pawn forward.
- May give White an easy target.
- Too slow.

---

## **Best Move Analysis**

The key is **king activity**. Black needs to keep the king centralized and ready to respond to threats on either wing. The best square for that is **e6**, which gives maximum flexibility:

- Can go to d5, e5, f5, f6, etc.
- Helps control critical squares around the center.
- Supports potential counterplay with the a-pawn if White gets too greedy.

Also, note that White has a queen on b7 and a rook on b1. If Black plays passively, White may push c4-c5+ and force a win.

So we must **stay active**.

---

## ✅ Final Move:
```
d6e6

2025-06-11 21:33:33,642 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.81s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (b7), Bishop (e3), Rook (b1), pawns on b2, c2, g3, h3, King (g1)
- Black: King (e6), pawns on a7, h7, g7

**King safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on e6.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**  
- White is threatening to invade with the queen and rook.
- Black has no real counterplay.

**Immediate tactical possibilities:**  
- Look for forced mates or ways to win more material.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **Qb7-b3+**: Check, forces the king to f5 or e5.
2. **Qb7-e4+**: Check, king must move.
3. **Qb7-f7+**: Check, king must move.
4. **Qb7-g7**: Captures pawn, but not forcing.
5. **Qb7xg7**: Captures pawn, but not forcing.
6. **Qb7-d5+**: Check, king must move.

Let's check the most forcing checks:

### 1. Qb7-b3+
- King can only go to f5 (e5 is covered by bishop).
- After Kf5, White can play Qf7+ (double check with bishop), forcing Kg5, then h4# is mate.

But let's check the lines:

#### Qb7-b3+ Ke5
- Ke5 is not possible (bishop covers e5).

#### Qb7-b3+ Kf5
- Qf7+ (double check), Kg5, h4# is mate.

### 2. Qb7-e4+
- Ke5 is not possible (bishop covers).
- Kf6 is not possible (queen covers).
- Kd6 is not possible (queen covers).
- So only move is Kf6, but that's not possible.

### 3. Qb7-f7+
- King can only go to e5 or d6.
- e5 is covered by bishop.
- d6 is covered by queen.

So, Qb7-b3+ is the most forcing, and leads to a forced mate:

1. Qb7-b3+ Kf5
2. Qf7+ Kg5
3. h4#

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b7b3

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

---

### **FEN Position:**
`8/p5pp/4k3/8/8/1Q2B1PP/1PP5/1R4K1 b - - 12 63`

- Black to move.
- Material is roughly equal, but both sides have passed pawns advancing toward promotion.
- White has a queen on b3, rook on b1, king on g1, and several pawns.
- Black’s king is in the center (e6), and the only active piece is the bishop on e6. The rest of Black’s pieces are off the board or captured.
- Black has a pawn on a7, two pawns on g7 and h7, and the bishop on e6.
- Both sides have advanced pawns dangerously:
  - White: c2, b2, and a2 are all moving up.
  - Black: a7 is still on the second rank, but not yet moving.

---

### **Legal Moves for Black (from engine):**
- `e6e7`
- `e6d7`
- `e6f6`
- `e6d6`
- `e6f5`
- `e6e5`

We must evaluate each of these moves with precision.

---

## 🧠 Candidate Move Analysis:

### **1. e6-e7**
- Bishop leaves the defense of the e6 square.
- This allows White to play Qb3-b5+ (forking king and bishop).
- After e6-e7, Qb5+ forces Ke6-d7, and White gains tempo and initiative.
- Not ideal — exposes the king and loses control over key diagonals.

### **2. e6-d7**
- Keeps the bishop defending the e6 square.
- Maintains pressure along the long diagonal.
- King remains centralized.
- Solid, but passive.

### **3. e6-f5**
- Active bishop move.
- Eyes the white king-side.
- Also threatens to go to g4 or h3, pressuring g2/h3.
- Could support counterplay against the white king if White advances too aggressively.
- Seems promising.

### **4. e6-d6**
- Retreats the bishop closer to the king.
- Might help in setting up a fortress or defensive structure.
- But gives away space and initiative.
- Too passive.

### **5. e6-f6**
- Similar to f5.
- Slightly less aggressive than f5.
- Still controls important squares around the king.
- Good alternative.

### **6. e6-e5**
- Controls d4 and f4.
- Restricts White’s queen from entering via b5 or d5.
- Very solid.
- May be useful if preparing to bring king into the game.

---

## 🔍 Strategic Considerations:

- White has a queen and rook aiming at the queenside where their pawns are advancing.
- Black needs to either:
  - Counterattack on the kingside.
  - Or prevent White’s queen from infiltrating.
- Best chance is to activate the bishop and possibly threaten checks on the king-side.
- Avoid allowing White to promote without counterplay.

---

## ✅ Final Evaluation:

The best move is one that:
- Keeps the bishop active.
- Prevents immediate threats like Qb5+.
- Opens lines for potential counterplay.

### 👑 Best Move: **e6-f5**

This move:
- Develops the bishop actively.
- Threatens to go to g4 or h3, pressuring the white king-side.
- Denies the queen access to the b1-h7 diagonal.
- Offers the most dynamic chances for Black.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (b3), Bishop (e3), Rook (b1), 2 pawns (c2, h3), King (g1), 2 pawns (g3, h3)
- Black: King (f5), 1 pawn (a7), 1 pawn (g7), 1 pawn (h7)

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on f5.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**  
- White has a huge material advantage and Black has no immediate threats.
- White can try to checkmate the Black king or win more material.

**Candidate Moves:**  
- Immediate checks: Qf7+, Qd3+, Qb5+, Qb4+, Qf3+ (none are available from b3)
- Bishop moves: Be3-d4+ is possible and forces the king to move.
- Queen moves: Qf7+ is not possible, but Qd3+ is possible via Qb3-d3+.
- Rook moves: Rb4+ is possible.

2025-06-11 21:34:22,563 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.23s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (d3), Rook (b1), Bishop (e3), 3 pawns (b2, c2, g3), King (g1), h3 pawn, g3 pawn
- Black: King (e6), Pawn (a7), Pawn (g7), Pawn (h7)

**Position:**  
- Black's king is on e6, somewhat exposed.
- White's queen, rook, and bishop are very active and coordinate well.
- Black has no immediate threats; White is completely winning.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **d3d8** (Queen to d8): This is a check. Black's king can only go to f5 or f7. After Kf5, White can play Rf1# (mate). After Kf7, White can play Rf1+ and then Qf8#.
2. **d3d7** (Queen to d7): This is a check. King can go to f6 or e5. Not as forcing as d8.
3. **d3e4** (Queen to e4): Check, but Black can block with Kf6 or Kd6.
4. **d3d6** (Queen to d6): Check, but Black can play Kf5.
5. **d3f5** (Queen to f5): Check, but Black can play Kd6.

**Best move:**  
- **d3d8** is the most forcing. Let's check the lines:

1. **d3d8+**
   - **Ke5**: Not possible, as e5 is covered by the queen.
   - **Kf5**: Only move.
     - Now, **Rf1#** is checkmate (rook covers f1-f8, queen covers d8-f6, bishop covers e3-f4, king is boxed in).
   - **Kf7**: Only other move.
     - Now, **Rf1+** and after Kg6, **Qf8#** is mate.

So, **d3d8** is a forced mate in 2.

**Final move:**
```
d3d8
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (d8), Bishop (e3), Rook (b1), pawns on b2, c2, g3, h3, King (g1)  
- Black: King (f5), pawns on a7, g7, h7

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on f5.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**  
- White is up massive material and Black has no immediate threats.
- White can look for forced mates or win more material.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qd8-g5#**: This is checkmate, as the Black king on f5 has no escape squares and cannot block or capture the queen.
2. Other checks: Qd8-d5+, Qd8-f8+, but these are not as forcing as Qg5#.

**Double-checking Qg5#:**
- The Black king on f5 is surrounded:
  - e6: occupied by White bishop
  - f6: occupied by White queen after Qg5
  - g6: occupied by White pawn
  - g5: occupied by White queen after Qg5
  - g4: occupied by White pawn
  - f4: occupied by White pawn
  - e5: occupied by White bishop
  - e4: not accessible
- No Black piece can block or capture on g5.

**Conclusion:**  
Qg5 is checkmate.

**Final move:**
```
d8g5

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: Rook (b1), Bishop (e3), Queen (g5), pawns on b2, c2, g3, h3, King (g1)  
Black: King (e4), pawns on a7, h7, g7

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on e4.
- White's queen, bishop, and rook are active and coordinate well.
- Black has no immediate threats; White is completely winning.

**Immediate Tactics:**  
- White's queen on g5 is very close to Black's king.
- White can check with Qg4+, Qf4+, Qe4+, Qh4+, but let's check which are legal and best.
- White's bishop on e3 controls c5, d4, f4, g5.
- White's rook on b1 can swing to b4 or b7 if needed.

**Candidate Moves:**  
- Qg4+ (forces the king to f3 or d5)
- Qf4+ (forces the king to d5 or f3)
- Qe4+ (forces the king to f3 or d5)
- Qh4+ (forces the king to f3 or d5)
- Qg6+ (forces the king to f3 or d5)
- Qf5+ (forces the king to d4 or e3)
- Qh5+ (forces the king to d4 or e3)
- Qe5+ (forces the king to d3 or f3)
- Qd5+ (forces the king to f3 or d3)
- Qc5+ (forces the king to f3 or d3)
- Qb5+ (forces the king to f3 or d3)
- Qa5+ (forces the king to f3 or d3)
- Qg4+ is the most forcing, as it checks the king and keeps the initiative.

**Let's check Qg4+:**
- 1. Qg4+ Ke3 (only move)
- 2. Rb3#

That's mate in two.

**Final move:**
```
g5g4

2025-06-11 21:34:45,472 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.85s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (g4), Bishop (e3), Rook (b1), pawns (b2, c2, g3, h3), King (g1)
- Black: King (d5), pawns (a7, g7, h7)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is exposed on d5.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Threats:**
- White is threatening to checkmate Black's king with the queen and bishop.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate Moves:**
- All queen checks: g4d4+, g4f3+, g4e6+, g4g5+, g4h5+, g4d7+, g4g7+, g4c8+
- Bishop moves: e3xa7, e3h6, e3b6, e3g5, e3c5, e3f4, e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, e3c1
- Rook moves: b1f1, b1e1, b1d1, b1c1, b1a1
- King moves: g1h2, g1g2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1
- Pawn moves: h3h4, c2c3, b2b3, c2c4, b2b4

**Tactical Analysis:**
- The Black king is on d5, with no immediate pawn cover.
- The queen on g4 can check on d4, which is covered by the bishop on e3.
- After Qd4+, Black's only legal move is to play Kc6 (since c5, c4, e5, e4, e6, e7, d6, d7 are all covered or occupied).
- After Kc6, White can play Qc8+ (forcing Kd6), then Bf4# is mate.

Let's check this line:
1. Qd4+ Kc6 (forced)
2. Qc8+ Kd6 (forced)
3. Bf4# (checkmate)

**Is there any defense for Black?**
- After Qd4+, Kc6 is forced.
- After Qc8+, Kd6 is forced.
- After Bf4#, the king is mated.

**Conclusion:**
The move Qd4+ leads to forced mate in 3.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 21:34:54,698 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.57s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (d4), Bishop (e3), Rook (b1), pawns (b2, c2, g3, h3), King (g1)
- Black: King (c6), pawns (a7, g7, h7)

**King safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on c6, with no pawn cover and no pieces to defend.
- White's king is very safe on g1.

**Threats:**  
- White threatens to invade with queen and rook, and Black has no counterplay.
- Black's only hope is to push a-pawn, but it's too slow.

**Immediate tactics:**  
- White can check with the queen: d4-d8+, d4-g7+, d4-d7+, d4-a7+.
- Rook can swing to b7 or b8 after the queen moves.
- Bishop controls a7 and f4 squares, so Black's king is very limited.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4-d8+**: Queen check. Black must play Kc7 or Kb7.
   - If Kb7, then Qd7+ wins the a7 pawn and threatens mate.
   - If Kc7, then Qd7+ forces Kb8, and then Bf4+ wins the king.
2. **d4-g7+**: Queen check. Black must play Kd6 or Kd7.
   - If Kd6, then Bf4+ is mate.
   - If Kd7, then Qxg7+ wins.
3. **d4-d7+**: Queen check. Black must play Kc5 or Kb6.
   - If Kc5, then Qd5+ wins.
   - If Kb6, then Qb5+ wins.
4. **d4-a7**: Queen check. Black must play Kd6 or Kb6.
   - If Kd6, then Bf4+ is mate.
   - If Kb6, then Qb6+ wins.

**Best move calculation:**

Let's check **d4-g7+**:

1. Qg7+ Kd6 (forced)
2. Bf4# (Checkmate)

So, **Qg7+** is mate in 2.

Let's check **d4-d8+**:

1. Qd8+ Kc7 (forced)
2. Qd7+ Kb8
3. Bf4+ Ka8
4. Qc6#

But that's mate in 4, so **Qg7+** is faster.

**Final move:**
```
d4g7

2025-06-11 21:35:02,155 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.73s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Queen (g7), Bishop (e3), Rook (b1), pawns (b2, c2, g3, h3), King (g1)  
- Black: King (b5), pawn (a7), pawn (h7)

**King Safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on b5, with no pawn cover and limited escape squares.
- White's queen is very active on g7, controlling the 7th rank and threatening checks.
- White's bishop on e3 covers important diagonals.
- White's rook on b1 is ready to swing to the b-file or elsewhere.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Immediate Threats:**  
- White can check with Qb7+ or Qe5+.
- Black's only real hope is to push the a-pawn, but it's not immediately threatening.

**Candidate Moves:**  
1. Qb7+ — This forces the Black king to a4 (the only legal move).
2. Qe5+ — This forces the Black king to a6 (the only legal move).
3. Rb3+ — This forces the Black king to c4 or a4.
4. Bxa7 — Captures the pawn, but doesn't threaten mate immediately.
5. g4 — Not urgent, as White should press for mate.

Let's check Qb7+:

- 70. Qb7+ Ka4 (only move)
- 71. Qb3+ Ka5 (only move)
- 72. Bd2+ Ka6 (only move)
- 73. Qb7# (checkmate)

Alternatively, after Qb7+ Ka4, Rb3 is also mate in a few.

**Conclusion:**  
The move Qb7+ is the fastest route to mate. It forces the king to a4, and then White can continue with Qb3+ and Bd2+, leading to mate.

**Final move:**
```
g7b7

2025-06-11 21:35:08,219 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.73s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Queen (b7), Bishop (e3), Rook (b1), pawns on b2, c2, g3, h3, King (g1)
- Black: King (a4), pawn (h7), no other pieces

**White to move.**

**Black's king is on a4, very exposed. White's queen is on b7, controlling the b-file and a7. The bishop on e3 covers a7 and c5. The rook on b1 controls the b-file. White's king is safe. Black's only pawn is on h7, far from queening.**

**Immediate threats:**
- White can try to checkmate the black king, which is nearly boxed in.
- The black king has only a5 and a3 as possible escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qb5#**: Queen to b5 is checkmate. The king on a4 cannot move to a5 (covered by queen), cannot move to a3 (covered by queen), cannot move to b3 (covered by rook), cannot move to b4 (covered by queen), cannot move to b5 (covered by queen), cannot move to a5 (covered by queen). The bishop on e3 covers a7, so the king cannot escape.

**Double-check:**
- After Qb5, the king on a4 has no legal moves.
- No other black pieces can block or capture the queen.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is checkmate in one:

2025-06-11 21:35:19,107 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.40s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (e3), pawns on b2, c2, g3, h3, King (g1)
- Black: King (b5), pawn (a7), pawn (h7)

**Position:**  
- White is up a rook and bishop for two pawns.  
- Black's king is cut off on the queenside, and White's king is safe.  
- White's pawns are ready to advance, and Black has no real counterplay.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can push the queenside pawns or centralize the bishop and rook.
- The Black king is cut off from the center and queenside pawns.
- White can try to create a passed pawn or invade with the rook.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **c2c4+**: Immediate check, forcing the king to a4 or a6.
2. **b2b3**: Prepares c4+ and restricts the Black king.
3. **g3g4**: Starts pushing kingside pawns, but less urgent.
4. **e3d4**: Centralizes bishop, but not as forcing.
5. **b1b3+**: Rook check, but king can go to a4 or a6.
6. **e3a7**: Attacks a7 pawn, but not urgent.

**Analysis:**

- **c2c4+**: If ...Kxc4, then Bxa7 wins the pawn. If ...Ka4, then b3+ wins the king.
- **b1b3+**: If ...Ka4, then Bxa7 wins the pawn. If ...Kc6, then c4+ is strong.
- **e3a7**: Threatens to win the pawn, but Black can play a6.

But **c2c4+** is the most forcing, as it immediately checks the king and can win the a7 pawn or force the king further away.

**Let's calculate c2c4+:**
- 1. c2c4+ Kxc4 (if taken), 2. Bxa7 wins the pawn, and White is up a full rook and bishop.
- 1. c2c4+ Kb4, then b3+ wins the king.
- 1. c2c4+ Ka4, then b3+ Kb4, Bd2# is mate.

**Wait, let's check for mate:**
- 1. c2c4+ Ka4
- 2. b3+ Kb4
- 3. Bd2# is checkmate.

**Therefore, c2c4+ is a forced mate in 3!**

**Final move:**
```
c2c4

2025-06-11 21:35:29,975 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.94s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (e3), 2 pawns (b2, g3), King (g1), h3 pawn, g3 pawn  
- Black: King (c4), pawn (a7), pawn (h7)

**King safety:**  
- Black's king is exposed on c4.
- White's king is safe on g1.

**Passed pawns:**  
- Black: a7 and h7 are both far from queening.
- White: b2 is a potential passed pawn.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White threatens to invade with the rook and bishop.
- Black has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **e3a7**: Bishop takes pawn, wins a pawn, threatens to invade with rook.
2. **e3h6**: Bishop attacks h7, but not urgent.
3. **e3b6**: Bishop attacks rook, but no rook there.
4. **e3g5**: Bishop centralizes, but not urgent.
5. **e3c5**: Bishop attacks king, but king can move.
6. **e3f4**: Bishop attacks king, but not effective.
7. **e3d4**: Bishop attacks king, but king can move.
8. **e3f2**: Bishop retreats, not useful.
9. **e3d2**: Bishop retreats, not useful.
10. **e3c1**: Bishop retreats, not useful.
11. **g1h2/g2/f2/h1/f1**: King moves, not urgent.
12. **b1f1/e1/d1/c1/a1**: Rook moves, but not urgent.
13. **h3h4/g3g4**: Pawn moves, not urgent.
14. **b2b3/b4**: Pawn moves, but not urgent.

**Best move analysis:**

- **Bishop takes a7 (e3a7)**: This wins a pawn, threatens to support the b-pawn, and removes Black's only queenside pawn. After this, White can push b2-b3-b4 and create a passed pawn, supported by the bishop and rook. Black's king is cut off from the kingside and cannot stop the b-pawn. White's rook and bishop can coordinate to win easily.

- Other bishop moves do not win material or create immediate threats.

- Rook moves are not urgent; the rook is well placed to support pawn advances.

- King moves are not urgent.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to take the pawn on a7 with the bishop, winning material and clearing the way for the b-pawn.

My move is:
```
e3a7
```

2025-06-11 21:35:40,423 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.82s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (a7), 3 pawns (b2, g3, h3), King (g1)
- Black: King (d5), Pawn (h7)

**Position:**
- White is up a rook and bishop for a pawn. Black's king is centralized but has no immediate threats.
- White's bishop on a7 is cutting off the Black king from the queenside.
- White's rook on b1 is ready to swing to the 7th or 8th rank.
- White's king is safe on g1.
- Black's only pawn is on h7, which is not immediately dangerous.

**Goals:**
- Convert the material advantage to a win.
- Avoid stalemate tricks.
- Coordinate rook and bishop to restrict the Black king and push pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a7b8: Bishop retreat, not threatening.
2. a7b6: Bishop attacks d4, but not forcing.
3. a7c5: Bishop check, but Black king can go to e4 or c4.
4. a7d4: Bishop attacks, but not forcing.
5. a7e3: Bishop attacks, not forcing.
6. a7f2: Bishop attacks, not forcing.
7. g1h2/g1g2/g1f2/g1h1/g1f1: King moves, not urgent.
8. b1f1/b1e1/b1d1/b1c1/b1a1: Rook moves, but not urgent.
9. h3h4/g3g4: Pawn moves, but not urgent.
10. b2b3/b2b4: Pawn moves, but not urgent.

**Best move analysis:**
- The move **a7c5+** gives check and forces the Black king to move. Let's see where the king can go:
    - d5-c4: King moves toward queenside, but White can then play b2-b3, further restricting.
    - d5-e4: King moves toward center, but White can then play rook to e1 or e1-b4, cutting off.
- After a7c5+, the Black king is forced to move, and White can then use the rook to cut off the king and start pushing pawns.

**Other moves** do not force the Black king to move and give Black more freedom.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to check with the bishop and restrict the Black king.

2025-06-11 21:35:50,199 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.39s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
White: King (g1), Rook (b1), Bishop (c5), Pawns (b2, g3, h3, h4)  
Black: King (e6), Pawn (h7)  

White is up a rook and bishop for a pawn, and Black's king is exposed. The only real counterplay for Black is the h-pawn, but it's not advanced yet. White's pieces are active and coordinated.

**Candidate moves:**
- c5f8: Bishop attacks the rook square, but there's no rook on f8.
- c5e7: Bishop attacks, but not check.
- c5a7: Bishop attacks, but not check.
- c5d6: Bishop check! King must move.
- c5b6: Bishop attacks, but not check.
- c5d4: Bishop attacks, but not check.
- c5b4: Bishop attacks, but not check.
- c5e3: Bishop attacks, but not check.
- c5a3: Bishop attacks, but not check.
- c5f2: Bishop attacks, but not check.

Other moves are king moves, rook moves, or pawn moves, none of which are checks or forceful.

**Tactical considerations:**
- c5d6+ is a check. Black king must move.
  - If Kxd6, then Rxb6 wins another pawn.
  - If Kf5, then Rf1+ is coming, or g4+.
- The bishop on c5 is well-placed, and d6+ is a forcing move.

**Strategic considerations:**
- White should press the material advantage and avoid stalemate tricks.
- White should keep the Black king cut off and mop up the h-pawn if possible.

**Best move:**
- c5d6+ is the most forcing, and it drives the king away from the center, making it easier to convert.

**Final move:**
```
c5d6
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k1p/3B4/8/8/6PP/1P6/1R4K1 w - - 5 76

- White: King on g1, rook on b1, bishop on d6, pawns on b2, g3, h3, h2
- Black: King on f7, pawn on h7

Material: White is up a bishop and a pawn. Black has only a king and a pawn on h7.

**Immediate threats and goals:**
- White's bishop and rook dominate the board.
- Black's king is cut off from the center and queenside.
- White's king is safe.
- The h7 pawn is not dangerous.
- White's plan: Activate the king, push pawns, and/or invade with the rook.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6f8** (Bishop to f8): Threatens to win the h7 pawn, but not immediately decisive.

**Key ideas:**
- The Black king is cut off from the queenside.
- White can invade with the rook via b7 or b8.
- White can play Rb7+, forcing the king to move, then pick up the h7 pawn with the bishop.
- White can also activate the king, but the rook and bishop are already dominating.

**Best move analysis:**
- **Rb7+** is not available, but **Rb8** is possible after moving the bishop.
- **Bishop to f8** threatens to win the h7 pawn, but Black can play Kg8, defending the pawn.
- **Bishop to e7** attacks the king, but after Ke6, the king is more active.
- **King activation** is slow.
- **Rook to f1** prepares Rf1-f4, attacking h7.

But the most direct plan is to play **Bishop to f8**, threatening to win the h7 pawn. After **Bf8 Kg8**, White can play **Rb8** and then **Bh6**, winning the pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d6f8
```

2025-06-11 21:36:13,424 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.77s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: Rook (b1), King (g1), pawns on b2, g3, h3  
- Black: Bishop (f8), King (g8), pawn (h7)

**White to move.**

**Key points:**
- White is up a rook for a bishop and pawn.
- Black's king is on g8, bishop on f8, pawn on h7.
- White's king is on g1, rook on b1, pawns on b2, g3, h3.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black has no immediate threats. The bishop is passive.
- White can try to activate the rook, advance pawns, or bring the king closer.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b2-b4**: Start pushing the queenside pawn majority. The rook on b1 supports this.
2. **g3-g4**: Start pushing kingside pawns, but Black's bishop can control light squares.
3. **h3-h4**: Similar to g4, but less effective.
4. **King moves (g1-f2, g1-h2, etc.)**: Start centralizing the king.
5. **Rook moves (b1-f1, etc.)**: Try to invade via the f-file or swing to the 7th/8th rank.

**Deeper analysis:**
- The most direct plan is to push the b-pawn. Black's bishop is far from the queenside and can't stop the pawn easily.
- After b4, if Black tries to activate the bishop (e.g., Bc5+), White can block with Kg2 or Kh2, and the rook can support the pawn advance.
- The king can also start moving toward the center, but pawn play is more urgent.

**Is there any tactical shot?**
- No immediate tactics, but b4 is the most active and direct plan.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to start pushing the b-pawn, supported by the rook, to create a passed pawn and distract Black's bishop and king.

**Final move:**
```
b2b4

2025-06-11 21:36:37,499 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 22.92s):
Let's analyze the position carefully.

---

### **Current Position (FEN):**
```
5Bk1/7p/8/8/1P6/6PP/8/1R4K1 b - - 0 77
```

You are playing as **Black**. The legal moves are:

- `g8h8` – King to h8  
- `g8f8` – King to f8  
- `g8f7` – King captures on f7  
- `h7h6` – Pawn advances  
- `h7h5` – Pawn advances

---

### **Material:**

- **White:** Bishop on f8, Rook on b1, King on g1, pawns on b4, g3, h3  
- **Black:** King on g8, pawn on h7  

So White has a material advantage of bishop + rook + 3 pawns vs. just a king and one pawn for Black.

But the position is very drawish unless White can make progress with the pawns or coordinate the rook and bishop effectively.

---

### **Key Observations:**

- Black’s only real threat is the h7 pawn, which could potentially promote if not blocked.
- White’s bishop is currently blocking the h-pawn from advancing.
- If Black plays `...h5`, then `h3-h4` might open up a path for the h-pawn to advance.
- The white rook is passive on b1; it needs to get active.
- The black king is in the corner — but there's no immediate mating net possible.

---

### **Candidate Moves:**

#### 1. `g8f7` – King takes bishop
This removes the only piece that can stop the h-pawn from promoting. After this move:
- Material becomes equal (king + pawn vs. king + rook)
- Black has a chance to push the h-pawn and promote it.

Let’s see what happens after `g8f7`.

Then White's best reply would be `b1b7` threatening mate on g7 or pushing the b-pawn.

But Black can respond with `h7h5` followed by `h5h4`, trying to break through.

Still, with correct play, Black may be able to promote the h-pawn first.

#### 2. `h7h6` – Holding off pawn advancement
This keeps tension and prevents White from immediately advancing h4.

However, White can still try to activate the rook with `b1b3` or `b1b7`.

#### 3. `h7h5` – Pushing the pawn
This opens up possibilities for a race. But White can answer with `h3h4`, giving space for their own pawn.

#### 4. `g8h8` / `g8f8` – King maneuver
These don't achieve much unless preparing to support the h-pawn. But without capturing the bishop, the h-pawn is stuck.

---

### **Best Move Evaluation:**

The most promising move for Black is **capturing the bishop** with `g8f7`. This eliminates the only piece blocking the h-pawn and gives Black realistic chances to promote first.

After `g8f7`, the game becomes a race between Black's h-pawn and White's b-pawn or rook activity.

If Black follows up correctly with `h7h5`, `h5h4`, and careful king support, they can force a win.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

```

2025-06-11 21:36:45,906 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.05s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (f8), 4 pawns (b4, h3, g3, h6), King (g1)
- Black: King (f7), pawn (h7)

**Position:**
- White's rook is active on b1, bishop is powerfully placed on f8, controlling key diagonals and cutting off the black king.
- Black's king is on f7, somewhat boxed in by White's bishop and pawns.
- Black's only pawn is on h7, which is not dangerous at the moment.
- White's king is safe on g1.
- White's pawns on b4, g3, h3, h6 are all safe and can be used to restrict Black further.

**Immediate threats and candidate moves:**
- White is completely winning, but must avoid stalemate tricks.
- The Black king is cut off from the 6th and 8th ranks by the bishop.
- The rook can swing to the 7th rank (b7) to cut off the king further.
- Advancing the b-pawn is also an option, but let's see if we can force mate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b4-b5**: Advance the pawn, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
2. **Rb1-b7**: Rook to the 7th, cutting off the king and threatening Rg7+.
3. **Bf8-h6**: Bishop to h6, but doesn't do much.
4. **g3-g4**: Advance the pawn, but not urgent.
5. **h3-h4**: Advance the pawn, not urgent.
6. **King moves**: Not needed right now.

**Analysis of Rb7:**
- After Rb7, Black has no checks, and the king is further restricted.
- If Black plays h7-h6, White can play Bxh6.
- If Black does nothing, White can bring the king up or push pawns.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- After Rb7, if Black plays h7-h6, Bxh6 wins the pawn.
- If Black does nothing, White can play b5, then b6, then b7, and promote.

**Any stalemate tricks?**
- Not at the moment, as Black still has the h7 pawn.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to play Rb7, cutting off the king and preparing to win the h7 pawn or advance the b-pawn.

My move is:
```
b1b7
```

2025-06-11 21:36:50,270 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.36s):
Thank you for pointing out the error and providing the legal moves. Let's re-examine the position and the available options:

**Legal moves:**  
f8g7, f8e7, f8h6, f8d6, f8c5, g1h2, g1g2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1, b1b3, b1b2, b1f1, b1e1, b1d1, b1c1, b1a1, b4b5, h3h4, g3g4

**Analysis:**

- The Black king is on f7, White bishop on f8, rook on b1, pawns on b4, h3, g3, h6, White king on g1.
- Black's only pawn is h7.
- White is completely winning, but must avoid stalemate and play accurately.

**Key ideas:**
- The bishop on f8 is already cutting off the king from the e7 and g7 squares.
- Advancing the b-pawn (b4-b5) is a logical way to make progress.
- Rook moves along the first rank don't seem to threaten anything immediate.
- King moves are slow, but could be useful in the long run.
- Advancing the kingside pawns (h3-h4 or g3-g4) doesn't seem urgent.

**Best move:**
- Advancing the b-pawn (b4-b5) is the most direct plan. It prepares to create a passed pawn, and there are no stalemate tricks since Black still has the h7 pawn.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b4b5
```

2025-06-11 21:36:59,701 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.65s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), King (g1), pawns on b5, h3, g3, h4
- Black: King (g8), pawn (h7)

**White to move.**

**Position:**
- Black's king is stuck on the back rank, only escape squares are f8, g8, h8.
- Black has a pawn on h7, but it's not threatening.
- White's rook is very active.
- White's king is safe.
- White has a passed pawn on b5, which is very close to queening.
- Black has no counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
1. b5-b6: Push the passed pawn, threatening b7-b8=Q.
2. Rb1-b4: Prepare to support the pawn, cut off the king.
3. Rb1-b3: Swing the rook to the third rank, possibly to attack h7 or support the b-pawn.
4. h3-h4: Not urgent, doesn't change the position.
5. g3-g4: Not urgent, doesn't change the position.
6. King moves: Not urgent.

**Analysis:**
- b6 is the most direct move. After b6, Black cannot stop b7-b8=Q. If Black tries to bring the king closer (but it's cut off), or pushes h7-h6, it doesn't help.
- Rb4 is also good, but less direct.
- Rb3 is also good, but less direct.

**Check for stalemate traps:**
- After b6, if Black does nothing, White will play b7 and b8=Q. Black's king still has squares.
- After b7, Black's king is still not stalemated.
- After b8=Q, Black still has the h7 pawn to move.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is the most direct: push the passed pawn.

**Final move:**
```
b5b6

2025-06-11 21:37:06,723 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.04s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (f8), Pawn (b6), Pawns (h3, g3, h4)
- Black: King (f7), Pawn (h7)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is on f7, somewhat exposed.
- White's king is on g1, very safe.

**Passed Pawn:**
- White has a protected passed pawn on b6, which is one square from queening.
- Black's only pawn is on h7, far from queening and easily blockaded.

**Immediate Threats:**
- White can play b7, threatening to promote.
- Black cannot stop the b-pawn from queening without sacrificing the king or rook.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. b7: Push the pawn, threatening b8=Q next move.
2. Rook moves: Rook can move to b5, b4, b3, b2, but none of these threaten anything immediate.
3. Bishop moves: Bishop can move, but f8 is already a strong square.
4. King moves: Not urgent, as White's king is safe.

**Analysis:**
- After 1. b7, Black cannot stop b8=Q except by giving up the king, which is not possible.
- After 1...Kxf8, 2. b7-b8=Q is unstoppable.
- Black's only pawn is too far away to be relevant.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to push the pawn to b7, preparing to queen next move.

**Final move:**
```
b6b7

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5Bk1/1P5p/8/8/8/6PP/8/1R4K1 w - - 1 81

- White: King on g1, rook on b1, pawn on b7, pawns on h3, g3, h4
- Black: King on f8, bishop on f8, pawn on h7

**Material:** White is up a rook and a pawn for a bishop. The b7 pawn is one step from queening. Black's king is boxed in, and the bishop is passive.

**Immediate threats:** 
- White can promote the b7 pawn with b7-b8=Q, but must check for stalemate or perpetual possibilities.
- Black's king is on f8, bishop on f8, pawn on h7. If the bishop moves, b8=Q+ is mate in some lines.

**Candidate moves:**
1. b7-b8=Q: Promote immediately. Is it safe? After b8=Q, Black has no checks, and White threatens mate soon.
2. Rb8: Prepare to promote, but unnecessary since b8=Q is available.
3. h3-h4, g3-g4: Slow, not urgent.
4. King moves: Not urgent.

**Check for stalemate after b8=Q:**
- Black's king is on f8, bishop on f8, pawn on h7. After b8=Q, Black can move the bishop or the pawn.
- Black's only legal moves are Bx (bishop moves) or h7-h6/h5.

**Is there any stalemate?**
- No, Black has pawn moves and bishop moves. No stalemate.

**Is there any perpetual or fortress?**
- No, White will have two queens or queen and rook, and Black has only a bishop and a pawn.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- After b8=Q, White can coordinate queen and rook for mate in a few moves.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

**Final move:**
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (White to move):**
- White: Queen on b8, Bishop on f8, King on g1, Rook on b1, pawns on h3, g3, h4
- Black: King on f7, pawn on h7

**Material:** White is up a queen, rook, bishop, and pawns vs just a king and pawn. Black has no counterplay.

**Immediate threats:** White can checkmate in one move if possible.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe8#**: Queen to e8 is checkmate (supported by the bishop on f8, king can't escape).
2. **Qb7+**: Queen check, but king can go to g8.
3. **Qb3+**: Queen check, but king can go to g8.
4. **Rb7+**: Rook check, but king can go to g8.

**Checkmate in one:**
- **Qe8#** is checkmate. The Black king on f7 cannot move to any square, and no piece can block or capture the queen.

**Final move:**
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4QBk1/7p/8/8/8/6PP/8/1R4K1 w - - 3 83

- White: King on g1, Queen on e8, Rook on b1, pawns on h3, g3
- Black: King on f8, Bishop on f8, pawn on h7

**Material:** White is up a queen and a rook for a bishop and pawn. Black's king is exposed, and White's queen is very active.

**Immediate threats:** White can checkmate Black with the right sequence. Let's look for forced mates.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxf8#**: Queen takes bishop on f8, checkmate. The Black king on f8 is boxed in by its own pawn on h7, the White queen, and the White rook on b1. There are no escape squares.

**Double-check:**
- After Qxf8#, Black's king cannot move to e7, g7, e8, or g8 (all covered by the queen or rook).
- No Black piece can capture the queen or block the check.

**Conclusion:** Qxf8# is checkmate.

**Final move:**
```

Thank you for your patience. Let's carefully analyze the position again.

**FEN:** 4QBk1/7p/8/8/8/6PP/8/1R4K1 w - - 3 83

**White:** Kg1, Qe8, Rb1, pawns h3, g3  
**Black:** Kf8, Bf8, ph7

**Legal moves (as provided):**  
f8g7, f8e7, f8h6, f8d6, f8c5, f8b4, f8a3, e8d8, e8c8, e8b8, e8a8, e8f7, e8e7, e8d7, e8g6, e8e6, e8c6, e8h5, e8e5, e8b5, e8e4, e8a4, e8e3, e8e2, e8e1, g1h2, g1g2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1, b1b8, b1b7, b1b6, b1b5, b1b4, b1b3, b1b2, b1f1, b1e1, b1d1, b1c1, b1a1, h3h4, g3g4

**Analysis:**

- The Black king is on f8, bishop on f8, pawn on h7.
- White's queen is on e8, rook on b1.
- There is no immediate checkmate in one, as Qxf8 is not legal (the bishop is blocking).
- Let's look for the most forcing move.

**Candidate moves:**
- **Qxf8 is not legal.**
- **Qe8-f7**: This is check, as the queen moves to f7 and attacks the king on f8. The only way to block would be with the bishop, but then Qxf8# would be mate.
- **Qe8-e7**: This is check, but the king can move to g8.
- **Qe8-d8**: This is check, but the king can move to g8.
- **Qe8-b8**: This is check, but the king can move to g8.
- **Qe8-e6**: This is check, but the king can move to g8.

Let's check **Qe8-f7**:

1. Qf7+ Bxf7 (forced)
2. Rb8# (rook moves to b8, checkmate, as the bishop is pinned and cannot block, and the king is trapped)

So, **Qf7+** is a forced mate in two.

**Final move:**
```
e8f7

Let's analyze the current position:

### FEN:
`5Bk1/5Q1p/8/8/8/6PP/8/1R4K1 b - - 4 83`

### Board Position:
```
. . . . . B k .
. . . . . Q . p
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . P P
. . . . . . . .
. R . . . . K .
```

You are playing **Black**, and the only legal moves are:
- `g8h8` (King to h8)
- `g8f7` (King captures on f7)

---

## Evaluation:

White has a queen (`Qf7`) and bishop (`Bf8`) bearing down on Black’s king, which is currently on g8.

The key point here is that **White's Queen is undefended** on f7.

If you play:
- `g8f7` → Black King captures White Queen — this is **free material**: Queen for King.

That would be ideal **if** no counterattack exists.

But we must be absolutely certain there are **no hidden threats or checks** after this move.

### After `g8f7`:

Board becomes:
```
. . . . . B k .
. . . . . . . p
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . P P
. . . . . . . .
. R . . . . K .
```

White now has:
- Light-squared bishop on f8 (attacking along the a3–f8 diagonal, but not dangerous right now)
- A rook on b1
- A pawn structure with pawns on g3 and h3

There is **no immediate threat** to Black's king after capturing the queen.

White cannot deliver check.
No discovered attacks.
Queen is simply hanging.

So, capturing the queen is safe and correct.

---

## Conclusion:

- The best move is **`g8f7`** — Black captures the undefended queen.
- This gives Black a decisive material advantage (up a queen).
- There is no counterplay or danger in doing so.

2025-06-11 21:37:59,450 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 10.11s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5B2/5k1p/8/8/8/6PP/8/1R4K1 w - - 0 84

**White:** King on g1, rook on b1, bishop on f8, pawns on h3, g3  
**Black:** King on f7, pawn on h7

**Material:** White is up a rook and bishop for a pawn.  
**Black's only pawn is on h7, which is blockaded.**  
**White's king is safe, and Black's king is cut off from the center.**

**White's plan:**  
- Use the rook and bishop to restrict the Black king.
- Bring the king up to help.
- Avoid stalemate tricks.
- Convert to a win, ideally by pushing the Black king to the edge and mating with rook and bishop.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rb8: Cuts off the Black king further, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
- Rf1+: Checks the king, but the king can go to g8 or e8.
- Bc5: Bishop can help cut off the king.
- h4: Start pushing the h-pawn, but not urgent.
- g4: Same as above.
- Kg2: Start bringing the king up.

But let's look for the most precise way to win. The Black king is on f7, so let's see if we can cut it off further.

**Move 1: Rf1+**
- If K moves to g8, then Bh6 is mate in 1.
- If K moves to e8, then Bh6 is mate in 1.

But let's check:  
- 1. Rf1+ Ke8 2. Bh6 (mate)  
- 1. Rf1+ Kg8 2. Bh6 (mate)

Wait, but the king is on f7, so after Rf1+, the only legal moves are Ke8 and Kg8.

**Let's check:**
- 1. Rf1+ Ke8 2. Bh6 (no, not mate, king can go to d7)
- 1. Rf1+ Kg8 2. Bh6 (no, king can't go to h8, but can go to h7)

But actually, after Rf1+, the king has only two squares: Ke8 and Kg8.

Let's check the lines:

1. Rf1+ Ke8
   - 2. Bh6 (threatens mate on f8, but not immediate)
   - Black can play Kd7, but then Rf7+ wins the king.

But let's check for stalemate tricks. If we play Rf1+, and the king goes to g8, then Bh6 is mate, because the king can't go to h8 or f7.

So let's check:

1. Rf1+ Kg8
   - 2. Bh6 (mate, because the king is on g8, and h7 is blocked by its own pawn, f8 is covered by the bishop, h8 is covered by the bishop, f7 is covered by the rook)

So, **Rf1+ is mate in 2 if Black plays Kg8**.

If 1... Ke8, then 2. Bh6, and the king can go to d7, but then Rf7+ wins the king.

But let's check if there is a forced mate.

Alternatively, is there a direct mate? Let's check Rb7+.

No, the king is not on the 7th rank.

So, the best move is:

```
Rf1+
```

2025-06-11 21:38:10,901 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.36s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5Bk1/7p/8/8/8/6PP/8/5RK1 w - - 2 85

- White: King on g1, Rook on f1, pawns on h3, g3
- Black: King on f8, pawn on h7

**Material:** White is up a rook for a pawn. Black's king is boxed in on the back rank, and White's king is safe. The only Black pawn is on h7, which is blockaded and not dangerous.

**White's plan:** 
- Use the rook and king to force Black's king to the edge and deliver mate.
- Avoid stalemate.
- Avoid allowing Black to trade the rook for the pawn (which is not possible here).
- Avoid perpetual checks (not possible here).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rf8+** (not possible, rook is on f1)
2. **Rf7**: Invades the 7th rank, cuts off the king, threatens Rg7# if the king moves.
3. **Rf6**: Prepares to bring the king up, but less forcing.
4. **Rf5, Rf4, etc.**: Not as forcing.
5. **h4**: Pushes the pawn, but not urgent.
6. **g4**: Same as above.
7. **Kg2, Kh2, etc.**: King activation, but rook activity is more important.

**Best move:**
- **Rf7** is the most forcing. It cuts off the king from the 7th rank, and threatens to swing to g7 for mate if the king moves. Black has no checks, and the king is stuck.

Let's check if there are any stalemate tricks:
- After Rf7, Black can only move the king (to e8, g8, or h8) or move the pawn (h7-h6).
- If h7-h6, White can play Rf6, then bring the king up, or play g4 and h4 to create a mating net.
- If the king moves, White can play Rg7# (if king goes to g8 or h8).

**Conclusion:** The best move is:
```
f1f7
```

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

---

### **FEN Position:**
```
5Bk1/5R1p/8/8/8/6PP/8/6K1 b - - 3 85
```

Black to move. The board looks like this:

- Black King is on g8.
- White King is on g1.
- White Rook is on f7.
- White Bishop is on f8.
- White pawns are on g3 and h3.
- Black pawn is on h7.

---

### **Legal Moves for Black (UCI):**

- `g8h8` – Move king to h8
- `g8f7` – Capture rook with king
- `h7h6` – Push h-pawn
- `h7h5` – Push h-pawn two squares

---

## 🧠 Evaluation of the Position

This is a late endgame, and material is very reduced. It seems both sides have traded almost everything except:

- White has a **rook** and **bishop**, plus two pawns.
- Black has only a **king** and one pawn.

White’s rook is deep in enemy territory on the 7th rank, pinning Black’s king. The bishop is also active. Black must be extremely careful not to blunder into checkmate or lose the last pawn.

Let’s evaluate each legal move:

---

### 🔹 1. `g8h8` – King to h8

Moves the king away from the center slightly. Keeps it off the open file where the rook can give check. Seems safe but passive.

### 🔹 2. `g8f7` – King captures rook

This would be a huge material gain... **but it's a trap!**

After `g8xf7`, White plays `Bd6+`, skewering the black king and threatening mate shortly after. Then:
- `Kf7-e6`
- `Bd6-c5` and White will bring the king over to promote.

This line leads to a **win for White** due to opposition and better king activity.

So, **do NOT play `g8f7`**.

---

### 🔹 3. `h7h6` – Solid defensive move

This prevents the bishop from using g5/h4 squares and gives the king a potential escape route via g7. Also avoids any back-rank issues.

Seems like a good waiting move that keeps the draw alive.

### 🔹 4. `h7h5` – Pawn push

This prepares ...h4, possibly leading to counterplay if White isn't careful. However, White could respond with `h4` themselves, fixing the pawn structure and keeping control.

Still, this move might offer more chances to complicate the game.

---

## ✅ Best Move Analysis

We must avoid capturing the rook (`g8f7`) as it loses.

Between `h7h6` and `h7h5`, we should aim to keep flexibility and possibly create some counterplay.

Pushing the pawn to **h5** now may allow us to later push h4 and disrupt White's structure if they're not careful.

Also, note that White cannot make progress without allowing some counterplay. This move keeps the tension and forces White to commit.

---

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King (g1), Rook (f7), Pawns (h3, g3)
- Black: King (g8), Pawn (h5)

**White to move.**

**Threats and Evaluation:**
- White is up a rook for a pawn, a decisive material advantage.
- Black's only pawn is on h5, but it is blockaded and cannot promote.
- White's king is safe, and Black's king is cut off on the back rank.
- The only way Black can hope for a draw is by perpetual check or stalemate, but with so little material, that's not possible unless White blunders.

**Plan:**
- White should aim to either checkmate the Black king or win the h5 pawn and promote a pawn.
- The Black king is on g8, and the rook on f7 already cuts off the 7th rank.
- Advancing the g-pawn (g3-g4) is tempting to win the h5 pawn, but let's check for any stalemate tricks.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Rf7-f5**: Prepares to play Rxh5, but allows Black to play h4, after which gxh4 is possible.
2. **Rf7-f6**: Similar idea, but less direct.
3. **g3-g4**: Directly attacks the h5 pawn. If h5xg4, h3xg4, and White will have two connected passed pawns.
4. **h3-h4**: Fixes the pawn on h5, but doesn't threaten anything immediately.
5. **King moves**: Not urgent; the king is already close enough.

**Checking for Stalemate:**
- After g4, if Black plays hxg4, then h4 is possible, but Black still has moves.
- After g4, if Black does nothing, White can play gxh5 next.

**Best Move:**
- **g4** is the most direct and forces the win of the h5 pawn, after which White will have two connected passed pawns and a rook, making checkmate trivial.

**Final move:**
```
g4

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

---

### **FEN Position:**
```
5Bk1/5R2/8/7p/6P1/7P/8/6K1 b - - 0 86
```

This is a late endgame with minimal material. Black has only a king and White has a bishop, rook, and two pawns (g4 and h3), while Black has a lone king on g8. It seems like White has been pushing pawns for promotion while Black tries to survive.

Black to move.

---

### **Legal Moves in UCI Notation:**

- `g8h8` — King moves to h8
- `g8f7` — King captures rook!
- `h5g4` — Pawn captures on g4
- `h5h4` — Pawn pushes to h4

We must evaluate each of these options.

---

## 🔍 Move Analysis:

### **1. `g8f7` — King captures the rook**

This is the most obvious and likely best move. The rook is hanging on f7, and capturing it removes one of White’s most dangerous pieces. After this, White still has a bishop and two pawns, but without the rook, their ability to push for a quick win is significantly reduced.

After `g8f7`, White will have to decide how to proceed with just a bishop and pawns.

**Pros:**
- Removes a strong attacker from the board.
- Simplifies the position.
- Likely forced.

**Cons:**
- Exposes the Black king slightly.
- Still leaves White with dangerous pawns.

➡️ This move should be played first.

---

### **2. `g8h8` — King stays passive**

This keeps the king on g8 or moves it to h8. It doesn't challenge any threats directly and allows White to continue pushing pawns or activating the bishop.

**Pros:**
- Safe

**Cons:**
- Does nothing to stop White's plan
- Wastes tempo

➡️ Weak move; not recommended.

---

### **3. `h5g4` — Pawn captures on g4**

This removes a dangerous passed pawn on g4, which could become a queen if unchecked.

However, after `h5g4`, White can play `hxg4` and still maintain a kingside majority with a bishop that may support the h-pawn.

Also, the rook on f7 remains active unless captured.

So while removing g4 is helpful, it doesn’t address the more urgent threat of the rook.

➡️ Less urgent than capturing the rook.

---

### **4. `h5h4` — Pushes the h-pawn**

This creates a potential passer on the h-file, but it also blocks the diagonal of White's bishop (Bf8), possibly helping Black avoid zugzwang.

Still, pushing a pawn forward without addressing the immediate danger of the rook and bishop coordination is risky.

➡️ A possible future idea, but not the top priority now.

---

## ✅ Final Evaluation:

The **most critical move** right now is **capturing the rook on f7**, which is completely undefended.

White probably missed this during their last move.

Capturing it removes a major threat and simplifies the position significantly.

---

### ✅ Best Move:
```
g8f7

2025-06-11 21:39:12,065 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.36s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King (g1), Bishop (f8), Pawns (g4, h3)
- Black: King (f7), Pawn (h5)

**White to move.**

**Assessment:**  
- White is up a bishop and has two pawns vs Black's lone pawn.
- Black's king is cut off from the queenside and cannot support the h-pawn.
- White's bishop on f8 is ideally placed to control the queening square of Black's h-pawn.
- White's king is close enough to support the advance of White's pawns or to help stop Black's pawn if needed.
- White's g4 pawn is ready to advance, and White can create a passed pawn on the kingside.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **g4-g5**: Advance the pawn, creating a passed pawn and threatening to push further.
2. **h3-h4**: Prepare to support the g-pawn's advance.
3. **King moves (g1-h2, g1-g2, etc.)**: Centralize the king, but less urgent than pushing the pawn.
4. **Bishop moves**: Not needed, as the bishop is perfectly placed to stop the h-pawn.

**Tactical Considerations:**
- If White pushes g5, Black cannot stop the pawn from advancing further.
- If Black pushes h4 after g5, White can play Bh6, and the h-pawn is stopped.
- White can create a passed pawn and use the king to support promotion.

**Calculation:**
- 1. g5 h4 (trying to advance the pawn)
- 2. Bh6 (stopping the pawn)
- White can then bring the king over to support the g-pawn's advance.

Alternatively:
- 1. g5 Kxf8 (if Black tries to activate the king)
- 2. g6 (White's pawn is unstoppable)

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to push the g-pawn, creating a passed pawn and threatening to promote. The bishop controls the h-pawn, and Black's king is too far to help.

**Final Move:**
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5Bk1/8/8/6Pp/8/7P/8/6K1 w - - 1 88

- White: King on g1, pawn on g5, pawn on h3
- Black: King on f8, pawn on h5

**Material:** Equal pawns, but White's king is closer to the center and Black's king is cut off. White's g-pawn is more advanced than Black's h-pawn. White to move.

**Legal moves:**
- King moves: g1h2, g1g2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1
- Pawn moves: g5g6, h3h4

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5g6**: Advance the passed pawn. If Black does nothing, White can play g7 next, and then promote. Black's king is too far to stop the pawn.
2. **h3h4**: Not urgent, as Black's h-pawn is not threatening to promote.
3. **King moves**: Not urgent, as the king is already supporting the g-pawn.

**Analysis:**
- After **g5g6**, Black cannot stop the pawn from promoting. For example:
    - 1. g5g6 h4 (trying to create counterplay)
    - 2. g7+ Kg8 (forced)
    - 3. Kxg2 Kxg7 (if Black tries to approach, but White will queen first)
    - White will promote the g-pawn before Black can promote the h-pawn.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to push the g-pawn.

My move is:
```
g5g6
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5k2/8/6P1/7p/8/7P/8/6K1 w - - 0 89

White: King on g1, pawn on g6, pawn on h3  
Black: King on f8, pawn on h5

White to move.

**Material:**  
White is up a pawn, and has a passed g6 pawn on the 6th rank, supported by the king. Black's king is on f8, and Black has a pawn on h5.

**Legal moves:**  
g1h2, g1g2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1, g6g7, h3h4

**Candidate moves:**

1. **g6g7**: Pushes the pawn to the 7th rank, threatening to queen next move. Black cannot stop the pawn from queening, as the king is too far away and the h-pawn is not fast enough.
2. **h3h4**: Prepares to stop Black's h-pawn, but is not urgent since White's g-pawn is about to queen.
3. **King moves**: Not urgent, as the pawn push is more direct.

**Analysis:**

- If 1. g6g7, Black can try 1...Kg8, but then 2. g7g8=Q# is checkmate.
- If 1. g6g7, Black can try 1...h4, but 2. g7g8=Q# is still checkmate.

**Conclusion:**  
The move g6g7 is unstoppable and leads to immediate promotion, and Black cannot prevent mate. This is the fastest and most decisive way to win.

**Final move:**
```
g6g7

2025-06-11 21:39:27,971 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 21:39:35,272 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.30s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 6k1/6P1/8/7p/8/7P/8/6K1 w - - 1 90  
**White:** King on g1, pawn on h3, pawn on g7  
**Black:** King on g8, pawn on h5

**Legal moves:**  
- g1h2 (King to h2)  
- g1g2 (King to g2)  
- g1f2 (King to f2)  
- g1h1 (King to h1)  
- g1f1 (King to f1)  
- h3h4 (pawn to h4)

**Position assessment:**  
White has a pawn on g7, one step from promotion, and a pawn on h3. Black has a king on g8 and a pawn on h5. It's White to move.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**  
- The g7 pawn is one step from queening, but Black's king is on g8, so g8=Q is not possible right now.
- Black's only counterplay is the h5 pawn, but it's far from queening.
- White's king is far from the action, but Black cannot stop the g7 pawn without giving up the h5 pawn.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. h3h4: Pushes the h-pawn, but doesn't immediately help.
2. King moves: Moving the king closer to the g7 pawn could help support promotion.

But let's look for a forced win:

- If White plays h3h4, Black has no way to stop g7-g8=Q next move, since the king cannot move to h7 or h8.
- If White moves the king, Black can try h4, but White can always respond with h4 themselves.

**Calculation:**
- 1. h3h4 h5h4 2. g7g8=Q and White queens.
- 1. h3h4 Kg7 (illegal, king can't move) or h5h4, same as above.

**Is there any stalemate trick?**
- After h3h4 h5h4 g7g8=Q, Black's king is on g8, pawn on h4. Black to move: only move is h4-h3.
- White can then play Qg3+ or Qh2, and the king can escape the corner.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play:
```
h3h4
```

2025-06-11 21:39:40,921 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.29s):
Let's analyze the position:

FEN: 8/6Pk/8/7p/7P/8/8/6K1 w - - 1 91

White: King on g1, pawn on h4, pawn on g7  
Black: King on h7, pawn on h5

It's White to move.

Legal moves:
- g1h2 (King to h2)
- g1g2 (King to g2)
- g1f2 (King to f2)
- g1h1 (King to h1)
- g1f1 (King to f1)
- g7g8q (Promote g7 pawn to queen)
- g7g8r (Promote g7 pawn to rook)
- g7g8b (Promote g7 pawn to bishop)
- g7g8n (Promote g7 pawn to knight)

Analysis:
- White is about to promote the g7 pawn.
- Black's king is on h7, so after g7g8=Q, Black cannot capture the queen.
- Black's only pawn is on h5, and White has a pawn on h4.
- Promoting to a queen is the most powerful move, as it gives White overwhelming material and a forced win.

Is there any risk of stalemate?
- After g7g8=Q, Black's king on h7 has h6 and h8 as escape squares, and Black can still move the h5 pawn.
- No stalemate risk.

Therefore, the best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

My move:
```
g7g8q

Legal moves in UCI notation: h7g8, h7h6

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

Let's analyze the position carefully.

---

### **Current Position (FEN):**
```
6Q1/7k/8/7p/7P/8/8/6K1 b - - 0 91
```

This is a late endgame with only a few pieces left:
- White has a queen on g8 and a king on g1.
- Black has a king on h7.
- Pawns are irrelevant: none can promote without being captured.

The key features of this position:
- White’s queen is on **g8**, one square away from delivering checkmate.
- Black’s king is on **h7**, cornered and vulnerable.
- Black to move.
- Legal moves for Black: `h7g8` or `h7h6`.

---

### **Candidate Moves:**

#### 1. `h7g8` – King moves into the center, away from the edge.
- This allows White to play `Qg8-g7#` next move — **checkmate**.
- Therefore, this move **loses immediately**.

#### 2. `h7h6` – King retreats toward h5.
- This avoids immediate checkmate.
- Let’s see what White can do after `h7h6`:
   - `Qg8-g7+` Kh6-h5
   - Then `Qg7-f7+` forces the king further down.
   - Eventually, White will maneuver the queen and force mate.

BUT...

White already has a forced mate in a few moves regardless of what Black does. So Black must avoid walking into mate and try to survive as long as possible.

---

### **Best Move Analysis:**

- `h7g8` leads to instant checkmate after `Qg8-g7#`.
- `h7h6` delays the inevitable but doesn't lose immediately.

Thus, **only legal move that doesn’t lose instantly** is:

```
h7h6
```

Even though it cannot save the game, it avoids **immediate checkmate** and gives the slightest chance if opponent makes a mistake.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:
```
h7h6
```

2025-06-11 21:39:57,885 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 6Q1/8/7k/7p/7P/8/8/6K1 w - - 1 92  
White: King on g1, Queen on g8, Pawn on h4  
Black: King on h6, Pawn on h5

**White to move.**

**Material:** White is up a queen for a pawn.  
**Threats:** Black has no immediate threats. The only danger is stalemating the Black king or allowing perpetual checks (which is impossible here).  
**Goal:** Checkmate Black as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qg5#** — This is checkmate. The Black king on h6 is boxed in by its own pawn on h5, White's pawn on h4, and the queen covers all escape squares.

**Double-check for stalemate:**  
- Black king on h6, pawn on h5.  
- After Qg5#, Black king cannot move to h7 (covered by queen), g7 (covered by queen), h5 (covered by queen), g6 (covered by queen), and the pawn on h5 blocks h5.  
- Black is checkmated, not stalemated.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is the immediate checkmate.

- White: King on g1, Queen on g5, Pawn on h4
- Black: King on h7, Pawn on h5

It's White to move.

**Immediate threats and goals:**
- Black's king is on the edge (h7), with a pawn on h5. White's queen and king are well placed to restrict the Black king.
- The Black pawn on h5 is not dangerous and can be captured at will.
- White's main goal is to checkmate the Black king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Qxh5+ (captures the pawn, gives check)
- Qf6 (cuts off more escape squares)
- Qe7 (cuts off more escape squares)
- Qg6+ (forces the king to h8)
- Qg2 (prepares to bring the king up)
- h5 (pushes the pawn, but not urgent)

Let's check the most forcing moves:

1. **Qg6+**
   - If ...Kh8, then Qxh5+ Kg8 (only move), Qg5+ Kf7, Qg6+ Ke7, etc. But the king is stuck on the edge.

2. **Qxh5+**
   - If ...Kg7, then Qg5+ Kf7, Qg6+ Ke7, etc.
   - If ...Kg8, then Qg6+ Kh8, Qxh5+ Kg8, etc.

But after Qxh5+, Black's king is forced to g7. Then Qg5+ forces the king back to h7, and we repeat.

3. **Qf6**
   - No check, but threatens Qg5+ and Qg7# ideas.

4. **Qe7+**
   - Forces Kh8, then Qg5 (threatening Qg7#), but Black has no moves except h4-h3 (which is not dangerous).

But let's check for stalemate traps:
- If we play Qg7+ when the pawn is still on h5, it's mate.
- If we remove the pawn, and the king is on h7 with no pawns, and we play Qg7, it's stalemate.

But here, Black still has a pawn, so no stalemate yet.

**Best move:**

The most forcing move is:
```
Qg6+
```

This keeps the Black king on the edge, and after Kh8, Qxh5+ wins the pawn with check, and then White can proceed to checkmate with the queen and king.

So, my move is:
```
g5g6
```

Let's analyze the current position carefully.

---

### **FEN:**
`8/7k/6Q1/7p/7P/8/8/6K1 b - - 4 93`

This is a late endgame. You are playing as **Black**.

#### Board Position:
```
8 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
7 |   |   |   |   |   |   | k |
6 |   |   |   |   |   | Q |   |   |
5 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | p |
4 |   |   |   |   |   |   | P |   |
3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | K |
1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
    a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h
```

- White has only a queen and a pawn on h4.
- Black has a king on h7, and a passed pawn on h5.
- It's your move (Black).

---

### **Legal Moves:**
- `h7h8`: Move king to h8
- `h7g6`: Move king to g6

We must evaluate both moves for long-term strategy and tactical danger.

---

## 🔍 Candidate Move Analysis:

### **1. ... Kg6 (`h7g6`)**
- King comes closer to the center of the board.
- This allows Black to potentially support the h5-pawn.
- Also prepares to race the king toward the queenside if needed.
- Keeps the king active and central.

**Tactical Note:** After `... Kg6`, White may try to push `h5` soon, but Black can respond with `Kg7` or `Kh7` depending on how things unfold.

### **2. ... Kh8 (`h7h8`)**
- King retreats to the corner.
- Less flexible positioning.
- Does not help in supporting any pawns or creating counterplay.
- Gives White more freedom to maneuver the queen and push h5.

---

## 🧠 Conclusion:

Black needs to **stay active**, keep the king involved, and be ready to contest White’s plans. Moving the king to **g6** keeps it in the game and gives more flexibility.

White likely wants to push `h5` and promote their own pawn. Black must prevent that while also keeping options open.

Thus, the best move is:

```
h7g6
```

2025-06-11 21:40:28,783 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.75s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/6k1/7p/7P/8/8/6K1 w - - 0 94  
White: King on g1, pawn on h4  
Black: King on g6, pawn on h5

It's White to move.

**Legal moves:**  
- g1h2 (King to h2)  
- g1g2 (King to g2)  
- g1f2 (King to f2)  
- g1h1 (King to h1)  
- g1f1 (King to f1)

**Analysis:**

- White is up a pawn, but Black's king is close to the h-pawn.
- The main plan is to support the h-pawn's advance and promote it.
- The Black king is on g6, blocking the pawn from advancing to h5-h6.
- If White plays h4-h5, Black can simply capture with the king.
- If White plays a king move, Black may play Kf5 or Kf6, trying to approach the pawn.
- The best plan is to bring the king closer to support the pawn.

Let's consider each move:

1. **g1h2:** King approaches the pawn, aiming to support its advance.  
2. **g1g2:** King approaches the pawn, but h2 is closer to the pawn's promotion square.  
3. **g1f2:** King approaches the pawn, but f2 is further from the pawn than h2.  
4. **g1h1:** King to h1, but this is passive and doesn't help.  
5. **g1f1:** King to f1, also passive.

**Best move:**  
g1h2 is the most direct way to support the pawn. From h2, the king can go to g3 or h3 to support h4-h5-h6.

**Check for stalemate or tricks:**  
There is no stalemate. Black's king has moves.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to bring the king closer to support the pawn.

2025-06-11 21:40:44,660 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 14.66s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/8/5k1p/7P/8/7K/8 w - - 2 95  
White: King on h2, pawn on h4  
Black: King on f5, pawn on h5

**White to move.**

**Legal moves:**  
- h2h3 (King to h3)
- h2g3 (King to g3)
- h2g2 (King to g2)
- h2h1 (King to h1)
- h2g1 (King to g1)

**Analysis:**

- White is up a pawn, but Black's king is very active and close to White's pawn.  
- If White plays h2h3, Black can play Kf4, threatening Kg4 and attacking the pawn.  
- If White plays h2g3, Black can play Ke4, again approaching the pawn.  
- If White plays h4h5, Black can simply take with Kf5xh5.  
- If White plays h2g2, Black can play Kg4, attacking the pawn.  
- If White plays h2h1, Black can play Kg4, threatening to take the pawn.

But White to move, and the pawn is on h4, so Black can't take it immediately.

**Key idea:**  
White must keep the king close to the pawn to support its advance, but also avoid letting Black's king invade. The best plan is to keep the king near the pawn and try to advance it at the right moment.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h2h3: King steps up, keeps close to the pawn.
2. h2g3: King steps toward the center, but further from the pawn.
3. h2g2: King steps to g2, but allows Black's king to approach.
4. h2h1: King steps back, but passive.
5. h2g1: King steps to g1, but passive.

**Let's check h2h3:**
- 1. h2h3 Kf4 (Black approaches)
- 2. h4h5 Kg5 (Black attacks pawn)
- 3. Kg3 (White king supports pawn)
- 4. ... h4+ (Black pushes pawn)
- 5. Kh3 (White king stays close)
- 6. ... Kxh5 (if Black takes, White king is close)
But Black can try to draw by sacrificing the pawn.

**What about h2g3?**
- 1. h2g3 Ke4 (Black approaches)
- 2. h4h5 Kf5 (Black attacks pawn)
- 3. Kh4 (White king supports pawn)
- 4. ... Kf6 (Black waits)
- 5. Kg4 (White king advances)
But Black can keep checking.

**What about h2g2?**
- 1. h2g2 Kg4 (Black attacks pawn)
- 2. h4h5 Kxh5 (Black takes pawn)
- 3. Kg3 (White king approaches)
But Black is up a pawn.

**What about h2h3?**
- 1. h2h3 Kf4
- 2. h4h5 Kg5
- 3. Kg3 h4+
- 4. Kh3 Kxh5
- 5. Kh2 Kg4
- 6. Kg2

But this seems to be a draw with best play.

**But if White plays h2g3:**
- 1. h2g3 Ke4
- 2. h4h5 Kf5
- 3. Kh4 Kf6
- 4. Kg4 Kg7
- 5. Kg5 Kh7
- 6. h6 h4
- 7. Kxh4 Kxh6

Again, looks like a draw.

**But if White plays h2h3, and Black plays Kf4, White can try to outflank:**
- 1. h2h3 Kf4
- 2. Kh4 Kf5
- 3. Kxh5

But Black's king is too close.

**But if White plays h2h3, and Black plays Kg4:**
- 1. h2h3 Kg4
- 2. Kg2 Kxh4

Black wins the pawn.

**But if White plays h2h3, and Black plays Ke5:**
- 1. h2h3 Ke5
- 2. h4h5 Kf5
- 3. Kg3 Kg5
- 4. h6 Kxh6
- 5. Kh4

But Black is too close.

**But if White plays h2g3, and Black plays Ke4:**
- 1. h2g3 Ke4
- 2. h4h5 Kf5
- 3. Kh4 Kf6
- 4. Kg4 Kg7
- 5. Kg5 Kh7
- 6. h6 h4
- 7. Kxh4 Kxh6

Draw.

**But if White plays h2h3, and Black plays Ke5:**
- 1. h2h3 Ke5
- 2. h4h5 Kf5
- 3. Kg3 Kg5
- 4. h6 Kxh6
- 5. Kh4

Again, draw.

**But if White plays h2h3, and Black plays Ke6:**
- 1. h2h3 Ke6
- 2. h4h5 Kf5
- 3. Kg3 Kg5
- 4. h6 Kxh6
- 5. Kh4

Again, draw.

**But if White plays h2h3, and Black plays Kg6:**
- 1. h2h3 Kg6
- 2. h4h5+ Kxh5
- 3. Kh3

Again, draw.

**But if White plays h2h3, and Black plays Kf6:**
- 1. h2h3 Kf6
- 2. h4h5 Kg5
- 3. Kg3 Kxh5

Again, draw.

**But if White plays h2h3, and Black plays Kg5:**
- 1. h2h3 Kg5
- 2. Kg3 h4+
- 3. Kh3 Kxh5

Again, draw.

**But if White plays h2h3, and Black plays Kf4:**
- 1. h2h3 Kf4
- 2. h4h5 Kg4
- 3. h6 h4
- 4. h7 h3
- 5. h8=Q

Wait, let's check this line:

1. h2h3 Kf4
2. h4h5 Kg4
3. h6 h4
4. h7 h3
5. h8=Q h2
6. Qxh2

White wins.

So, if Black plays Kf4, White can push h4-h5, and if Black plays Kg4, White pushes h5-h6, and then h7, and queens.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
h2h3
```

2025-06-11 21:40:50,993 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.05s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/4k3/7p/7P/7K/8/8 w - - 4 96  
White: King on h3, Pawn on h4  
Black: King on e6, Pawn on h5

**White to move. Legal moves:** h3g3, h3h2, h3g2

**Position assessment:**
- Both sides have only a king and a pawn.
- White's king is on h3, Black's king is on e6.
- Black's pawn is on h5, White's pawn is on h4.
- It's White to move.

**Strategic considerations:**
- White's king is closer to the queenside, but both pawns are on the h-file.
- Black's king is centralized and can potentially support the advance of the h5 pawn.
- White's king is cut off from the center and queenside, but is in front of the pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h3g3: King moves toward the center, possibly to stop Black's king from advancing.
2. h3h2: King steps back, but doesn't seem to help.
3. h3g2: King moves toward the center, but a bit further from the pawn.

**Analysis:**

- If 1. h3g3, Black can play Kf5, heading toward the pawn race.
- If 1. h3h2, Black can play Kf5, and White is further from the action.
- If 1. h3g2, Black can play Kf5, and White is further from the center.

**Best move:**
- h3g3 keeps the king closer to the center and allows White to approach the Black king if needed.
- h3g3 is the most active move, keeping options open.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play the king toward the center with h3g3.

```

2025-06-11 21:40:57,356 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.00s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/8/5k1p/7P/6K1/8/8 w - - 6 97  
White: King on g3, pawn on h4  
Black: King on f5, pawn on h5

**Legal moves:**  
- g3h3 (King to h3)  
- g3f3 (King to f3)  
- g3h2 (King to h2)  
- g3g2 (King to g2)  
- g3f2 (King to f2)

**Position assessment:**  
White is up a pawn and has a passed h-pawn. Black's king is more active, but White's king is close enough to support the pawn. The key is to avoid stalemate tricks and to keep the Black king from getting in front of the h-pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
- **g3h3:** King steps toward the pawn, but h3 is not necessary yet.
- **g3f3:** King steps toward the center, but this allows Black's king to approach the pawn.
- **g3h2:** King steps away, but this is passive.
- **g3g2:** King stays on the same file, but this is passive.
- **g3f2:** King steps toward the center, but again, not optimal.

**Best move:**  
The best move is **g3h3**. This keeps the king close to the pawn, ready to support its advance. If Black plays ...Ke4, White can continue with Kg3-g4 and then h4-h5-h6, and the king can shepherd the pawn to promotion.

**Calculation:**  
1. g3h3 Ke4  
2. h4-h5 Kf5  
3. Kh4 (or Kg3) and then h6, and the pawn promotes.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play the king to h3, staying close to the pawn and ready to support its advance.

2025-06-11 21:41:04,975 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.33s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/4k3/7p/7P/7K/8/8 w - - 8 98  
White: King on h3, Pawn on h4  
Black: King on e6, Pawn on h5

**Legal moves:**  
- h3g3 (King to g3)  
- h3h2 (King to h2)  
- h3g2 (King to g2)

**Assessment:**  
- Material: Equal (both sides have a king and a pawn on the h-file)
- Black's king is centralized and closer to the action.  
- White's king is on h3, Black's pawn is on h5, White's pawn is on h4.  
- It's White to move.

**Strategic goals:**  
- Prevent Black from advancing the h-pawn safely.  
- Try to use the king to support the h4 pawn and/or blockade Black's pawn.  
- Avoid allowing Black to create a passed pawn that cannot be stopped.

**Candidate moves:**

1. **h3g3:**  
   - King moves toward the center and toward the h5 pawn.
   - If Black plays Kf5, White can play Kf3, and the kings will be in opposition.
   - If Black pushes h4, White can play Kg4 and attack the pawn.

2. **h3g2:**  
   - King moves away from the action, less active.

3. **h3h2:**  
   - King stays on the back rank, less active.

**Calculation after h3g3:**

- 1. h3g3 h5h4  
  - 2. Kg4 Kf6  
    - 3. Kxh4 Kf5  
      - 4. Kg3 (White can hold the opposition and stop Black's king from advancing)
  - 2. ... Kf5  
    - 3. Kf3 (opposition)

- 1. h3g3 Kf5  
  - 2. Kf3 (opposition)

**Conclusion:**  
- h3g3 is the most active move, moving the king toward the center and the pawn, and keeps the opposition.  
- The other moves are passive and allow Black to make progress.

**Final move:**
```
h3g3

2025-06-11 21:41:06,246 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 21:41:13,010 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.76s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/8/7p/7P/6K1/8/8 w - - 10 99  
White: King on g3, Pawn on h4  
Black: King on f7, Pawn on h5

It's White to move. The only pawns left are on the h-file, and both kings are close to the action. Black's king is on f7, White's on g3. Black's pawn is on h5, White's on h4.

**Legal moves:**  
g3f4, g3h3, g3f3, g3h2, g3g2, g3f2

**Goal:** Win if possible, avoid stalemate or perpetual, and prevent Black from queening.

**Analysis:**

- If White plays g3f4, the king approaches the Black king and pawn, but Black can play Kf6, keeping opposition and defending the pawn.
- If White plays g3h3, the king stays near the pawn, but doesn't make progress.
- If White plays g3f3, the king stays central.
- If White plays g3h2, the king moves away from the action.
- If White plays g3g2 or g3f2, the king moves away from the pawn.

**Critical point:**  
White must not allow Black to get the opposition and must not allow Black's king to penetrate or support the pawn advance. White must also avoid stalemate.

**Best plan:**  
White should approach the Black pawn and try to capture it. The move g3f4 is the most active, approaching the pawn and king.

Let's check for any stalemate traps:

- After g3f4, if Black plays Kf6, White can play Ke4 and approach the pawn.
- If Black pushes h4, White can play Kg4 and capture the pawn after h3.

**Calculation:**

1. g3f4 Kf6
2. Ke4 Ke6 (if Black keeps opposition)
3. Kf4 Kf6
4. h4 (if Black waits)
5. Kg4 Kg6
6. h5+ Kh6
7. Kh4

White will eventually win the pawn and the game.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to approach the Black pawn and king with g3f4.

**Final move:**
```
g3f4
```

2025-06-11 21:41:19,790 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.50s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k3/8/8/7p/5K1P/8/8/8 w - - 12 100  
White: King on f4, pawn on h4  
Black: King on e8, pawn on h5

**Legal moves:**  
- f4g5 (King to g5)
- f4f5 (King to f5)
- f4e5 (King to e5)
- f4e4 (King to e4)
- f4g3 (King to g3)
- f4f3 (King to f3)
- f4e3 (King to e3)

**Position assessment:**
- Material: Both sides have a king and a pawn.
- White's pawn is on h4, Black's pawn is on h5.
- Black's king is on e8, far from the pawns.
- White's king is on f4, much closer to both pawns.

**Strategic goals:**
- White should aim to win Black's h5 pawn and then promote the h-pawn.
- Black's king is too far to stop White's king from taking the h5 pawn.
- White must avoid stalemating Black or allowing Black to sacrifice the pawn for a draw.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f4g5:** Directly attacks the h5 pawn. If Black plays Kf7, White can take h5 and win.
2. **f4f5:** Approaches the h5 pawn, but g5 is more direct.
3. **f4e5:** Moves away from the pawn, not optimal.
4. **f4e4:** Moves away from the pawn, not optimal.
5. **f4g3, f4f3, f4e3:** All move away from the pawn, not optimal.

**Calculation:**
- After 1. Kg5, Black has no way to defend h5.
- 1... Kf7 (or any king move) 2. Kxh5, and White will promote the pawn.
- Black cannot reach the h-pawn in time.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to play **Kg5**, attacking the h5 pawn directly and ensuring a win.

**Final move:**
```
f4g5
```

White: King on g5, pawn on h4  
Black: King on f7, pawn on h5

**Legal moves:**  
- g5h6 (King to h6)  
- g5h5 (King takes pawn on h5)  
- g5f5 (King to f5)  
- g5f4 (King to f4)

**Analysis:**

- **g5h5:** This captures the h5 pawn, leaving White with a pawn on h4 and King on h5. Black's King is on f7. White can then push h4-h5-h6-h7-h8=Q, and Black cannot stop the pawn.  
- **g5h6:** King to h6, threatening h4-h5 next, but Black can play Kf6 and try to approach the pawn.  
- **g5f5:** King to f5, but this doesn't threaten anything immediate.  
- **g5f4:** King to f4, moving away from the action.

**Critical lines:**

1. **g5h5**  
   If 1... Kf6, then 2. h4-h5, and White will easily queen the pawn.  
   If 1... Kg7, then 2. h4-h5, and again, White will queen.

2. **g5h6**  
   If 1... Kf6, then 2. h4-h5, but Black can try to approach the pawn.

**Conclusion:**  
The move **g5h5** immediately wins the pawn and secures a straightforward win. The White King will shepherd the h-pawn to promotion, and Black's King is too far to stop it.

**Final move:**
```
g5h5
```

2025-06-11 21:41:31,480 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.27s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/7K/7P/8/8/8 w - - 1 102  
White: King on h5, pawn on h4  
Black: King on e7

**Legal moves:** h5h6, h5g6, h5g5, h5g4

**Position assessment:**
- White is completely winning. The Black king is far away from the h-pawn, and White's king is perfectly placed to shepherd the pawn to promotion.
- The only thing to be careful about is not stalemating Black or allowing the Black king to approach.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h5h6:** King advances, supporting the pawn's advance. This is the most direct way to win.
2. **h5g6:** King moves toward the center, but this is less direct.
3. **h5g5:** King steps back, but this doesn't help.
4. **h5g4:** King steps away from the pawn, which is unnecessary.

**Best move:**
- **h5h6** is the most precise. It keeps the king in front of the pawn, which is the textbook winning method in king and pawn vs. king endgames. From here, White will play h4-h5-h6-h7-h8=Q, with the king always in front, and Black's king is too far to interfere.

**Final move:**
```
h5h6
```

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 5k2/8/7K/8/7P/8/8/8 w - - 3 103  
White: King on h6, pawn on h4  
Black: King on f8

It's White to move.

**Legal moves:**  
- h6h7 (King to h7)  
- h6g6 (King to g6)  
- h6h5 (King to h5)  
- h6g5 (King to g5)  
- h4h5 (Pawn to h5)

**Objective:**  
White is completely winning, but must avoid stalemate and play accurately to promote the pawn and checkmate Black.

**Candidate moves:**

1. **h4h5**  
   - This is the most direct way to make progress. The pawn advances, and the king is well placed to support its further advance.
   - Black's king is cut off from the h-file and cannot approach the pawn.
   - After h4-h5, Black has no legal moves except to shuffle the king on f8.

2. **King moves (h6h7, h6g6, h6h5, h6g5)**  
   - These do not make progress. The pawn must advance to win.

**Stalemate check:**  
- After h4-h5, Black still has f8 to move the king, so no stalemate.

**Best move:**  
Advance the pawn.

2025-06-11 21:41:44,618 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.03s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/7K/7P/8/8/8/8 w - - 1 104  
White: King on h6, Pawn on h5  
Black: King on e7

**Legal moves:**  
- h6h7 (King to h7)  
- h6g7 (King to g7)  
- h6g6 (King to g6)  
- h6g5 (King to g5)

**Evaluation:**

- White is completely winning. The Black king is far from the h-pawn, and White's king is perfectly placed to shepherd the pawn to promotion.
- The only thing to avoid is stalemate or allowing the Black king to get close enough to block the pawn.
- The main plan is to advance the pawn to h6, then h7, then promote, using the king to support.

**Move analysis:**

1. **h6h7:** King to h7. This is a waiting move, but after ...Kf7, White can play h5-h6, and then h7-h8=Q. However, after h7, Black can only shuffle the king, and White can proceed with h5-h6, then h7-h8=Q.
2. **h6g7:** King to g7. This keeps the king close to the pawn and allows h5-h6 next. The Black king is too far to interfere.
3. **h6g6:** King to g6. This is also fine, keeping opposition and supporting the pawn.
4. **h6g5:** King to g5. This is less optimal, as it moves away from the pawn.

**Best move:**

- The most direct and precise is to play **h5-h6** next, but that's not a legal move now (it's not White's pawn move, it's king move).
- The best king move is to keep the king close to the pawn and maintain control.

Between h6h7, h6g7, and h6g6, all win, but **h6h7** is the most forcing, as it keeps the king in front of the pawn, and after ...Kf7, White plays h5-h6, and then h7-h8=Q.

**Final move:**
```
h6h7

Legal moves in UCI notation: e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```

2025-06-11 21:42:18,126 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 33.24s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

---

### **FEN Position:**
```
8/4k2K/8/7P/8/8/8/8 b - - 2 104
```

This is a **king and pawn endgame**, with only the Black king on e7, White king on h7, and a White pawn on h5.

Black to move.

---

### **Goal for Black:**
Prevent promotion of the h-pawn. Ideally, draw by either:
- Blocking the pawn.
- Stalemate.
- King opposition.

White’s goal is clear: push the h-pawn to promote and win.

---

### **Legal Moves for Black (King on e7):**

| Move        | Resulting King Position |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| `e7f8`      | f8                      |
| `e7e8`      | e8                      |
| `e7d8`      | d8                      |
| `e7f7`      | f7                      |
| `e7d7`      | d7                      |
| `e7f6`      | f6                      |
| `e7e6`      | e6                      |
| `e7d6`      | d6                      |

We must find the **only drawing move** or at least delay the inevitable if no draw exists.

---

### **Step-by-step Evaluation:**

#### Let's evaluate each move:

---

#### **1. `e7f8` (Kf8)**

- White plays `h5h6`, then `Kh7–h8`, promotes h-pawn.
- Black king is too far away.
- **Result: Loss**

---

#### **2. `e7e8` (Ke8)**

- Same as above; king moves straight up.
- White pushes pawn and promotes.
- **Result: Loss**

---

#### **3. `e7d8` (Kd8)**

- Again, king goes to corner — no interference.
- White advances pawn freely.
- **Result: Loss**

---

#### **4. `e7f7` (Kf7)** ← **Strong Candidate**

- This move places the black king in **direct opposition** to the white king.
- It also **blocks** the white pawn from advancing without capture.
- After `e7f7`, if White plays `h5h6`, then `Kf7–g6` can challenge the pawn.
- This is the **only viable path to a draw**.

Let’s simulate a bit further:

1. ... Kf7  
2. h6 Kg6  
3. Kh8 Kxh6  
→ Draw by insufficient material (K vs K)

✅ **This line leads to a draw.**

---

#### **5. `e7d7` (Kd7)**

- Too passive.
- White can advance pawn and outflank.
- **Result: Loss**

---

#### **6. `e7f6` (Kf6)**

- Too far forward.
- White can play `Kh7`, then `h6`, `Kh8`, etc.
- No real control over pawn.
- **Result: Loss**

---

#### **7. `e7e6` (Ke6)**

- Too far back.
- White has free reign to advance pawn.
- **Result: Loss**

---

#### **8. `e7d6` (Kd6)**

- Also too far.
- No influence on key squares.
- **Result: Loss**

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**

Only **`e7f7`** keeps the game drawn. Any other move allows White to promote the pawn and win.

---

### Final Move:
```
e7f7

2025-06-11 21:42:22,108 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 3.73s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k1K/8/7P/8/8/8/8 w - - 3 105  
White: King on h7, Pawn on h5  
Black: King on f7

**Legal moves:**  
- h7h8 (King to h8)  
- h7h6 (King to h6)  
- h5h6 (Pawn to h6)

**Analysis:**

- The Black king is cut off from the h-file and cannot approach the pawn.
- Advancing the pawn with h5-h6 is the most direct way to promote. After h6, Black cannot stop the pawn from promoting.
- King moves (h7h8 or h7h6) do not make progress and may allow stalemate if not careful.

**Check for stalemate traps:**  
- After h5-h6, Black's only move is Kg8 (if possible), but currently, Black's king is on f7 and has moves.
- After h6, Black can play Kf8 or Kg8, but White will simply play h7 and then h8=Q.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to push the pawn:

```
h5h6
```

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: 8/4k2K/7P/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 1 106

White: King on h7, pawn on h6  
Black: King on e7

It's White to move. Legal moves: h7h8, h7g8, h7g7, h7g6

**Analysis:**

- White has a king on h7 and a pawn on h6. Black's king is on e7.
- The pawn is one square from promotion.
- Black's king is far away and cannot stop the pawn.
- The only thing to watch for is stalemate, but here, all moves are winning.

**Candidate moves:**
1. h7h8: King to h8. Black's king is still far away. Next move, h6h7, then h7h8=Q.
2. h7g8: King to g8. Same idea, but keeps the king closer to the center.
3. h7g7: King to g7. This is the most direct way to support the pawn's promotion.
4. h7g6: King to g6. Also supports the pawn.

**Best move:**

- The fastest way to promote is to play **h7g7**. This keeps the king close to the pawn, and next move is h6h7, then h7h8=Q. Black cannot stop this.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h7g7
```

2025-06-11 21:42:35,531 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.91s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6K1/3k3P/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 3 107  
White: King on g7, pawn on h6  
Black: King on d6

It's White to move.

**Legal moves:**  
g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7f7, g7g6, g7f6, h6h7

**Position evaluation:**  
- White is completely winning. The Black king is far away from the h-pawn, and White's king is perfectly placed to shepherd the pawn to promotion.
- The only thing to be careful about is stalemating Black or allowing any sort of perpetual, which is not possible here.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h6h7**: Push the pawn. This is the most direct way to promote. Black cannot stop the pawn from queening.
2. **g7h8**: Move the king to the corner. Not necessary and could lead to stalemate after h7 if Black's king is on the 8th rank, but currently Black's king is far away.
3. **g7h7**: Move the king in front of the pawn. This is a classic technique to promote the pawn safely.
4. **g7g8**: King to g8, keeping close to the pawn.
5. **g7f7**: King steps away, but not necessary.
6. **g7g6**: King steps back, not needed.
7. **g7f6**: King steps away, not needed.

**Best move:**
- **h6h7** is the most direct and fastest way to promote. After h7, next move is h8=Q, and Black cannot stop it.

**Check for stalemate:**  
After h6h7, Black's king is on d6 and has plenty of moves, so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
h6h7
```

2025-06-11 21:42:42,300 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.08s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k1KP/8/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 1 108  
White: King on g7, Pawn on h7  
Black: King on e7

**Legal moves:**  
- g7h8 (King to h8)  
- g7g8 (King to g8)  
- g7h6 (King to h6)  
- g7g6 (King to g6)  
- h7h8q (Pawn promotes to Queen)  
- h7h8r (Pawn promotes to Rook)  
- h7h8b (Pawn promotes to Bishop)  
- h7h8n (Pawn promotes to Knight)

**Analysis:**

- Promoting the pawn is the most forcing move.  
- h7h8q is the most natural, as it gives White a Queen.  
- After h7h8q, Black's king is on e7, and White has King on g7 and Queen on h8.  
- Black cannot stop mate: Qf8# is unstoppable, as the Black king is cut off from the f-file and the 8th rank.  
- There are no stalemate tricks: Black's king has moves, and White's king is not blocking any escape squares.

**Alternative promotions:**  
- h7h8r, h7h8b, h7h8n are all inferior to h7h8q, as the Queen is the most powerful and leads to the fastest mate.

**King moves:**  
- Moving the king (g7h8, g7g8, g7h6, g7g6) does not progress toward victory and only delays promotion.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to promote the pawn to a Queen with checkmate imminent.

My move:

h7h8q

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 7Q/6K1/3k4/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 1 109  
**White:** King on g7, Queen on h8  
**Black:** King on d6

It's White to move.

**Material:** White has a Queen and King, Black only a King.  
**Objective:** Checkmate Black as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Legal moves:**  
- Queen moves: h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8, h8h7, h8h6, h8h5, h8h4, h8h3, h8h2, h8h1  
- King moves: g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7f7, g7h6, g7g6, g7f6

**Analysis:**

- The Black King is on d6, not on the edge, so we need to drive it to the edge and then checkmate.
- The Queen and King are well placed to restrict the Black King.
- The Queen on h8 is far from the action, so centralizing it is a good idea.
- We must avoid stalemating the Black King.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h8d8**: Queen to d8, cutting off the Black King from the d-file and threatening to box it in.
2. **h8e8**: Queen to e8, similar idea, but d8 is more direct.
3. **h8g8**: Queen to g8, not as effective.
4. **King moves**: Not as effective as Queen moves for restricting the Black King.

**Best move:**  
**h8d8** is the most precise. It cuts off the Black King from advancing to the d-file, and starts the process of boxing the King in. The Queen is centralized and controls key squares.

**Final move:**
```
h8d8
```

2025-06-11 21:42:50,228 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 21:42:58,182 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.95s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3Q4/6K1/8/2k5/8/8/8/8 w - - 3 110

- White: King on g7, Queen on d8
- Black: King on c5

**Material:** White has a queen and king, Black only has a king. This is a basic queen vs king endgame.

**Objective:** Checkmate the Black king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- The Black king is on c5, so we want to restrict its movement and drive it to the edge/corner.
- The queen can cut off escape squares and force the king toward the edge.

**Legal moves for White:**
- Queen moves: d8h8, d8g8, d8f8, d8e8, d8c8, d8b8, d8a8, d8e7, d8d7, d8c7, d8f6, d8d6, d8b6, d8g5, d8d5, d8a5, d8h4, d8d4, d8d3, d8d2, d8d1
- King moves: g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7f7, g7h6, g7g6, g7f6

**Analysis:**
- The Black king is on c5, so let's see its escape squares: b4, b5, b6, c4, d4, d5, d6, c6.
- We want to cut off as many squares as possible.

**Best strategy:** Use the queen to cut off the king's escape squares, then bring the king closer to help deliver mate.

**Immediate tactics:**
- d8d6+ checks the king, but after Kc4, the king is not forced to the edge.
- d8c7+ checks the king, but after Kb5, the king is not forced to the edge.
- d8a5+ checks the king, but after Kd4, the king is not forced to the edge.
- d8d5+ checks the king, but after Kb4, the king is not forced to the edge.

But perhaps the most effective is to use the queen to cut off the king's escape to the 6th rank and 4th rank, then bring the king closer.

**Move d8d6** cuts off the 6th rank, and the king can only go to c4, b4, or b5.

After d8d6, if Kc4, then Qd4+ forces the king to b5 or b3, and so on.

Alternatively, d8a5+ forces the king to d4, and then Qd5+ forces the king to c3 or c4.

But let's check for stalemate: after d8d6, Black has c4, b4, b5 as possible moves, so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:** The move d8d6 is the most effective, as it cuts off the 6th rank and restricts the Black king's movement, allowing White to bring the king closer and proceed to checkmate.

**Final move:**
```
d8d6

2025-06-11 21:43:04,738 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.02s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King on g7, Queen on d6  
- Black: King on b5

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black's king is on b5, and White's queen and king are very active.  
- The Black king is on the edge of the board, and the White queen can cut off escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**  
- The goal is to checkmate or force the Black king to the edge and deliver mate.
- Let's look for checks and moves that restrict the Black king.

**Checks:**  
1. Qd6-d3+ (forces the king to a4 or b4)
2. Qd6-b6+ (forces the king to a4 or c4)
3. Qd6-d5+ (forces the king to a4 or b4)
4. Qd6-e5+ (forces the king to a4 or b4)
5. Qd6-c6+ (forces the king to a4 or b4)

But let's check if any of these are mate or lead to a forced mate.

**Let's analyze Qd6-b6+:**
- 1. Qb6+ Ka4 (if Kc4, then Qb3#)
- 1... Ka4
- Now, Qb3+ is mate (since the king can't go to a5, b5, or a3).

So, 1. Qb6+ Kc4 2. Qb3# is mate.

If 1... Ka4, then 2. Qb3+ Ka5 (only move), 3. Qb5# is mate.

**Therefore, Qb6+ is a forced mate in 2.**

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 21:43:18,074 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-235b-a22b) (took 12.95s):
Let's analyze the current position carefully.

### FEN:
`8/6K1/1Q6/1k6/8/8/8/8 b - - 6 111`

This is a **king and queen vs. king and pawn** endgame. White has a queen on b6 and a king on g7, while Black has only a king on b5. It's Black to move.

### Goal:
Black must avoid checkmate and prevent promotion of White's pawn (which is not yet on the board). The key for Black is to stay out of checkmate and avoid allowing White to promote their pawn with support from the queen.

### Legal Moves:
- `b5b6`: Moving the king to b6.
- `b5c4`: Moving the king to c4.
- `b5a4`: Moving the king to a4.

We need to evaluate each move:

---

#### 1. `b5b6`
- King moves to b6.
- White can respond with `Qa6+`, forcing the black king away.
- After `Kc7`, White can play `Qa7+`, continuing to push the king toward the edge.
- This line leads to a **quick mating net**, as the black king gets cornered.

#### 2. `b5c4`
- King moves to c4.
- White can play `Qa6`, threatening `Qa4+` next.
- Again, this leads to a forced sequence where the black king is driven to the edge or mated.

#### 3. `b5a4`
- King moves to a4.
- White can respond with `Qd6`, keeping control over central squares.
- This gives Black more room to maneuver and delays the mating net.
- Crucially, it avoids immediate checks that help White coordinate better.

---

### Best Move:
The goal is to survive as long as possible and avoid being checkmated. Among all legal moves, **`b5a4`** offers the most resistance and minimizes White’s immediate attacking chances.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King on g7, Queen on b6  
- Black: King on a4

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black's king is on the edge of the board, and White's queen and king are very close. This is a classic queen and king vs. king endgame, and White should be able to force mate quickly.

**Candidate moves:**  
- The goal is to restrict the Black king and drive it to the edge/corner for mate.  
- The Black king is already on a4, so we should look for a way to deliver mate or force the king to a corner.

**Check for immediate mate:**  
- b6b4# is not possible (queen is on b6, king on a4, so b4 is not a legal move).
- b6b5+ is not check, as the king is on a4.
- b6c5+ is check, but king can go to b3 or b5.
- b6d4+ is check, king can go to a3 or b3.
- b6a6 is not check, but restricts the king.
- b6b7, b6b8, b6c7, etc., are not checks.

**What about king moves?**  
- g7h8, g7g8, etc., are not checks and do not help.

**Best approach:**  
- The fastest way is to use the queen to restrict the Black king's movement, then bring the White king closer if needed.

**Try b6c5+:**
- If 1. Qc5+ K moves to b3 or b5.
    - 1...Kb3: Then Qb5+ forces the king back to a2 or a3.
    - 1...Kb5: Then Qb5# is mate.

Wait, let's check that:

1. Qc5+ Kb5

Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

2025-06-11 21:43:25,537 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 21:43:32,520 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.98s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6K1/8/2Q5/8/1k6/8/8 w - - 9 113  
White: King on g7, Queen on c5  
Black: King on b3

**White to move.**

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- Black's king is on b3, far from the White king and queen.
- White's king is on g7, queen on c5. Black has no pieces.
- The goal is to checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qb5+ (forces the king to a2 or c2)
2. Qd5+ (forces the king to a4 or c4)
3. Qc1 (cuts off the king on the c-file)
4. Qd4 (centralizes, but not a check)
5. Qe3+ (forces king to a4 or c4)
6. Qg1 (cuts off the king on the g-file, but not relevant here)

**Let's check Qb5+:**
- 1. Qb5+ Kc3 (only move)
- 2. Qc5+ Kd3 (only move)
- 3. Qd5+ Ke3 (only move)
- 4. Qe5+ Kf3 (only move)
- 5. Qf5+ Kg3 (only move)
- 6. Qg5+ Kh3 (only move)
- 7. Qg3#

But wait, the Black king is on b3, so after Qb5+, the only legal move is Kc3.

Alternatively, let's try to cut the king off and bring the king closer.

But since the king is so far away, the fastest is to use the queen to force the king to the edge and then bring the king in.

**But the fastest is to check and restrict the king.**

**Let's check Qb5+:**
- 1. Qb5+ Kc3
- 2. Qc5+ Kd3
- 3. Qd5+ Ke3
- 4. Qe5+ Kf3
- 5. Qf5+ Kg3
- 6. Qg5+ Kh3
- 7. Qg1

But the Black king is on b3, so after Qb5+, Kc3 is forced.

Alternatively, let's check Qd4:
- 1. Qd4 Ka3 (only move)
- 2. Qc3+ Ka4
- 3. Qc4+ Ka5
- 4. Qb5#

But the king is on b3, so Qd4 is not a check.

**Best is to check and restrict the king.**

**So, Qb5+ is the best move.**

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>

For example:
```

2025-06-11 21:43:44,637 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 10.30s):
Let's analyze the position:

- Material: White has a queen and king. Black has only a king.
- The black king is on c2. White's king is on g7, queen on b5.
- It's White to move.

Goal: Checkmate the black king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate threats and considerations:**
- The black king is on c2, with squares b2, b3, c3, d3, d2, d1, c1, b1 available.
- We must avoid stalemating the black king (i.e., don't cut off all escape squares unless it's checkmate).
- The white king is far away, so queen must do most of the work.

**Candidate moves:**
- b5e2: Queen cuts off the 2nd rank, but does not check.
- b5b4+: Queen check, king must move.
- b5c4+: Queen check, king must move.
- b5a4+: Queen check, king must move.
- b5d3+: Queen check, king must move.
- b5e5: Queen centralizes, no check.
- b5c6: Queen controls more squares, no check.
- b5b7: Queen stays on b-file, no check.
- b5b8: Queen stays on b-file, no check.

**Check moves:**
- b5b4+ (forces king to b3 or c3)
- b5c4+ (forces king to b2 or d3)
- b5a4+ (forces king to b2 or b3)
- b5d3+ (forces king to d1, d2, c3)

Let's check for the fastest mate.

**Option 1: b5b4+**
- If Kxb4, not possible.
- If Kc3, then Qc5+ forces king back.
- If Kb3, then Qb3# is mate.

But after b5b4+, if Kb3, Qb3# is checkmate.

**Option 2: b5c4+**
- If Kd3, Qd4# is mate.
- If Kb2, Qb3# is mate.

So b5c4+ is also a mate in 1 if king goes to b2.

But let's check the moves:

After b5c4+:
- If Kd3, Qd4# is mate.
- If Kb2, Qb3# is mate.

But the king is on c2, so after b5c4+, the only legal moves are Kd1, Kd2, Kd3, b3, b2.

But let's check the possible moves:

From c2, after Qc4+:
- Kd1
- Kd2
- Kd3
- b2
- b3

So not mate in 1.

**Option 3: b5a4+**
- If Kb2, Qb3# is mate.
- If Kb3, Qb3# is mate.

So b5a4+, if Kb2 or Kb3, Qb3#.

But from c2, after Qa4+, king can go to d3, d2, d1.

So not mate in 1.

**Option 4: b5d3+**
- If Kd1, Qd1# is mate.
- If Kd2, Qd2# is mate.
- If Kc3, Qc4# is mate.

So after Qd3+, if Kd1, Qd1#; if Kd2, Qd2#; if Kc3, Qc4#.

But from c2, after Qd3+, king can go to d1, d2, c3.

So not mate in 1.

**Option 5: b5b4+**
- If Kb3, Qb3# is mate.
- If Kc3, Qc5# is mate.

From c2, after Qb4+, king can go to b3 or c3.

- Kb3: Qb3#.
- Kc3: Qc5#.

So b5b4+ is mate in 2, regardless of where the king goes.

**Is there a mate in 1?**

No, because the king has too many escape squares.

**Best move: b5b4+**

This forces mate next move, regardless of Black's reply.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b5b4
```

2025-06-11 21:43:55,763 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.58s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6K1/8/8/1Q6/3k4/8/8 w - - 13 115  
White: King on g7, Queen on b4  
Black: King on d3

**Material:** White has a queen and king, Black only a king.  
**Objective:** Checkmate the black king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Black's king is on d3, with escape squares: c3, c4, d4, e3, e4, e2, d2, c2.**  
But White's queen on b4 controls b4, c4, d4, e4, f4, b3, b2, b1, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, c5, d6, e7, f8, etc.

**Candidate moves:**
- Move the queen to cut off the black king's escape squares, but avoid stalemate.
- Move the king closer to help with mate.

**Immediate checks:**
- b4b3+ (forces king to e2 or c2)
- b4d2+ (forces king to c3 or e3)
- b4e1+ (forces king to d2)
- b4d6 (no check, but cuts off d-file)
- b4b5 (no check, but cuts off 5th rank)
- g7h8, g7g8, etc. (king moves, but not urgent)

**Best plan:**  
- Use the queen to cut off the king, then bring the king closer for mate.
- Avoid stalemate (don't box the king in with no moves).

**Check for forced mate:**  
- b4b3+ Kc2 (or Ke2)
- Then bring the king closer.

But let's see if we can make progress with a queen move that restricts the king.

**Let's try b4b5:**  
- This cuts off the 5th rank, and the king still has moves.

**Or b4d6:**  
- This cuts off the d-file, but the king can still move.

**Or b4e1:**  
- This checks, king must go to d2.

**Or b4d2:**  
- This checks, king must go to c3 or e3.

But after b4d2+ Kc3, then Qb5, then Kd3, and so on.

**But the fastest is to check and force the king to the edge.**

**Let's try b4b3+:**
- If Kc2, then Qb4+ Kd3, then Qd4+ Kc2, Qc3+ Kd1, Qb2, etc.
- If Ke2, then Qb2+ Kd3, Qd4+ Kc2, Qc3+ Kd1, Qb2, etc.

This is the standard queen and king vs king technique.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
b4b3

2025-06-11 21:43:57,522 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 21:44:04,473 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.95s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6K1/8/8/8/1Q6/3k4/8 w - - 15 116  
White: King on g7, Queen on b3  
Black: King on d2

**Material:** White has a Queen and King, Black only has a King.  
**Objective:** Checkmate the Black King as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Key points:**
- Black's king is on d2, surrounded by empty squares.
- White's king is on g7, far from the action.
- White's queen is on b3, controlling the b-file and the third rank.

**Immediate threats:**  
- Avoid stalemate: Black's king has several escape squares (c1, c2, c3, d1, d3, e1, e2, e3), so no risk of stalemate yet.
- The goal is to restrict the Black king and drive it to the edge, then deliver mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qb2+**: Checks the king, forcing it to move. After Kd1, Qb1# is mate.
2. **Qb4**: Cuts off the d-file, but not a check.
3. **Qd5+**: Checks, but allows the king to escape to e3 or c3.
4. **Qb1**: Prepares to checkmate if the king moves to d1.

**Calculation:**
- **Qb2+**:  
    - If Kd1, then Qb1# is mate.
    - If Kd3, then Qb3 is mate.
    - If Ke1, then Qb1+ and then Qb2#.
    - If Ke2, then Qb2 is mate.

But let's check the actual legal moves for Black after Qb2+:

- From d2, after Qb2+, Black can go to:
    - d1
    - e1
    - c1
    - c2
    - e2
    - c3
    - d3
    - e3

But actually, after Qb2+, the only legal moves are:
- Kd1
- Ke1
- Kc1
- Kc2
- Ke2
- c3
- d3
- e3

But let's just check the main line:

1. Qb2+ Kd1
2. Qb1#

**This is forced mate in 2.**

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b3b2
```

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

2025-06-11 21:44:10,991 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.75s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position:**
- White: King on g7, Queen on b2
- Black: King on e3

**Material:** White has a queen and king, Black only a king.

**Objective:** Checkmate Black as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- b2b3+ (Queen check, forces king to f4 or d4)
- b2e5 (Queen centralizes, controls more squares)
- b2c3 (Queen cuts off king's escape squares)
- g7g8 (King move, but unnecessary)
- b2b6 (Queen cuts off king's escape squares)
- b2f6 (Queen check, but king can escape)
- b2b8 (Queen move, but not forcing)

**Analysis:**
- b2b3+ is a check. After ...Ke4, White can continue with Qb4+ and drive the king to the edge.
- b2e5 is not a check, but centralizes the queen.
- b2b6 is not a check, but restricts the king.

**Best move:**
- b2b3+ is forcing and keeps the king restricted.

**Check for stalemate:**
- After b2b3+, Black must move. No stalemate.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
b2b3
```

2025-06-11 21:44:17,680 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.18s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King on g7, Queen on b3  
- Black: King on f4

**White to move.**

**Legal moves:**  
- Queen moves: b3g8, b3b8, b3f7, b3b7, b3e6, b3b6, b3d5, b3b5, b3c4, b3b4, b3a4, b3h3, b3g3, b3f3, b3e3, b3d3, b3c3, b3a3, b3c2, b3b2, b3a2, b3d1, b3b1
- King moves: g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7f7, g7h6, g7g6, g7f6

**Goal:**  
- Deliver checkmate or force a win with no counterplay.

**Analysis:**

The Black king is on f4, and White's king is on g7, queen on b3. The Black king is cut off from the 5th rank and the e-file by the queen, and the White king is close enough to help. The best way to proceed is to restrict the Black king further and look for a forced mate.

**Candidate moves:**
- b3f7+ (forces the Black king to e5 or g5)
- b3b4+ (forces the Black king to e5 or g5)
- b3d5+ (forces the Black king to f5 or e4)
- King moves: Not immediately threatening.

Let's check the forcing checks:

1. **b3f7+**
   - If K moves to e5: White can play Qf5# (mate).
   - If K moves to g5: White can play Qf5# (mate).

So, let's check:
- 1. Qf7+ Ke5 2. Qf5# (mate)
- 1. Qf7+ Kg5 2. Qf5# (mate)

**Conclusion:**  
The move **b3f7+** leads to forced mate in one after any king move.

**Final move:**
```
b3f7

2025-06-11 21:44:27,114 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.84s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5QK1/8/8/8/4k3/8/8 w - - 21 119  
White: King on g7, Queen on f7  
Black: King on e3

It's White to move.

**Material:**  
White is up a queen, Black only has a king.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White can checkmate in one move if possible.
- Black's king is on e3, with no escape squares except d4, f4, d3, f3, d2, e2, f2, but all are covered by the queen or king.

**Candidate moves:**  
- Qf7f3+ (forces the king to move, but not mate)
- Qf7e6+ (forces the king to move, but not mate)
- Qf7f5+ (forces the king to move, but not mate)
- Qf7e7 (no check)
- Qf7b3 (no check)
- Qf7g6 (no check)
- Qf7f8 (no check)
- Qf7h5 (no check)
- Qf7f4 (no check)
- Qf7f2 (no check)
- Qf7f1 (no check)
- Qf7a7 (no check)
- Qf7c7 (no check)
- Qf7d7 (no check)
- Qf7e8 (no check)
- Qf7g8 (no check)
- Qf7h7 (no check)
- Qf7h8 (no check)

But let's look for a forced mate.

**Checkmate patterns:**  
- The king is on e3. If we play Qf7f3, the king can go to d4 or d3, but both are covered by the queen and king.
- Let's check Qf7f3+:

1. Qf7f3+  
   - If Ke4, then Qf3f4# (mate)
   - If Kd4, then Qf3f4# (mate)
   - If Kd3, then Qf3d1 (not mate)
   - If Kd2, then Qf3d1 (not mate)
   - If Kf2, then Qf3f2 (mate)
   - If Kf3, then Qf3f2 (mate)
   - If Kf4, then Qf3f4# (mate)
   - If Ke2, then Qf3e2 (mate)

But let's check if Qf7f3+ is mate in one.  
- After Qf7f3+, Black's king has only e2 and f2 as legal moves, both of which are covered by the queen.  
- Actually, after Qf7f3+, Black's king is on e3, and all adjacent squares are covered by the queen or the king on g7.

Let's check the squares:
- d4: covered by queen
- e4: covered by queen
- f4: covered by queen
- d3: covered by queen
- f3: covered by queen
- d2: covered by queen
- e2: covered by queen
- f2: covered by queen

So after Qf7f3+, the king on e3 has no legal moves and is in check. That is checkmate.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:

```
f7f3
```

2025-06-11 21:44:35,911 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.96s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6K1/8/8/3k4/5Q2/8/8 w - - 23 120

- White: King on g7, Queen on f3
- Black: King on d4

It's White to move. Black's king is exposed in the center, and White's queen and king are very active. The goal is to checkmate or force a decisive advantage.

Let's look for forced mates or a way to drive the Black king to a vulnerable square.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qf4+ — Forces the Black king to c5 or d3.
2. Qf6+ — Forces the Black king to e4 or c5.
3. Qf2+ — Forces the Black king to e4 or c3.
4. Qg4+ — Forces the Black king to c5 or e5.
5. Qe2 — Not a check, but could be useful for triangulation.

Let's check the most forcing move: **Qf4+**

- 1. Qf4+ Kc5 (if Ke3, then Qf3+ wins the queen)
- 1... Kc5
  - 2. Qe5+ Kc4 (if Kb4, then Qb2#)
  - 2... Kc4
    - 3. Qe4+ Kc5
    - 3. Qe4+ Kb3 (if Kb4, then Qb2#)
    - 3. Qe4+ Kb3
      - 4. Qb1+ Kc3
      - 4. Qb1+ Ka3
      - 4. Qb1+ Ka4

Alternatively, let's check **Qf6+**

- 1. Qf6+ Ke4 (if Kc5, then Qe5#)
- 1... Ke4
  - 2. Qg5 (threatening Qg4#)
  - 2. Qe6+ Kd4
  - 2. Qg4+ Ke3
  - 2. Qg4+ Kd3

But after **Qf6+ Kc5 Qe5#** is checkmate.

Let's check this:

1. Qf6+ Kc5
2. Qe5#

So, **Qf6+** is a forced mate in 2.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f3f6

2025-06-11 21:44:53,286 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 15.59s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6K1/5Q2/2k5/8/8/8/8 w - - 25 121  
White: King on g7, Queen on f6  
Black: King on c5

**Material:** White has a queen and king, Black only has a king.  
**Objective:** Checkmate the Black king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Legal moves:**  
- Queen moves: f6 can go to any square along the f-file, 6th rank, or diagonals.
- King moves: g7 can go to h8, g8, f8, h7, f7, h6, g6.

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black king is on c5, not on the edge, so not stalemated.
- No immediate stalemate risk, but must avoid boxing in the king without giving him a move.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **Qe5**: Queen to e5, cutting off the king from d5 and e5 squares, but allows Kc4.
2. **Qf5**: Queen to f5, similar effect.
3. **Qe6**: Queen to e6, but doesn't restrict the king much.
4. **Qf4**: Queen to f4, controls the 4th rank, but king can go to d5.
5. **Qe7**: Queen to e7, controls 7th rank, but not optimal.
6. **Qf3**: Queen to f3, controls 3rd rank, but not optimal.
7. **King moves:** Kg7-h8, g8, f8, h7, f7, h6, g6. None of these are forcing.

**Best plan:**  
The standard technique is to use the queen and king to box in the enemy king, driving him to the edge, then to a corner, and deliver mate.

**Current position:**  
- If we play Qf5, the Black king is forced to move to d4 or b4.
- If we play Qe5, Black king can go to b4 or c4.
- If we play Qf4, Black king can go to d4 or b4.

But, let's check if we can cut off more squares.

**Move Qf5:**  
- Black king on c5.
- Qf5 controls f5, e5, d5, c5, b5, a5, f6, f7, f8, f4, f3, f2, f1.
- Black king can go to d4, b4, b5, d5, c4, b6, d6, c6. But with Qf5, c5 is covered, so king can go to d4, b4, c4.

**Move Qe5:**  
- Queen on e5 controls e5, d5, c5, b5, a5, f6, g7, h8, e6, e7, e8, e4, e3, e2, e1.
- Black king can go to d4, b4, c4.

So, both Qf5 and Qe5 restrict the king similarly.

**Move Qf4:**  
- Queen on f4 controls f4, e4, d4, c4, b4, a4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f3, f2, f1.
- Black king can go to d5, b5, c6, d6, b6, c4.

But Qf4 allows more squares.

**What about a king move?**  
- Kg7-h8: No effect.
- Kg7-f7: Brings king closer to the action.

But queen moves are more forcing.

**Is there a checkmate in one?**  
- Qf5, Qe5, Qf4, Qe4, Qg6, Qg5, Qg4, Qh6, Qh5, Qh4, Qf3, Qe3, Qd6, Qd4, Qc3, Qb2, Qa1, etc.

No checkmate in one.

**What about Qf5?**  
After Qf5, Black king has to move to d4, b4, or c4.

**What about Qe5?**  
After Qe5, Black king has to move to d4, b4, or c4.

**What about Qf4?**  
After Qf4, Black king can go to d5, b5, c6, d6, b6, c4.

So Qf5 or Qe5 is best.

**Which is better, Qf5 or Qe5?**  
Let's check Qf5:

1. Qf5 Kd4
2. Kg7 (move king closer)  
But Black can keep running.

But let's check Qe5:

1. Qe5 Kc4 (or Kb4, Kd4)
2. Kg7

But in both cases, the king is not being forced to the edge yet.

**What about Qf3?**  
Queen on f3 controls the 3rd rank, but Black king can go to d4, b4, c4.

**What about Qg5?**  
Queen on g5 controls g5, f5, e5, d5, c5, b5, a5, h6, h7, h8, g6, g7, g8, g4, g3, g2, g1.  
But Black king can go to d4, b4, c4.

So, Qf5 or Qe5 is best.

**What about a waiting move with the king?**  
If we play Kg7-f7, we bring the king closer, but it's not as forcing.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to play Qf5, keeping the Black king boxed in and preparing to bring the king closer for mate.

**Final move:**

2025-06-11 21:45:02,401 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 7.14s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6K1/8/5Q2/1k6/8/8/8 w - - 27 122

- White: King on g7, Queen on f5
- Black: King on b4

**Material:** White has a queen and king, Black has only a king.

**Objective:** Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Key points:**
- The Black king is on b4, near the edge.
- White's king is far away, but the queen can restrict the Black king.
- Avoid stalemating the Black king (i.e., do not cut off all escape squares unless it's checkmate).

**Candidate moves:**
1. f5f4+ (Queen to f4, check)
   - Black king must move to a3 or b3.
2. f5e4 (Queen to e4, no check, but restricts Black king)
3. f5d5 (Queen to d5, restricts Black king)
4. f5f6 (Queen to f6, no check, but keeps options open)
5. f5f8 (Queen to f8, no check, but not as forcing)

**Let's check f5f4+:**
- 1. Qf4+ Kc5 (only move)
- Then Qe4 (cutting off more squares)
- The king is being pushed to the edge.

But let's check if there's a faster way.

**What about f5e4+?**
- 1. Qe4+ Kc5 (only move)
- 2. Qd5+ Kb4 (only move)
- 3. Qd4+ Kb3 (only move)
- 4. Kf6 (bring king closer, but Black can keep running)

But f5f4+ seems to be the most forcing.

**What about f5d5?**
- 1. Qd5 Kc3 (only move)
- 2. Qe4 Kb3 (only move)
- 3. Kf6 (again, king approaches, but not as forcing)

**What about f5f6?**
- 1. Qf6 Kc4 (only move)
- 2. Qe5 Kb4 (only move)
- 3. Qd5 Kc3 (only move)
- 4. Qe4 Kb3 (only move)

So, **f5f4+** is the most forcing move, pushing the Black king to the edge and closer to mate.

**Check for stalemate:**
- After f5f4+, Black has legal moves, so no stalemate.

**Final move:**
```
f5f4
```

2025-06-11 21:45:13,092 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 9.01s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6K1/8/2k5/5Q2/8/8/8 w - - 29 123  
**White:** King on g7, Queen on f4  
**Black:** King on c5

It's White to move. Black's king is on c5, and White's king is on g7, queen on f4. Black has no pieces left.

**Objective:** Checkmate the Black king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Legal moves:**  
- King moves: g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7f7, g7h6, g7g6, g7f6  
- Queen moves: f4f8, f4b8, f4f7, f4c7, f4h6, f4f6, f4d6, f4g5, f4f5, f4e5, f4h4, f4g4, f4e4, f4d4, f4c4, f4b4, f4a4, f4g3, f4f3, f4e3, f4h2, f4f2, f4d2, f4f1, f4c1

**Analysis:**

The Black king is on c5, not on the edge, so we need to restrict its movement and drive it to the edge/corner for a forced mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe5+** (f4e5): Forces the king to move. Let's see where the king can go:
   - c5 to b6, b4, d4, d6, or c4.
   - But after Qe5+, the king can go to b6, b4, d4, d6, or c4.

2. **Qf6**: Cuts off the sixth rank, but doesn't check. King can move.

3. **Qf5**: Cuts off the fifth rank, but doesn't check.

4. **Qd6+**: f4d6. This checks the king. Let's see where the king can go:
   - c5 to b6, b4, d4, c4.

5. **Qb4+**: f4b4. This checks the king. King can go to c6, d5, d4.

6. **Qf8**: f4f8. Cuts off the 8th rank, but doesn't check.

**Best move:**

We want to keep the king restricted and drive it to the edge. Checking with Qe5+ or Qd6+ is good, but let's see which one is more forcing.

- **Qe5+**: King can go to b6, b4, d4, d6, c4.
- **Qd6+**: King can go to b6, b4, d4, c4.

So Qd6+ removes d6 as an escape square, slightly more restrictive.

**After Qd6+:**
- If Kb4, then Qd4+ is mate.
- If Kc4, then Qd4+ is mate.
- If Kd4, then Qd4+ is mate.
- If Kb6, then Qb4+.

Wait, let's check:

1. Qd6+  
   - Kb5: Not possible, occupied by queen.
   - Kb4: Qd4# (mate)
   - Kc4: Qd4# (mate)
   - Kd4: Qd4# (mate)
   - Kb6: Qb4+ (then Kc6, Qb6#)

So Qd6+ is a forcing move that leads to mate next move unless Kb6, in which case Qb4+ and then Qb6#.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
f4d6
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/6K1/3Q4/1k6/8/8/8/8 w - - 31 124

- White: King on g7, Queen on d6
- Black: King on b5

White to move.

**Material:** White has a queen and king, Black only has a king. This is a basic queen vs king endgame. The goal is to checkmate Black as efficiently as possible, while avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate threats:** 
- The Black king is on b5, which is close to the edge. The White king is on g7, far away, but the queen can restrict the Black king.

**Candidate moves:**
- The queen can cut off the Black king further, or deliver checks to force the king to the edge/corner.
- Avoid stalemating the Black king (i.e., don't put the queen where the Black king has no legal moves and is not in check).

Let's look at some candidate moves:

1. **d6d4+**: Check, forces the king to a4 or c6.
   - If Kc6, then Qd5+ forces Kb6, then Qc5+ forces Ka6, then Qb6# is mate.
   - If Ka4, then Qc4+ forces Ka5, then Qb5# is mate.

2. **d6d5+**: Check, king can go to a4, a6, or c6.
   - Similar to above, but d4+ is more forcing.

3. **d6e5**: No check, just restricts the king.

4. **d6d7**: No check, restricts king.

But **d6d4+** looks like the most forcing move, as it checks and restricts the king's options.

Let's check for stalemate after d6d4+:
- If Kc6, Black has c5, b5, b6, a6 squares, so not stalemate.
- If Ka4, Black has a5, b4 squares, so not stalemate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d6d4
```

2025-06-11 21:45:28,381 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.42s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King on g7, Queen on d4  
- Black: King on a6

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black's king is on a6, boxed in by its own pieces and the edge of the board.
- White's queen and king are very active and can coordinate to deliver mate.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **Qd4-a1+**: Forces the Black king to b5 (only move).
2. **Qd4-c4+**: Forces the Black king to b7 (only move).
3. **Qd4-d6+**: Forces the Black king to b5 (only move).
4. **Qd4-d8**: Not a check, but could be preparing to cut off the king.
5. **Qd4-b2**: Not a check, but could be preparing to cut off the king.

But let's look for forced mates.

**Check all checks:**

- **Qd4-a1+**: King must go to b5.
    - Then Qb1+ forces Ka4, then Qb4# is mate.

- **Qd4-c4+**: King must go to b7.
    - Then Qb5+ Ka8, Qb7# is mate.

- **Qd4-d6+**: King must go to b5.
    - Then Qb4+ Ka6, Qb6# is mate.

Let's check the fastest mate:

1. Qd4-c4+ Ka7 (only move)
2. Qc4-b5 Ka8 (only move)
3. Qb7#

Or

1. Qd4-a1+ Kb5
2. Qb1+ Ka4
3. Qb4#

Or

1. Qd4-d6+ Ka5
2. Qb4+ Ka6
3. Qb6#

All are mate in 3.

But **Qd4-c4+** is the cleanest, as it keeps the king on the edge and doesn't allow any escape.

**Final move:**
```
d4c4

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

For example:
```

You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-11 21:45:35,957 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 6.22s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- White: King on g7, Queen on c4  
- Black: King on b7

**White to move.**

**Immediate threats and goals:**  
- The Black king is on b7, with no pawns or pieces to defend it.
- White's queen and king are well-coordinated.
- The Black king is on the edge of the board, so a mating net is possible.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qc4-c8+ (forces the king to a7 or b6)
2. Qc4-d5+ (forces the king to a6 or b8)
3. Qc4-b5+ (forces the king to a7 or c8)
4. Qc4-f7+ (forces the king to a8 or c8)
5. Kg7-f6 (brings the king closer, but not urgent)
6. Kg7-h8 (king move, but not urgent)

Let's check the most forcing moves: checks.

**1. Qc4-c8+**
- If ...Ka7, then Qc8-c7+ Kb8 Qc7-b7# (mate)
- If ...Ka6, not possible, as king is on b7.
- If ...Kb6, then Qc8-c6+ Ka7 Qc6-b6# (mate)

**2. Qc4-d5+**
- If ...Ka6, then Qd5-b5# (mate)
- If ...Kb8, then Qd5-b7# (mate)

**3. Qc4-b5+**
- If ...Ka7, then Qb5-b7# (mate)
- If ...Kc8, not possible, as king is on b7.

**Let's check Qc4-d5+ in detail:**
- ...Kb8 Qd5-b7# (mate)
- ...Ka6 Qd5-b5# (mate)

**So Qd5+ is mate in one or two.**

**But Qd5+ is mate in one if Kb8, and mate in one if Ka6.**

**So Qd5+ is a forced mate in one, as the king cannot escape.**

**Final move:**
```
c4d5

2025-06-11 21:45:42,353 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 5.01s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2k5/6K1/8/3Q4/8/8/8/8 w - - 37 127  
White: King on g7, Queen on d5  
Black: King on c8

It's White's move.

**Immediate tactical check:**  
- White's queen is very close to the black king, and the white king is cutting off the escape squares on the 7th and 8th ranks.
- The black king is on c8, with no pawns or pieces left.
- The queen and king can coordinate for a forced mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qd7# (Checkmate)
2. Qc6+ (Check)
3. Qe6+ (Check)
4. Qf5+ (Check)
5. Qg8+ (Check)
6. Qf3 (Quiet move)
7. Kg6 (King move)

But let's check if any of these are mate:

- **Qd7#**: The queen moves to d7, covering c7, d8, e7, and d6. The king on c8 cannot move to b8, b7, c7, d7, d8, or b8. All squares are covered by the queen or the white king. This is checkmate.

**Double-check:**
- Black king on c8.
- Qd7 covers: d7 (itself), c7, d8, e7, d6.
- White king on g7 covers f8, f7, g8, h8, h7.
- No black pieces to block or capture.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is the immediate checkmate:

```
d5d7

2025-06-11 21:45:48,272 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1) (took 4.57s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1k6/3Q2K1/8/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 39 128  
White: King on g7, Queen on d7  
Black: King on b8

**White to move.**

**Material:**  
White is up a queen and has a king very close to the black king. Black has only the king left.

**Objective:**  
Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**  
- d7d8: Queen to d8, but this is not check and does not threaten mate.
- d7e8: Queen to e8, not check.
- d7d6: Queen to d6, not check.
- d7d5: Queen to d5, not check.
- d7b7: Queen to b7, not check.
- d7c7: Queen to c7, not check.
- d7a7: Queen to a7, not check.
- d7f7: Queen to f7, not check.
- d7g7: Queen to g7, not check.
- d7h7: Queen to h7, not check.
- d7e7: Queen to e7, not check.
- d7c8: Queen to c8, this is check.

Let's check the move d7c8:

1. Qc8+ Ka7 (only move)
2. Qb7# (checkmate)

So, Qc8+ forces the king to a7, and then Qb7 is mate.

**Double-check for stalemate:**  
After Qc8+, Black king is on a7, and after Qb7, it's checkmate. No stalemate risk.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
d7c8
```
