2025-06-11 14:19:01,333 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.53s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position:**  
- White has played 1.e4, occupying the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop.
- Black to move. All pieces are on their original squares.

**Strategic Considerations:**  
- The most popular and solid responses to 1.e4 are 1...c5 (Sicilian Defense), 1...e5 (Open Game/Double King's Pawn), 1...e6 (French Defense), 1...c6 (Caro-Kann Defense).
- Each has its own strategic ideas:
    - **1...c5**: Asymmetrical, fighting for the center, dynamic play.
    - **1...e5**: Symmetrical, classical, leads to open games.
    - **1...e6**: Solid, prepares d5, but can be passive.
    - **1...c6**: Solid, prepares d5, less theoretical than e5/c5.

**Short-term tactics:**  
- No immediate threats from White.
- No tactical tricks available for Black.

**Long-term strategy:**  
- As Black, it's important to contest the center and develop pieces efficiently.
- Avoid passive setups that allow White to seize a lasting initiative.

**Candidate Moves:**  
- e7e5: Classical, fights for the center, develops pieces naturally.
- c7c5: Sicilian, leads to dynamic, unbalanced positions.
- e7e6: French, solid but can be passive.
- c7c6: Caro-Kann, solid, less sharp than Sicilian.

**Evaluation:**  
- 1...e5 is the most classical and time-tested response, leading to open games and giving Black equal chances.
- 1...c5 is the most combative, aiming for an unbalanced fight and winning chances.
- 1...e6 and 1...c6 are solid, but slightly less ambitious in terms of immediate central control.

**Considering the urgency and the need to play for a win:**  
- The Sicilian Defense (1...c5) is the most combative and statistically offers Black the best winning chances at all levels. It avoids symmetry and immediately challenges White's central control.

**Final Move:**
```
c7c5

2025-06-11 14:19:58,225 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.84s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p1P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2  
**Move history:** 1. e4 c5 2. e5

**White's last move:** e4-e5  
**Black to move.**

**Position assessment:**
- White has advanced the e-pawn to e5, gaining space and attacking Black's c5 pawn indirectly (by threatening d2-d4 in the future).
- Black's c5 pawn is not immediately attacked, but White is grabbing space and preparing to develop pieces actively.
- Black must decide how to develop and contest the center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d7-d6**: The most principled response, immediately challenging White's center and preparing to develop the knight to c6. This is standard in many Sicilian lines, especially when White pushes e5 early.
2. **b8-c6**: Develops a piece, attacks the e5 pawn, but allows d4 by White, gaining more space.
3. **g8-f6**: Develops a knight, attacks e4/e5, but White can push e5-e6, gaining more space and possibly cramping Black.
4. **e7-e6**: Prepares to challenge the center with d5, but blocks in the dark-squared bishop.
5. **c5-c4**: Gains space on the queenside, but doesn't contest the center and allows White to play d4 with tempo.
6. **d7-d5**: Immediate central challenge, but after exd6, Black must recapture with the queen or bishop, which can be awkward.

**Deeper analysis:**

- **d7-d6** is the most solid and flexible. After exd6, Black can recapture with the queen or bishop. If White doesn't capture, Black can play Nc6, g6, Bg7, and develop normally.
- **b8-c6** allows White to play d4, and after cxd4, Nf3, Black's center is under pressure.
- **g8-f6** allows e5-e6, which can be annoying for Black.
- **e7-e6** is solid but passive.
- **d7-d5** is risky; after exd6, Qxd6, White can develop with tempo.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is **d7-d6**. It directly challenges White's center, prepares to develop the knight to c6, and keeps all options open. This is the most principled and safest response, minimizing White's chances for an early initiative.

**Final move:**
```

**Move history:** 1. e4 c5 2. e4e5 d7d6 3. e5e6

**White's last move:** e5-e6, attacking the d7 pawn and threatening to disrupt Black's pawn structure.

**Key points:**
- White's pawn on e6 is advanced and threatens to capture on f7, forking king and rook if Black castles kingside.
- Black's d6 pawn is attacked, but not immediately threatened.
- Black can capture the pawn with f7xe6, but this opens the f-file and gives White a lead in development.
- Other moves like developing a knight (Nf6 or Nh6) or bishop (Be6, Bd7) are possible, but do not address the threat of e6xf7+.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f7xe6**: Recaptures the pawn, but opens the f-file and gives White a target. However, not capturing allows White to play exf7+.
2. **Nf6**: Develops a piece, but allows e6xf7+ Kxf7, and White can develop with tempo.
3. **d5**: Counterattacks in the center, but White can still play exf7+.
4. **Be6**: Blocks the pawn, but White can play d4, and Black's bishop is awkward.

**Analysis:**

- If Black does not capture on e6, White will play exf7+ next move, forking king and rook, forcing Black's king to move and lose castling rights.
- Therefore, **f7xe6** is forced to avoid losing material and castling rights.

**Drawbacks:**  
- Opens the f-file, but Black remains solid and can develop pieces.
- White has a slight lead in development, but Black is not worse.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to capture the pawn with f7xe6.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp2p1pp/3pp3/2p5/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4  
**Move history:** 1.e2e4 c7c5 2.e4e5 d7d6 3.e5e6 f7e6 4.d2d4

**Current position:**
- White has advanced the d-pawn to d4, and Black has captured on e6 with the f-pawn.
- Black's center is solid but slightly passive.
- White has more space, but Black is not under immediate threat.
- Black to move.

**Legal moves:**
- Knight development: g8f6, b8c6, b8d7
- Bishop development: c8d7
- Queen moves: d8d7, d8c7, d8b6, d8a5
- Pawn moves: e6e5, d6d5, c5d4, c5c4, b7b6, b7b5, a7a6, a7a5, h7h6, h7h5, g7g6, g7g5
- King moves: e8f7, e8d7

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8f6** (develops a knight, attacks d4, prepares to castle)
2. **b8c6** (develops a knight, attacks d4, supports c5)
3. **e6e5** (solidifies the center, but blocks the bishop)
4. **d6d5** (strikes at the center, but after dxc5, White gets a passed pawn)
5. **c5d4** (captures, but after Qxd4, White's queen is active)
6. **c5c4** (gains space, but White can play b3 or Nf3)
7. **c8d7** (develops bishop, but passive)
8. **d8a5+** (checks, but White can block easily)

**Analysis:**

- **g8f6** is the most natural move, developing a piece, attacking d4, and preparing to castle.
- **b8c6** is also good, but g8f6 is more flexible and keeps options open.
- **e6e5** is solid, but blocks the light-square bishop and doesn't develop a piece.
- **d6d5** is risky, as White can capture and get a strong pawn.
- **c5d4** gives White a lead in development after Qxd4.
- **c5c4** is playable, but White can easily challenge it.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to develop the kingside knight to f6, attacking the d4 pawn, preparing to castle, and keeping central tension.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkb1r/pp2p1pp/3ppn2/2pP4/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5

**Move history:** 1. e4 c5 2. e4e5 d7d6 3. e5e6 f7e6 4. d2d4 g8f6 5. d4d5

**Position assessment:**
- White has advanced pawns on d5 and e6, cramping Black's position.
- Black's e6 pawn is backward and could be a target.
- White is ahead in space and has a lead in development.
- Black's king is still in the center, and development is lagging.
- White threatens to play c4, attacking the d5 pawn and further increasing space.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6xd5**: Recaptures the pawn, opening the e-file and freeing the position. However, after c4, White can pressure d5.
2. **e6e5**: Advances the pawn, but White can play Nc3, and Black's center is still under pressure.
3. **b8d7**: Develops a piece, but doesn't address the central tension.
4. **g7g6**: Prepares to fianchetto, but is slow.
5. **d8a5+**: Check, but White can block easily with Nc3.
6. **f6d5**: Knight takes pawn, but after Qxd5, Black loses the right to castle and is behind in development.

**Deeper analysis:**
- **e6xd5** is the most principled move. It opens the center, develops the queen, and contests White's space advantage. After exd5, White can play Nc3, but Black can continue with Be7 and castle kingside. The position is still cramped, but at least Black is not losing material and can try to catch up in development.

- **e6e5** leaves the d6 pawn backward and doesn't solve the space problem.

- **b8d7** is too passive.

- **d8a5+** is not dangerous; White can block easily.

**Tactical check:**
- After exd5, if White plays Nc3, Black can play Be7, and after Nf3, Black can castle. The position is playable.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture on d5 and open the position, aiming to catch up in development and relieve central pressure.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 14:24:01,753 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.74s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkb1r/pp2p1pp/3p1n2/2pQ4/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 6  
**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Both sides have all pieces except White is missing the e-pawn and Black is missing the d-pawn.
- White has a strong queen on d5, exerting pressure and central control.
- Black's development is behind; queenside pieces are undeveloped.
- King safety: Both kings are uncastled, but Black's king is more exposed due to the open center and lack of development.

**Immediate threats:**
- White's queen is centralized and could threaten Qxb7 or Qe6+ in some lines.
- Black's knight on f6 is attacked by the queen.
- Black's d8 queen is attacked by nothing, but is somewhat awkwardly placed.
- White's development is also behind, but the queen is very active.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe7** is not possible.
2. **Qd7**: Offers a queen trade, which would relieve pressure, but after Qxd7+ Nbxd7, White has a slight lead in development.
3. **Qb6**: Attacks b2 and puts pressure on the queenside, but allows Qe6+.
4. **Qa5+**: Checks, but White can block with Bd2, gaining a tempo.
5. **Nc6**: Not possible, as the knight is on b8 and c6 is occupied by the queen.
6. **Nxd5**: Not possible, as the knight is on f6 and d5 is occupied by the queen.
7. **Be6**: Not possible, as the bishop is on c8 and e6 is occupied.
8. **Nbd7**: Develops a piece, but does not address the queen's centralization.
9. **Be7**: Not possible, as the bishop is on c8 and e7 is occupied.
10. **e6**: Not possible, as e6 is occupied.

**Key tactical considerations:**
- If Black plays Qd7, White can trade queens, which is probably best for Black to relieve pressure.
- If Black plays Qb6, White can play Qe6+, forcing Black's king to move or block with Be7, which loses a piece.
- If Black plays Qa5+, White can play Bd2, and Black has to retreat or trade queens.
- If Black plays Nbd7, White can play Qe6, threatening mate on f7 and attacking the rook on a8.
- If Black plays Nf6-d7, White can play Qe6, again threatening mate and attacking the rook.

**Best move:**
- Trading queens with Qd7 seems to be the safest way to relieve pressure. After Qxd7+ Nbxd7, Black can develop the bishop and castle queenside, equalizing the game.

**Final move:**
```
d8d7

2025-06-11 14:25:13,685 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.14s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb1kbQr/pp1qp1pp/3p1n2/2p5/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 7

**White's last move:** Qg8 (White's queen is on g8, attacking Black's king on e8 and rook on f8)

**Material:**
- Black is down a rook and a pawn for a queen (White has sacrificed a lot to get the queen on g8).
- Black's king is on e8, rook on h8, knight on f6, bishop on f8, queen on d7.
- White's queen is on g8, threatening Qxf8# (mate in one).

**Threats:**
- White is threatening Qxf8#, which is checkmate.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. h8g8 (Rook to g8, capturing the queen)
2. f6g8 (Knight to g8, capturing the queen)
3. e8d8 (King moves, but Qxf8# is still mate)
4. d7d8 (Queen blocks, but Qxf8# is still mate)
5. f8g8 (Bishop to g8, capturing the queen)

But let's check which pieces can capture the queen on g8:
- Rook h8 can go to g8
- Knight f6 can go to g8
- Bishop f8 can go to g8

**Which is best?**

- **h8g8:** Rook captures queen. After Rxg8, Black loses the exchange (rook for queen), but at least avoids mate.
- **f6g8:** Knight captures queen. After Nxg8, Black keeps the rook, but the knight is now on g8, and White can try to develop and attack.
- **f8g8:** Bishop captures queen. After Bxg8, Black keeps both rooks, but loses the bishop pair.

**Which piece should capture the queen?**

- **Material:** Queen is worth more than any of the capturing pieces.
- **Piece activity:** The rook on h8 is not very active, but the knight on f6 is a good defender. The bishop on f8 is undeveloped.

**If Rxg8:** White has no immediate threats, and Black can try to consolidate.
**If Nxg8:** Black keeps the rook, but the knight is awkwardly placed.
**If Bxg8:** Black keeps both rooks, but loses the bishop pair.

**Best move:** The best is to capture with the rook, as it develops the rook to an open file and avoids awkward piece placement. The rook is less valuable than the queen, and Black keeps the knight and bishop for defense.

**Final move:**
```
h8g8

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnb1kbr1/pp1qp1pp/3p1n2/2p5/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQq - 1 8

**Move history:**
1. e2e4 c7c5 
2. e4e5 d7d6 
3. e5e6 f7e6 
4. d2d4 g8f6 
5. d4d5 e6d5 
6. d1d5 d8d7 
7. d5g8 h8g8 
8. f1c4

**Current position:**
- White has developed the bishop to c4, eyeing the f7 square.
- Black's king is still on e8, unable to castle kingside (rook moved), but queenside castling is possible.
- Black is down a pawn, but has the bishop pair and a solid center.
- White's pieces are more active, but Black is not in immediate danger.

**Key candidate moves:**
1. **b8c6**: Develops a piece, attacks the bishop on c4, and prepares to castle queenside.
2. **d7g4**: Queen move, attacks the bishop on c4 and g2 pawn, but exposes the queen.
3. **d7e6**: Queen move, centralizes the queen, but blocks the bishop.
4. **e8d8**: King move, prepares to connect the rooks, but is passive.
5. **g7g6**: Prepares to fianchetto the bishop, but is slow.
6. **d6d5**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play Bb5+.

**Deep analysis:**

- **b8c6** is the most natural move, developing a piece, attacking the bishop, and preparing to castle queenside. If White plays Nc3, Black can continue with d5, gaining space and tempo.
- **d7g4** is risky; after f3, the queen is forced to move again, losing time.
- **d7e6** is passive and blocks the bishop.
- **e8d8** is unnecessary at this stage.
- **d6d5** is premature; after Bb5+, Black's king is stuck in the center.

**Tactical considerations:**
- White's bishop on c4 is active, but after b8c6, it must decide whether to retreat or exchange.
- Black needs to catch up in development and prepare to castle queenside.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to develop the knight to c6, attacking the bishop and preparing to castle queenside.

**Final move:**
```
b8c6

2025-06-11 14:27:09,188 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.82s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b1kbB1/pp1qp1pp/2np1n2/2p5/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQq - 0 9

**White's last move:** Bxg8

**Material count:**
- Black: Rooks x2, Bishops x1, Knights x2, Queen x1, Pawns x7
- White: Rooks x2, Bishops x2, Knights x2, Queen x1, Pawns x7

But White has just captured on g8, so Black's rook on h8 is gone. Black is down the exchange (rook for bishop).

**Immediate threats:**
- White's bishop on g8 is very active, attacking f7 and threatening to retreat with tempo.
- Black's king is on e8, unable to castle.
- White is ahead in development and has a dangerous initiative.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d7e6** (Qe6): Defends the bishop on g8, but White can play Bxe6, Qxe6, Nc3, and Black is still under pressure.
2. **d7g4** (Qg4): Attacks g2, but White can play Bd5, and Black is still underdeveloped.
3. **f6g8** (Nf6xg8): Recaptures the bishop, but then White can play Nc3, and Black is still behind in development.
4. **e8d8** (Kd8): Moves the king, but doesn't solve the problems.
5. **c6e5** (Nc6-e5): Attacks the queen, but the queen is not on the board.
6. **d7e6** (Qe6): Offers a queen trade, but White can avoid it.

**Best move:**
- The most urgent problem is the bishop on g8. If we recapture with the knight (Nf6xg8), we at least regain the piece and can try to consolidate. Other moves leave us down material or under attack.

**Tactical check:**
- After Nf6xg8, White can play Nc3, developing and threatening to bring more pieces into the attack, but Black can try to play Nf6, Be7, and castle queenside if possible.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to recapture the bishop and try to consolidate.

2025-06-11 14:27:46,569 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.10s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b1kbn1/pp1qp1pp/2np4/2p5/8/8/PPPK1PPP/RNB3NR b q - 1 10

**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight, 6 pawns
- White: 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight, 7 pawns

**Key features:**
- Black is up a queen for a bishop (White's queen was captured on g8).
- White's king is on d2, uncastled and exposed.
- Black's king is on e8, also uncastled but less exposed.
- White's pieces are not well coordinated; Black has a huge material advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d7g4**: Queen to g4, threatening mate on d1 and attacking g2.
2. **d7f5**: Queen to f5, eyeing c2 and f2, but not as forcing.
3. **d7e6**: Queen to e6, centralizing and possibly threatening Qe1+.
4. **c6d4**: Knight to d4, attacking c2 and possibly threatening Nxc2+.
5. **d6d5**: Pawn to d5, opening lines and freeing the c8 bishop.
6. **g8h6**: Knight to h6, not very relevant.
7. **e8d8**: King to d8, connecting rooks.

**Tactical ideas:**
- White's king is exposed on d2.
- Black's queen can invade via g4 or e6.
- Black can consider Nxc2+ if the opportunity arises.

**Calculation:**

Let's check **d7g4**:
- 10... Qg4 attacks g2 and threatens Qxg2, but White can play g3.
- After 11. g3, Black can play Qe4, threatening Qe1#.
- White can block with Nc3, but then Black can play Qxh1.

Let's check **c6d4**:
- 10... Nd4 attacks c2 and threatens Nxc2+.
- If White plays Nc3, then Black can play Qf5 or Qg4, but it's less forcing.

Let's check **d7e6**:
- 10... Qe6 threatens Qe1#.
- White can block with Nc3, but then Black can play Qh6+ and pick up the h2 pawn.

But **d7g4** seems the most forcing, as it immediately threatens mate and attacks g2.

**Line after 10... Qg4:**
- 11. g3 Qe4 (threatening Qe1#)
- 12. Nc3 Qxh1

Black wins a rook and maintains a huge material advantage.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
d7g4
```

2025-06-11 14:28:39,709 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 14:28:46,970 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight, 6 pawns
- White: Rook, knight, 7 pawns, king (White is missing a queen and a bishop, but has an extra pawn)

**Position:**
- White's king is on e3, somewhat exposed.
- Black's queen is on g4, eyeing e4, g2, and possibly h3.
- Black's knight on c6 is well-placed, can jump to d4 or e5.
- Black's bishop on c8 is undeveloped.
- White's rook is on a1, knight on b1, bishop on c1, all undeveloped.
- Black has a big material advantage (queen vs rook and knight).

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's queen is very active.
- White's king is exposed.
- Black can consider moves like ...Qxg2, but White can respond with Qf3+ or similar, so calculation is needed.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Qxg2 (grabbing a pawn, but is it safe? After Nf3, queen must move, but then Rg1 traps the queen. So this is a trap.)
2. ...Qe6+ (check, but White can block with Ne2 or Kd2, not decisive)
3. ...Nd4 (centralizing, attacks c2, e2, and f3, and threatens ...Nxc2+)
4. ...g5 (protects queen, but slow)
5. ...Nf6 (retreats, but not necessary)
6. ...Be6 (develops, but not urgent)
7. ...Qxg2 is a blunder due to Rg1 trapping the queen after Nf3.

**Critical calculation:**
- ...Nd4 is very strong: threatens ...Nxc2+ (forking king and rook), and if c3, then ...Nf5+ wins the queen or mates.
- After ...Nd4, if White plays Na3 (to defend c2), then ...Qxg2 is possible, as the knight is not on f3 to trap the queen.

**Let's check ...Nd4:**
- 11...Nd4
    - 12. Na3 (defends c2)
        - 12...Qxg2 (now safe)
    - 12. Nf3 (attacks queen)
        - 12...Nxf3 (removes defender)
    - 12. c3 (blocks)
        - 12...Nf5+ (forks king and queen)
    - 12. Kd3 (king moves)
        - 12...Bf5+ (develops with tempo)

**Conclusion:**
- ...Nd4 is a powerful move, threatening ...Nxc2+ and ...Nf5+.
- It develops a piece with tempo and increases pressure on White's exposed king.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 14:29:42,047 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.32s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b1kbn1/pp2p1pp/3p4/2p5/3n2q1/3K4/PPP2PPP/RNB3NR b q - 5 12

- Black to move.
- White's king is on d3, exposed.
- Black's queen is on g4, eyeing the kingside and center.
- Black's knight is on d4, very active.
- Black's king is on e8, still in the center but not under immediate threat.
- White's pieces are mostly undeveloped, with the rook on a1, knight on b1, bishop on c1, and rook on h1.
- Black has a significant lead in development and White's king is very exposed.

**Immediate tactical ideas:**
- The White king is on d3, and the queen on g4 is very close.
- The knight on d4 controls many escape squares.
- Possible checks: ...Qd1+, ...Qe2+, ...Qf5+, ...Qxg2.
- ...Qd1+ forces White to block with the knight (Nb1-d2), but then ...Bf5+ is possible.
- ...Qxg2 is a free pawn, but let's see if there's something more forcing.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Qd1+ (forcing, king can't move, only block with knight)
2. ...Qxg2 (grabbing a pawn, but less forcing)
3. ...Bf5+ (not check yet, but after ...Qd1+ and Nd2, then ...Bf5+ is strong)
4. ...Qf5+ (direct check, but White can block with e4)
5. ...Qe2+ (forces White to block with knight or bishop, but then ...Bf5+ is coming)

Let's calculate ...Qd1+:

1. ...Qd1+
    - Only move is Nd2 (otherwise mate or huge material loss)
2. ...Bf5+ (now threatening mate)
    - White must block with Ne4 (otherwise Kc4 runs into ...b5# or ...Be6#)
    - After ...Bf5+ Ne4, ...Qe2+ is possible, but let's see if there's a forced mate.

Alternatively, after ...Qd1+ Nd2, ...Qe2+:
- White can block with Kc3, but then ...Nb5# is mate.

Let's check this line:
1. ...Qd1+
2. Nd2 (forced)
3. ...Qe2+ (king can't go to c3 because of Nb5#)
    - If Kc3, ...Nb5# is checkmate.

So, after ...Qd1+ Nd2 Qe2+ Kc3 Nb5# is checkmate.

**Conclusion:**  
The move ...Qd1+ leads to a forced mate in a few moves.

**Final move:**
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b1kbn1/pp2p1pp/3p4/2p5/2Kn4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBq2NR b q - 7 13

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (d1), Bishop (c8), Knight (d4), King (e8), Rooks (a8), pawns (a7, b7, c5, d6, e7, g7, h7)
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (b1), King (c4), pawns (a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2)

**Immediate tactical threats:**
- Black's queen is on d1, deep in White's territory, but not under attack.
- White's king is on c4, very exposed.
- Black's knight on d4 is centralized and powerful.
- Black's bishop on c8 is undeveloped.
- Black's king is on e8, not yet castled, but not under immediate threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxc2+** (d1xc2): Immediate check, forcing White's king to move. After Kd5, Black can continue to harass the king.
2. **Be6+** (c8e6): Develops with tempo, checking the king. White must respond, possibly with Kd3 or Kd5.
3. **Nxc2** (d4xc2): Captures a pawn, but doesn't check.
4. **Qh5** (d1h5): Threatens mate on d5, but White can defend.
5. **Qd4+** (d1d4): Check, but White can block with Kb3 or Kb5.

**Deep analysis:**

- **Qxc2+**: After Kd5, Black can play Be6+ (c8e6), and White's king is forced to move again. If Kxe6, then Nxe6 is not possible because the king is on e6. If Kb5, then Bd7+ is possible. This line keeps the king exposed and allows Black to develop with tempo.
- **Be6+**: If Kd3, then Qxc2+ wins another pawn and keeps up the attack. If Kd5, then Qd4# is mate (since the king can't go to b5, b3, c3, or e6, all are covered).

**Critical tactical point:**
- After **Be6+**, if Kd5, then Qd4# is checkmate.

**Let's check this:**
- 1... Be6+ 2. Kd5 Qd4# (the king is mated: c3, b3, b5, e6 all covered)
- 1... Be6+ 2. Kd3 Qxc2+ (winning another pawn and keeping up the attack)

**Therefore, the best move is:**

```
c8e6
```

2025-06-11 14:30:00,745 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (d1), Bishop (e6), Knight (d4), Rooks (a8), King (e8), pawns (a7, b7, c5, d6, g7, h7)
- White: Rook (a1), Bishop (c1), Knight (g1), King (c3), pawns (a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is on e8, but White has no immediate threats.
- White's king is on c3, exposed and vulnerable.

**Threats:**
- Black's queen is very active on d1.
- Black's knight on d4 is centralized and powerful.
- White's pieces are undeveloped and king is exposed.

**Tactical Motifs:**
- Black can consider checks, captures, and threats to White's king.
- The move ...Qxc2+ is possible, attacking the king and threatening mate ideas.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qxc2+**: Immediate check, forces White's king to b4 or a3.
2. **Nb5+**: Not possible, no knight on b5.
3. **Qa4+**: Not possible, queen is on d1.
4. **Qe1+**: Not possible, queen is on d1.
5. **Qd2+**: Not possible, queen is on d1.
6. **Qe2**: Not possible, queen is on d1.

**Let's calculate Qxc2+:**
- 14...Qxc2+ 15. Kb4 (forced)
- Now, Black can play ...a5+ (pawn to a5), which is a check.
- If 16. Ka3, then ...Nb5# is mate.
- If 16. Kxa5, then ...b6# is mate.

So, **Qxc2+** is a forced sequence leading to checkmate.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
d1c2
