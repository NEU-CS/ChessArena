2025-07-14 16:02:40,049 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.11s):
Let me analyze the position and consider the best move for White.

Current position analysis:
1. The FEN shows the starting position (standard initial setup)
2. White has all pieces developed except the knights and bishop on c1
3. Black has not made any moves yet
4. It's White's turn to move (move 1)

Candidate moves to consider:
1. Knight moves (g1h3, g1f3, b1c3, b1a3):
   - g1f3 develops the knight to a natural square, attacking e5
   - b1c3 also develops the knight, but less aggressively
   - g1h3 is less common but possible
   - b1a3 is less optimal as it moves away from the center

2. Pawn moves:
   - e2e4 is the most natural, opening the center and controlling d5
   - d2d4 is also possible, but e4 is more standard
   - Other pawn moves are less ambitious

3. Other developing moves:
   - f2f4 is possible but premature (weakens e4)
   - c2c4 is possible but less common in this position

Best options seem to be between:
- g1f3 (developing knight with tempo on e5)
- e2e4 (claiming center space)

Between these, e2e4 is more principled in the opening, fighting for central control and preparing to develop the bishop. It's the most common move in this position for good reason.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e2e4
```

2025-07-14 16:03:26,104 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 2.39s):
Let's analyze the position:

1. e4 e6

This is the start of a Pirc Defense. Black has played a solid, flexible opening, preparing to develop the bishop to e7 or c5 and possibly castle kingside. White has a wide range of options here.

Candidate moves:
- d4: The main line, challenging the center and opening lines for the bishop and queen.
- Nf3: Developing a knight, supporting e4 and preparing for kingside castling.
- Nc3: Developing a knight, supporting d5 and e4.
- Bc4/Bb5: Developing a bishop, eyeing f7 or pinning the knight (if developed).
- d3/c4: More restrained, but less ambitious than d4.

Analysis:
- d4 is the most principled move, striking in the center and opening lines for development. After exd4, White can recapture with the knight or pawn, gaining central control.
- Nf3 is also good, but d4 is more direct and challenging.
- Bc4 is playable, but d4 is more urgent to claim the center.

Tactical considerations:
- No immediate tactics for either side.
- d4 is safe and leads to a standard, open game.

Conclusion: The best move is to strike in the center with d4.

```
d2d4

2025-07-14 16:04:38,684 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.94s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 f6

- Black has played a somewhat passive setup, with ...f6 and ...e6, which can lead to a King's Indian or a French-like structure.
- White has a strong center with pawns on e4 and d4.
- Black's kingside is slightly weakened by ...f6.
- White to move.

Candidate moves:
1. e4-e5: Gains space, attacks the knight on f6, and can lead to a strong initiative. If ...Nd5, then exf6 Nxf6, and White has a lead in development and space.
2. Nf3: Develops a piece, supports the center, and prepares for kingside castling.
3. Nc3: Develops a piece, supports d4, and prepares for queenside castling.
4. Bc4: Develops a piece, eyes f7, and can put pressure on Black's kingside.
5. d4-d5: Gains space, but can be met by ...exd5, and after exd5, Black can play ...Nc6 and ...Be7, with a solid position.

Deeper analysis:
- e5 is very strong here. If ...Nd5, then exf6 Nxf6, White has a lead in development and space. If ...Nc6, then exf6 Nxf6, again White has a lead.
- Nf3 is solid, but e5 is more ambitious and takes advantage of Black's setup.
- Bc4 is good, but e5 is more direct and forces Black to react.

Tactical check:
- After e5, if ...Nd5, then exf6 Nxf6, White can play Nf3, and Black's king is still in the center.
- If ...Nc6, then exf6 Nxf6, and White can play Nf3, again with a lead.

Conclusion:
The best move is to play e5, gaining space and initiative, and putting pressure on Black's setup.

My move:
```

2025-07-14 16:05:59,436 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.66s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 f6 3.e5 fxe5 4.Bc5

- White to move.
- Black has played a somewhat passive setup, with ...f6 and ...e6, and the bishop on c5 is active.
- White has a strong center with pawns on d4 and e5.
- Black's king is still in the center, and development is lagging.
- White has a lead in development and can aim for a quick initiative.

Candidate moves:
1. d4c5: Captures the bishop, but after ...bxc5, Black gets some central control and opens the b-file.
2. d4d5: Pushes the pawn, gaining space and cramping Black's position. If ...exd5, then exd6+ is a strong sacrifice, opening the e-file and attacking the king.
3. Nf3: Develops a piece, attacks the e5 pawn, and prepares to castle.
4. Bb5+: Checks, but Black can block easily with ...Bd7 or ...Nc6.
5. Qh5: Threatens mate on f7, but Black can defend with ...g6.
6. Nc3: Develops a piece, supports d4, and prepares to bring out the bishop.

Deep analysis:

- d4d5: If ...exd5, then exd6+ Qxd6, Qxd5, White is up a piece and has a strong attack. If ...exd5, White can also play Nf3, attacking the e5 pawn and preparing to castle.
- Nf3: Solid, but not as aggressive as d4d5.
- Bb5+: Not very effective.
- Qh5: Threatens mate, but Black can defend.

Best move:
- d4d5 is the most aggressive and principled move, gaining space and opening lines for attack. It also threatens to open the e-file with exd6+.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
d4d5
```

2025-07-14 16:06:59,637 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.87s):
Let's analyze the position:

Position after 4...Bb4:
- White: King on e1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1/h1, Bishops on c1/f1, Knights on b1/g1, pawns on a2/b2/c2/d5/e5/f2/g2/h2
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8/h8, Bishops on b4/c8, Knights on b8/g8, pawns on a7/b7/c7/d7/e6/f6/g7/h7

White to move. Legal moves: e1e2, d1d2, c1d2, b1c3, b1d2, c2c3

Analysis:
- Black's last move was ...Bb4, pinning the knight on b1 (if it were on b1), but currently, the knight is on b1, so it's not pinned yet.
- White's center is strong with pawns on e5 and d5.
- Black's queenside is undeveloped, and the bishop on b4 is a bit loose.
- White's king is safe, and there are no immediate threats.
- White should develop pieces and maintain the center.

Candidate moves:
1. c2c3: Attacks the bishop on b4, forcing it to move. If ...Bxc3, then dxc3, and White has a strong center and open d-file.
2. b1c3: Develops a knight, attacks the bishop on b4, and supports the center.
3. c1d2: Develops a bishop, but doesn't challenge Black's bishop on b4.
4. d1d2: Queen move, but not necessary yet.
5. e1e2: King move, unnecessary.
6. b1d2: Knight move, but c3 is more active.

Best move:
- c2c3 is the most principled, attacking the bishop and gaining space. If Black exchanges, White recaptures and keeps a strong center.

Final move:
```
c2c3
```

2025-07-14 16:08:20,999 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.05s):
Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material: At the moment, the material is equal. Both sides have all their major and minor pieces intact.
- Center Control: White has a strong presence in the center with pawns on d5 and e5. Black's pawn structure in the center is a bit disrupted with the pawn on f6.
- Piece Activity: White's pieces are generally well - placed to start an attack. The pawn on e5 restricts some of Black's pieces, especially the light - squared bishop on b4.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. e5f6:
    - This move captures a pawn and opens up the diagonal for the light - squared bishop on f1. It also further disrupts Black's pawn structure. After this move, Black will have to deal with the open f - file and the potential for a pawn storm on the kingside.
2. d5e6:
    - This move also captures a pawn and opens up the diagonal for the dark - squared bishop on c8. However, it may leave the d - file open for Black's rooks and doesn't have the same immediate impact on the kingside as e5f6.
3. c3b4:
    - This move captures the bishop on b4. While it gains a piece, it also allows Black to recapture with the pawn on a6, which will open up the a - file for Black's rooks and potentially give Black some counter - play on the queenside.

 Final Decision
The move e5f6 seems to be the best option as it maximizes White's advantage in the center and has a strong impact on Black's kingside pawn structure.

```
e5f6

2025-07-14 16:09:07,508 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.56s):
Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: At present, the material is equal. Both sides have all their major and minor pieces intact, and the pawn structure is relatively balanced, except for the advanced pawn on f6.
- Piece Activity: White has an advanced pawn on f6 which is putting pressure on Black's position. Black's bishop on a5 is somewhat out of play as it is blocked by its own pawns. White's pieces are generally more centralized and have more mobility.
- King Safety: Both kings are in their starting positions, but White has the option to castle kingside to get the king to a safer square and connect the rooks.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. f6g7: This move captures the pawn on g7 and opens up the diagonal for the white bishop on c1. It also further disrupts Black's pawn structure. After this move, Black will have to deal with the new pawn on g7 and the potential threats it poses.
2. d5e6: This move advances the pawn further and attacks Black's pawn on e6. It also controls more central squares. However, it may expose the pawn to potential attacks from Black's pieces.
3. f6f7: This move promotes the pawn to a queen or other piece. But it may be premature as it leaves the pawn on f7 vulnerable to attacks from Black's pieces, and Black can easily capture it with the knight or bishop.
4. d5d6: This move advances the pawn and attacks Black's pawn on d6. It also controls more central squares. But similar to d5e6, it may expose the pawn to potential attacks.

 Final Move Selection
The move f6g7 seems to be the best option. It captures a pawn, opens up the diagonal for the bishop, and further disrupts Black's pawn structure. It also puts more pressure on Black's position and forces Black to make a move to deal with the new pawn on g7.

2025-07-14 16:09:42,962 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.41s):
Let's analyze the position and the legal moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material: We have a pawn on g7 that is about to promote. This is a huge advantage as it can potentially change the balance of the game significantly.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, while the black king is still in the center and may be vulnerable to attacks.
- Piece Activity: Our pieces are mostly still in their starting positions, except for the pawns that have advanced. We need to quickly activate our pieces to support the promotion of the g7 pawn and put pressure on the black king.

 Candidate Moves Analysis
1. Promotion Moves (g7h8q, g7h8r, g7h8b, g7h8n):
    - Promoting the pawn is a very strong option. A queen promotion (g7h8q) gives us the most firepower. It can immediately start attacking black's pieces and put pressure on the black king. A rook promotion (g7h8r) is also a good option as it can control files and ranks. A bishop or knight promotion may have more specific tactical purposes, but in this position, a queen seems more likely to be the best choice.
2. Other Moves:
    - Moves like g1h3, g1f3, etc. are mainly for piece development. But without promoting the g7 pawn first, we are not taking full advantage of our current position. These moves may give black more time to consolidate their position and defend against our promotion threat.

 Conclusion
Promoting the g7 pawn to a queen (g7h8q) is the best move as it gives us the most immediate and powerful threat. It can start attacking black's pieces and put pressure on the black king right away.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material: We have a queen on h8, which is a very powerful piece. Our opponent has a rook, a knight, and a bishop, but their king is still in the center and vulnerable.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe in the starting position, while the black king is still in the center and has not castled yet.
- Piece Activity: Our queen on h8 is well - placed to attack, and we have the opportunity to use our other pieces to support an attack.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. h8g8: This move brings the queen to a more central position on the g - file. It attacks the black knight on f7 and also puts pressure on the black king's position. It also helps in coordinating our pieces better.
2. h8h7: This move keeps the queen on the h - file. It attacks the black pawn on h6 and also threatens to capture the black knight on f7 if it moves. However, it may not be as effective in terms of central control as h8g8.
3. h8g7: This move attacks the black knight on f7 directly. But it may expose the queen to potential counter - attacks from black's pieces.
4. h8h6: This move captures the black pawn on h6. While it gains a pawn, it may not be the best move as it moves the queen away from a more central and attacking position.
5. h8f6: This move attacks the black knight on e7 and also puts pressure on the black king's position. But it may not be as effective as h8g8 in terms of overall coordination.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material: We have a queen on g8, which is a very powerful piece. Our opponent has a rook, a knight, and a bishop, but their king is exposed on e7. We have a significant material advantage, so we should try to press for a checkmate.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe in the starting position, while the black king is in the center and vulnerable to attacks from our pieces.
- Piece Activity: Our queen on g8 has a wide range of possible moves and can attack multiple squares around the black king. Our other pieces are mostly still in their starting positions and need to be developed to join the attack.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. g8h8: This move takes the queen to the h - file. It can potentially attack the h6 pawn and put pressure on the black king's position. However, it doesn't directly threaten the black king and may not be the most efficient way to use the queen's power.
2. g8f8: This move brings the queen to the f - file. It can attack the f7 square and put pressure on the black king. But similar to g8h8, it doesn't immediately create a strong threat to the black king.
3. g8e8: This move places the queen on the e - file. It directly attacks the black king on e7. This is a very strong move as it puts the black king in check and forces a response. It also coordinates well with our other pieces, as the black king is now in a very precarious position.
4. g8d8: This move takes the queen to the d - file. It can attack the d6 square and put pressure on the black position. But it doesn't directly threaten the black king and may not be as effective as g8e8.
5. g8h7: This move attacks the h6 pawn, but it doesn't directly target the black king and may not be the best use of the queen's power in this position.
6. g8g7: This move attacks the g6 square, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king and may not be as effective as g8e8.
7. g8f7: This move attacks the f7 square, but it doesn't directly target the black king and may not be the most efficient way to press for a checkmate.
8. g8g6: This move attacks the g6 square, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king and may not be as effective as g8e8.
9. g8e6: This move attacks the e6 square, but it doesn't directly target the black king and may not be the best way to press for a checkmate.
10. g8g5: This move attacks the g5 square, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king and may not be as effective as g8e8.
11. g8g4: This move attacks the g4 square, but it doesn't directly target the black king and may not be the best use of the queen's power.
12. g8g3: This move attacks the g3 square, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king and may not be as effective as g8e8.

2025-07-14 16:10:47,828 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.68s):
Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: At present, the material is relatively even. Both sides have all their major and minor pieces intact, and the pawn structure is still developing.
- Piece Activity: White has a passed pawn on d5 which can be a powerful asset if advanced. Black's pieces are a bit cramped, especially with the pawn on e6 blocking some of the bishop's mobility.
- King Safety: Both kings are relatively safe for now, but White should be careful not to expose the king in the center.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. d5e6:
    - This move advances the passed pawn and attacks the black pawn on e6. It also opens up the diagonal for the white bishop on f1. However, it might expose the pawn to potential attacks from black pieces like the knight or the queen.
2. d5d6:
    - This move also advances the passed pawn, but it doesn't attack any immediate black pieces. It might be a bit more passive compared to d5e6 as it doesn't create any immediate threats.
3. g1h3:
    - This move develops the knight to a more active square. It can potentially attack the black pawn on h6 in the future. But it doesn't directly deal with the passed pawn situation.
4. f1c4:
    - This move develops the bishop to an active diagonal, attacking the black pawn on e6. It also helps in controlling the center. However, it doesn't advance the passed pawn.

 Final Decision
The move d5e6 seems to be the best option. It advances the passed pawn, which is a key asset for White. It also opens up the diagonal for the bishop on f1, allowing it to put pressure on Black's position. By attacking the e6 pawn, it forces Black to make a decision about how to defend it, which can potentially lead to weaknesses in Black's position.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: At present, the material is relatively even. However, we need to consider the activity of the pieces and the pawn structure.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, but we need to be careful as the opponent's pieces are actively placed.
- Pawn Structure: We have a passed pawn on e6 which can be a powerful weapon if we can support it and advance it.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. g1h3: This move develops the knight to a more active square. It attacks the opponent's pawn on h6 and also helps in controlling the center. But it doesn't directly deal with the passed pawn on e6.
2. d1d6: This move captures the opponent's pawn on d6. It immediately gains a pawn and also opens up the d - file for our rook. It also helps in supporting the passed pawn on e6.
3. c1h6: This move develops the bishop and attacks the opponent's pawn on h6. But it doesn't have a direct impact on the passed pawn on e6.

 Final Decision
The move d1d6 seems to be the best option. It captures a pawn, opens up the d - file, and supports the passed pawn on e6. This move gives us a material advantage and also helps in advancing our passed pawn, which is a key factor in this position.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material: We have a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The opponent has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. So, in terms of material, we are relatively even.
- Piece Activity: Our queen on d6 is well - placed, attacking the opponent's king and various other pieces. The opponent's king is a bit exposed on f6. Our other pieces are mostly still in their starting positions, lacking full development.
- Pawn Structure: Our pawn on e6 is advanced and can potentially cause trouble for the opponent. The opponent's pawns on the queenside are a bit loose, and the pawn on h6 is a potential target.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. d6f8: This move captures the opponent's rook on f8. It immediately gains a material advantage. After this move, our queen will be in a very active position, threatening the opponent's king and other pieces.
2. d6d8: This move also attacks the opponent's rook on d8. However, it doesn't gain as much control over the board as d6f8. The queen on d8 will be more exposed to counter - attacks.
3. d6b8: This move captures the opponent's rook on b8. But it moves the queen to the edge of the board, reducing its mobility and potential threats.
4. d6e7: This move attacks the opponent's king and the pawn on e7. But it doesn't gain any material advantage and may expose our queen to counter - attacks.
5. Other non - attacking moves: Moves like g1h3, g1f3, etc., are mainly for piece development. But at this stage, we should focus on capitalizing on our current attacking position.

 Conclusion
The best move is d6f8 as it immediately gains a material advantage and keeps our queen in an active position.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material: We have a queen and a pawn for a rook and a bishop. So, we have a significant material advantage.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe in the starting position, while the black king is a bit exposed in the center.
- Piece Activity: Our queen is well - placed on f8, putting pressure on the black position. Our other pieces are mostly still in their starting positions, lacking activity.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. f8h8: This move takes the queen to the h - file. It attacks the black pawn on h7 and also puts pressure on the black king's position. However, it moves the queen away from the center and may not be the most efficient way to use our material advantage.
2. f8g8: This move also moves the queen to a new file. It attacks the black pawn on g7 and can potentially create threats against the black king. But similar to f8h8, it moves the queen away from the center.
3. f8e8: This move keeps the queen on the e - file. It attacks the black pawn on e5 and can also put pressure on the black king. But it doesn't change the queen's position significantly.
4. f8g7: This move attacks the black pawn on h7 and also puts pressure on the black king. It is a more aggressive move, bringing the queen closer to the black king.
5. f8f7: This move attacks the black pawn on f7 and can also put pressure on the black king. It is a relatively safe move, keeping the queen on the f - file.
6. f8e7: This move attacks the black pawn on e5 and can also put pressure on the black king. It is a more central move, keeping the queen in a strong position.
7. f8h6: This move attacks the black pawn on h7 and also puts pressure on the black king. It is a more aggressive move, bringing the queen closer to the black king.
8. f8f6: This move attacks the black pawn on f7 and can also put pressure on the black king. It is a relatively safe move, keeping the queen on the f - file.
9. f8d6: This move attacks the black pawn on c5 and can also put pressure on the black king. It is a more central move, keeping the queen in a strong position.
10. f8f5: This move attacks the black pawn on f7 and can also put pressure on the black king. It is a relatively safe move, keeping the queen on the f - file.
11. f8c5: This move attacks the black pawn on b4 and can also put pressure on the black king. It is a more central move, keeping the queen in a strong position.
12. f8f4: This move attacks the black pawn on f7 and can also put pressure on the black king. It is a relatively safe move, keeping the queen on the f - file.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material: We have a queen and a pawn for a rook and a bishop. So, we have a material advantage.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, while the black king is a bit exposed in the center.
- Piece Activity: Our queen is well - placed on g7, putting pressure on the black king. Our other pieces are mostly still on their starting squares, lacking activity.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. g7h8: This move promotes the queen to a new queen, which doesn't really change the situation. It doesn't put more pressure on the black king or improve the position of our other pieces.
2. g7g8: Similar to g7h8, it just changes the position of the queen without a significant impact on the game.
3. g7f8: This move takes the queen to a square where it can potentially attack the black rook on a8. However, it moves the queen away from the black king, reducing the immediate pressure on the king.
4. g7h7: This move keeps the queen on the seventh rank, but it doesn't really change the dynamics of the position. It doesn't attack any important black pieces or put more pressure on the king.
5. g7f7: This move brings the queen closer to the black king, but it also blocks the path of our other pieces, such as the bishop on c1.
6. g7e7: This move puts the queen on a square where it can attack the black king and also control some important central squares. It also opens up the possibility of using our other pieces, such as the bishop on c1.
7. g7d7: This move takes the queen to a square where it can attack the black bishop on b5, but it moves the queen away from the black king.
8. g7c7: This move is similar to g7d7, moving the queen away from the king and attacking a less - important black piece.
9. g7b7: This move is also moving the queen away from the king and doesn't seem to have a clear purpose.
10. g7h6: This move attacks the black pawn on h6, but it doesn't put more pressure on the black king.
11. g7g6: This move attacks the black pawn on g6, but it doesn't change the overall pressure on the black king significantly.
12. g7f6: This move brings the queen closer to the black king, but it also allows the black king to potentially escape to e5.
13. g7g5: This move attacks the black pawn on g5, but it doesn't put more pressure on the black king.
14. g7e5: This move puts the queen on a square where it can attack the black king and also control some important central squares. It also opens up the possibility of using our other pieces.
15. g7g4: This move attacks the black pawn on g4, but it doesn't change the overall pressure on the black king significantly.
16. g7d4: This move takes the queen to a square where it can attack the black pawn on d4, but it moves the queen away from the black king.
17. g7g3: This move attacks the black pawn on g3, but it doesn't put more pressure on the black king.

2025-07-14 16:16:28,677 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.68s):
Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: At present, the material is relatively even. Both sides have a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and pawns. However, the position of the pieces and pawns is crucial.
- King Safety: White's king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, while Black's king is a bit exposed in the center.
- Pawn Structure: White has a passed pawn on e6, which can be a powerful asset if advanced. Black's pawns on the queenside are a bit loose and can be targeted.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. e6e7:
    - Advantages: This move advances the passed pawn, putting pressure on Black's position. It threatens to promote the pawn and forces Black to deal with this threat. If Black captures the pawn with the queen (Qxe7), White can gain a tempo by attacking the queen with other pieces.
    - Disadvantages: It exposes the pawn to potential attacks from Black's pieces, especially the bishop on a5 and the knight on b8.
2. g1h3:
    - Advantages: Develops the knight to a more active square, potentially attacking Black's pawns on the kingside.
    - Disadvantages: It doesn't directly address the passed pawn on e6, which could be a missed opportunity to put more pressure on Black.
3. f1c4:
    - Advantages: Develops the bishop to an active diagonal, potentially targeting Black's king and pawns.
    - Disadvantages: It doesn't deal with the immediate threat of advancing the passed pawn on e6.

 Final Decision
The move e6e7 seems to be the best option. It capitalizes on White's passed pawn, which is a significant asset in this position. By advancing the pawn, White forces Black to respond to the threat of promotion, which can lead to tactical opportunities for White.

2025-07-14 16:18:48,186 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 9.74s):
Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: At present, the material seems relatively even. However, we need to consider the activity of the pieces and the pawn structure.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, but we need to be careful as the opponent's pieces are actively placed.
- Piece Activity: The opponent's knight on c6 and bishop on a5 are well - placed to put pressure on our position. Our pieces need to coordinate better to launch an attack or defend effectively.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. g1h3: This move develops the knight to a more active square. It attacks the opponent's pawn on h5 and also helps in controlling the center. It also prepares for potential attacks on the opponent's king side.
2. g1f3: Similar to g1h3, it develops the knight. It controls important central squares and can potentially support an attack on the opponent's king.
3. g1e2: This move is less aggressive compared to the previous two. It mainly serves to defend the king and may not contribute much to an attack.
4. f1a6: This move attacks the opponent's bishop on a5. However, it moves the bishop far from the center and may leave it vulnerable to counter - attacks.
5. f1b5: It attacks the opponent's knight on c6. But it also exposes the bishop to potential counter - attacks and may not lead to a significant advantage.
6. f1c4: This move develops the bishop to an active square. It attacks the opponent's pawn on e6 and also helps in controlling the center. It can also support an attack on the opponent's king.
7. f1d3: It develops the bishop, but it is not as active as f1c4. It may not put as much pressure on the opponent's position.
8. f1e2: Similar to g1e2, it is a more defensive move and may not contribute much to an attack.
9. e1e2: This move is mainly for king safety. It moves the king to a more protected square, but it is a passive move.
10. e1d2: It moves the king to a different square, but it may expose the king to potential threats from the opponent's pieces.
11. e1d1: Similar to e1d2, it is a move that may not contribute to an attack and may expose the king.
12. c1h6: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on h5. But it moves the bishop far from the center and may leave it vulnerable to counter - attacks.
13. c1g5: It attacks the opponent's pawn on h5 and also helps in controlling the king side. It can potentially support an attack on the opponent's king.
14. c1f4: This move develops the bishop to an active square. It attacks the opponent's pawn on e5 and also helps in controlling the center.
15. c1e3: It develops the bishop, but it is not as active as c1f4. It may not put as much pressure on the opponent's position.
16. c1d2: This move is mainly for bishop safety and may not contribute much to an attack.
17. b1a3: This move develops the knight to a less active square. It may not put as much pressure on the opponent's position.
18. b1d2: It develops the knight, but it is not as active as some of the other knight moves.
19. h2h3: This move is mainly a pawn move to protect the knight on g1. It is a passive move.
20. g2g3: It is a pawn move that may help in protecting the knight on f1, but it is a passive move.
21. f2f3: This move weakens the pawn structure in front of our king and may expose the king to potential threats.
22. b2b3: It is a pawn move that may help in protecting the knight on c1, but it is a passive move.
23. a2a3: This is a simple pawn move that may not contribute much to an attack or defense.
24. h2h4: This move is more aggressive compared to h2h3. It attacks the opponent's pawn on h5 and can potentially open up lines for our pieces.
25. g2g4: It is a pawn move that may help in attacking the opponent's pawn on h5, but it also weakens the pawn structure in front of our king.
26. f2f4: This move weakens the pawn structure in front of our king and may expose the king to potential threats.
27. b2b4: It is a pawn move that may help in attacking the opponent's pawn on c5, but it also weakens the pawn structure in front of our king.
28. a2a4: This is a simple pawn move that may not contribute much to an attack or defense.

 Final Move Selection
After careful analysis, the move `g1h3` seems to be the best option. It develops the knight to an active square, attacks the opponent's pawn on h5, and helps in controlling the center. It also prepares for potential attacks on the opponent's king side.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: At present, the material seems relatively even. However, we need to consider the activity of the pieces and the potential threats.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, but we need to be careful as the opponent's pieces are actively placed.
- Piece Activity: Our knights and bishops have potential to become more active, and we need to find ways to coordinate them to put pressure on the opponent.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. h3g5: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on g5. It also brings the knight closer to the opponent's king. However, it might expose the knight to potential counter - attacks from the opponent's pieces.
2. h3f4: This move also activates the knight, but it doesn't directly target the opponent's king or create an immediate threat. It might be useful for long - term control of the center, but it doesn't seem to be the most aggressive option.
3. h3g1: This move takes the knight back to a less active square. It doesn't contribute to our short - term or long - term goals of putting pressure on the opponent.
4. h1g1: Moving the rook to g1 doesn't seem to have an immediate impact on the game. It doesn't attack any of the opponent's pieces or create a strong threat.
5. f1a6: This move attacks the opponent's bishop on a6. But it moves the bishop far from the center and might not be the most effective way to put pressure on the opponent's king.
6. f1b5: This move attacks the opponent's knight on b4. It also helps in controlling the center. However, it doesn't directly target the opponent's king.
7. f1c4: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on c4 and also helps in controlling the center. But it doesn't create an immediate threat to the opponent's king.
8. f1d3: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on d3. It also helps in controlling the center. But it doesn't directly target the opponent's king.
9. f1e2: This move doesn't seem to have an immediate impact on the game. It doesn't attack any of the opponent's pieces or create a strong threat.
10. e1e2: Moving the king to e2 doesn't seem to be a good idea as it doesn't contribute to our attacking or defensive goals.
11. e1d2: Similar to e1e2, moving the king to d2 doesn't contribute to our short - term or long - term goals.
12. e1d1: Moving the king to d1 doesn't seem to be a good idea as it doesn't contribute to our attacking or defensive goals.
13. c1h6: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on h6. It also brings the bishop closer to the opponent's king. However, it might expose the bishop to potential counter - attacks.
14. c1g5: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on g5. It also brings the bishop closer to the opponent's king. But it might expose the bishop to potential counter - attacks.
15. c1f4: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on f4. It also helps in controlling the center. But it doesn't directly target the opponent's king.
16. c1e3: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on e3. It also helps in controlling the center. But it doesn't directly target the opponent's king.
17. c1d2: This move doesn't seem to have an immediate impact on the game. It doesn't attack any of the opponent's pieces or create a strong threat.
18. b1a3: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on a3. It also helps in controlling the center. But it doesn't directly target the opponent's king.
19. b1d2: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on d2. It also helps in controlling the center. But it doesn't directly target the opponent's king.
20. c3b4: This move captures the opponent's knight on b4. It also helps in controlling the center. But it doesn't directly target the opponent's king.
21. c3c4: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on c4. It also helps in controlling the center. But it doesn't directly target the opponent's king.
22. g2g3: This move is a pawn move that doesn't have an immediate impact on the game. It doesn't attack any of the opponent's pieces or create a strong threat.
23. f2f3: This move is a pawn move that doesn't have an immediate impact on the game. It doesn't attack any of the opponent's pieces or create a strong threat.
24. b2b3: This move is a pawn move that doesn't have an immediate impact on the game. It doesn't attack any of the opponent's pieces or create a strong threat.
25. a2a3: This move is a pawn move that doesn't have an immediate impact on the game. It doesn't attack any of the opponent's pieces or create a strong threat.
26. g2g4: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on g5. It also helps in opening up the position for our pieces. It can potentially put pressure on the opponent's king.
27. f2f4: This move attacks the opponent's pawn on e5. It also helps in opening up the position for our pieces. It can potentially put pressure on the opponent's king.
28. a2a4: This move is a pawn move that doesn't have an immediate impact on the game. It doesn't attack any of the opponent's pieces or create a strong threat.

 Final Move Selection
The move g2g4 seems to be the best move. It attacks the opponent's pawn on g5, which is a key pawn in the opponent's position. It also helps in opening up the position for our pieces, especially the bishop on c1 and the knight on h3. It can potentially put pressure on the opponent's king and force the opponent to make defensive moves.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: We have a pawn on the verge of promotion on e7. Promoting this pawn will give us a significant material advantage. The opponent has a rook, a bishop, and a knight, but our promoted piece can potentially outweigh their combined forces.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, while the opponent's king is a bit exposed in the center.
- Piece Activity: Our pieces are well - placed to support the pawn promotion and to put pressure on the opponent's king.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. Promotion Moves (e7e8q, e7e8r, e7e8b, e7e8n):
    - Promoting the pawn is a very strong move. A queen promotion (e7e8q) gives us the most powerful piece on the board. It can immediately start attacking the opponent's king and other pieces. A rook promotion (e7e8r) is also a good option as it can control important files and ranks. A bishop or knight promotion might be less common in this situation as they are not as powerful as a queen or rook in this position.
2. Other Moves:
    - Moves like h3g5, h3f4, etc., are mainly about re - positioning the knight on h3. But these moves do not address the immediate opportunity of promoting the pawn on e7.
    - Moves like f1a6, f1b5, etc., are about moving the bishop on f1. These moves are not as urgent as promoting the pawn.
    - Moves like c1h6, c1g5, etc., are about moving the bishop on c1. Similar to the above, they do not take advantage of the current opportunity.

 Conclusion
The best move is to promote the pawn on e7 to a queen. This gives us a powerful piece that can start attacking the opponent's king and other pieces immediately.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: We have a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and pawns. The opponent has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and pawns. So, in terms of major pieces, we are up a bishop.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, while the opponent's king is a bit exposed on f7.
- Piece Activity: Our queen on e8 is well - placed, threatening various squares on the board. Our knights and bishops have potential to be activated. The opponent's pieces are a bit scattered, and their king is vulnerable.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. e8h8: This move takes the queen to the h - file. It attacks the h7 pawn and also puts pressure on the opponent's king side. However, it moves the queen away from the center and may limit its long - range influence.
2. e8g8: Similar to e8h8, it moves the queen to the g - file. It attacks the g7 pawn and also threatens the opponent's king side. But again, it moves the queen away from the center.
3. e8f8: This move keeps the queen on the back rank and attacks the f7 square where the opponent's king is located. It also controls important central squares.
4. e8d8: This move moves the queen to the d - file. It attacks the d6 pawn and also controls some central squares. But it may not be as effective in terms of attacking the opponent's king.
5. e8c8: This move moves the queen to the c - file. It attacks the c7 pawn and may not have a significant impact on the opponent's king.
6. e8f7: This move captures the opponent's queen. It is a very tempting move as it gives us a material advantage. After this capture, we will be up a queen for a knight.
7. e8e7: This move keeps the queen on the e - file and attacks the f7 square. But it doesn't gain any material immediately.
8. e8d7: This move moves the queen to the d - file and attacks the d6 pawn. But it doesn't have a strong attacking potential on the opponent's king.
9. e8e6: This move keeps the queen on the e - file and attacks the f7 square. But it doesn't gain any material immediately.
10. e8c6: This move moves the queen to the c - file and attacks the c7 pawn. But it doesn't have a strong attacking potential on the opponent's king.
11. e8e5: This move keeps the queen on the e - file and attacks the f7 square. But it doesn't gain any material immediately.

19. h3g1: This move moves the knight to the g1 square. It doesn't have a significant impact on the current position.
20. h1g1: This move moves the rook to the g - file. It doesn't have a strong attacking potential on the opponent's king.

Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material: We have a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and pawns. Our opponent has a rook, two bishops, a knight, and pawns. We have a significant material advantage with our extra queen.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, while the black king is a bit exposed in the center.
- Piece Activity: Our pieces are well - placed to launch an attack. The queen on f7 is in a very aggressive position, threatening multiple squares around the black king.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. f7g8: This move promotes the queen to a new queen (which is redundant) and doesn't really change the situation on the board. It doesn't put more pressure on the black king or improve our position significantly.
2. f7f8: Similar to f7g8, it just moves the queen to a different square on the back - rank without creating any immediate threats or improving our position.
3. f7e8: This move takes the queen to a square where it can potentially attack the black knight on b4, but it also moves the queen away from the immediate vicinity of the black king. It doesn't seem to be the most effective way to use our material advantage.
4. f7h7: This move attacks the black pawn on h6, but it doesn't directly target the black king. It may be a useful move in the long - run to gain more space on the kingside, but it doesn't seem to be the most urgent move at this moment.
5. f7g7: This move attacks the black pawn on g6 and also keeps the queen in a position where it can potentially attack the black king from the side. However, it doesn't directly check the king.
6. f7e7: This move attacks the black pawn on d6 and also keeps the queen in a central position. But it doesn't directly target the black king.
7. f7d7: This move attacks the black pawn on c5 and also puts pressure on the black knight on b4. But it doesn't directly target the black king.
8. f7c7: This move attacks the black pawn on b6 and also puts pressure on the black knight on b4. But it doesn't directly target the black king.
9. f7b7: This move attacks the black pawn on a6 and also puts pressure on the black knight on b4. But it doesn't directly target the black king.
10. f7g6: This move attacks the black pawn on h5 and also keeps the queen in a position where it can potentially attack the black king from the side. But it doesn't directly check the king.
11. f7f6: This move attacks the black pawn on g5 and also keeps the queen in a position where it can potentially attack the black king from the side. But it doesn't directly check the king.

13. f7h5: This move attacks the black pawn on g4 and also keeps the queen in a position where it can potentially attack the black king from the side. But it doesn't directly check the king.
14. f7f5: This move attacks the black pawn on g4 and also keeps the queen in a position where it can potentially attack the black king from the side. But it doesn't directly check the king.
15. f7d5: This move attacks the black pawn on c4 and also puts pressure on the black knight on b4. But it doesn't directly target the black king.
16. f7f4: This move attacks the black pawn on g3 and also keeps the queen in a position where it can potentially attack the black king from the side. But it doesn't directly check the king.
17. f7c4: This move attacks the black pawn on b3 and also puts pressure on the black knight on b4. But it doesn't directly target the black king.
18. f7f3: This move attacks the black pawn on g2 and also keeps the queen in a position where it can potentially attack the black king from the side. But it doesn't directly check the king.
19. f7b3: This move attacks the black pawn on a2 and also puts pressure on the black knight on b4. But it doesn't directly target the black king.
20. h3g5: This move attacks the black pawn on h5 and also brings the knight closer to the black king. But it doesn't directly check the king.
21. h3f4: This move attacks the black pawn on g2 and also brings the knight closer to the black king. But it doesn't directly check the king.

23. h1g1: This move just moves the rook back to a less active square.

2025-07-14 16:25:28,671 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 17.21s):
Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves step - by - step:

 Overall Position Analysis
- Material Balance: We have a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and several pawns. The opponent has a rook, two bishops, and some pawns. We have a significant material advantage with the queen.
- King Safety: Our king is relatively safe behind the pawn wall, while the opponent's king is a bit exposed in the center.
- Piece Activity: Our pieces are well - coordinated. The queen on f7 is in a very aggressive position, threatening multiple squares. The knight on h3 and the bishops can also contribute to an attack.

 Candidate Move Analysis
1. f7g8: This move promotes the queen to a new queen (which is redundant) and doesn't really change the situation on the board. It doesn't put more pressure on the opponent's king or gain any new territory.
2. f7f8: Similar to f7g8, it just moves the queen to a different square on the back - rank without creating any immediate threats.
3. f7e8: This move takes the queen to a square where it can potentially attack the opponent's rook on b8. However, it moves the queen away from the center and might reduce its attacking potential on the opponent's king.
4. f7h7: This move attacks the h - pawn on h6. But it doesn't directly target the opponent's king and might not be the most efficient way to use the queen's power.
5. f7g7: This move attacks the g - pawn on g6. Again, it doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen's attacking potential.
6. f7e7: This move attacks the e - pawn on e6. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the most effective way to press our advantage.
7. f7d7: This move attacks the d - pawn on d6. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen's power.
8. f7c7: This move attacks the c - pawn on c5. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the most efficient way to use the queen.
9. f7b7: This move attacks the b - pawn on b6. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen.
10. f7g6: This move attacks the g - pawn on g6. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the most effective way to press our advantage.
11. f7f6: This move attacks the f - pawn on f6. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen.
12. f7e6: This move attacks the e - pawn on e6. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the most effective way to press our advantage.
13. f7h5: This move attacks the h - pawn on h5. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen.
14. f7f5: This move attacks the f - pawn on f5. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen.
15. f7d5: This move attacks the d - pawn on d5. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the most effective way to press our advantage.
16. f7f4: This move attacks the f - pawn on f4. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen.
17. f7c4: This move attacks the c - pawn on c4. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen.
18. f7f3: This move attacks the f - pawn on f3. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen.
19. f7b3: This move attacks the b - pawn on b3. It doesn't directly target the king and might not be the best use of the queen.
20. h3g5: This move moves the knight to a more central position. It can potentially attack the opponent's king in combination with the queen. It also controls more squares and can put pressure on the opponent's position.
21. h3f4: This move moves the knight to a square where it can attack the opponent's pawn on e6. But it doesn't directly target the king and might not be the most effective way to press our advantage.
22. h3g1: This move moves the knight back to a less active square and doesn't contribute to the attack on the opponent's king.
23. h1g1: This move just moves the rook to a different square on the first rank without creating any immediate threats.
24. f1a6: This move moves the bishop to a square where it can attack the opponent's pawn on b7. But it doesn't directly target the king and might not be the most effective way to press our advantage.
25. f1b5: This move moves the bishop to a square where it can attack the opponent's pawn on c6. But it doesn't directly target the king and might not be the most effective way to press our advantage.
26. f1c4: This move moves the bishop to a square where it can attack the opponent's pawn on d5. But it doesn't directly target the king and might not be the most effective way to press our advantage.
