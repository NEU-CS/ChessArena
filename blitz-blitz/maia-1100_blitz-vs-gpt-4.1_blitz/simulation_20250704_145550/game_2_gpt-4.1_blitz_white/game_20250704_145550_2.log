2025-07-04 14:56:08,692 - INFO - Raw response from White (gpt-4.1_blitz) (took 3.76s):
Let's analyze the position:

This is the starting position of a chess game. As White, I have the first move. The most common and best opening moves are 1.e4 and 1.d4, as they control the center, open lines for the bishops and queen, and lead to a wide variety of well-studied positions.

Candidate moves:
- e2e4: Opens lines for the queen and bishop, controls the center.
- d2d4: Also controls the center and opens lines for the queen and bishop.
- c2c4: English Opening, controls the center but is less direct.
- g1f3: Develops a knight, controls the center, but does not contest the center with a pawn immediately.

Between 1.e4 and 1.d4, both are excellent, but 1.e4 tends to lead to more open games and is statistically slightly more successful at the top level.

Final move:
```
e2e4
```
