2025-06-11 21:19:45,417 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.09s):
Given the initial position (standard starting position), White has several reasonable moves to consider. Let's analyze the most promising candidates:

1. **e2e4** - The classic King's Pawn opening. This move:
   - Controls the center (d5 and f5 squares)
   - Opens lines for the queen and bishop
   - Allows for quick development
   - Leads to open positions which may suit aggressive play

2. **d2d4** - The Queen's Pawn opening. This move:
   - Also controls the center (e5 and c5 squares)
   - Leads to more closed/strategic positions
   - Can transpose into various openings

3. **g1f3** - Developing the knight toward the center. This move:
   - Develops a piece
   - Controls central squares
   - Doesn't commit pawns prematurely

4. **c2c4** - The English Opening. This move:
   - Controls d5
   - Can lead to flexible positions
   - Less direct than e4 or d4

Given the urgency and need for caution while maintaining winning chances, **e2e4** is the most principled move. It:
- Maximizes central control
- Allows for rapid development
- Keeps all options open for future plans
- Has the highest winning percentage statistically in master play
- Creates immediate tension in the position

The other moves are perfectly playable, but e4 offers the most direct path to an advantage while maintaining flexibility.

2025-06-11 21:20:11,462 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.17s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position:**  
This is the starting position after 1.e4.  
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1

**White's plan:**  
White has played 1.e4, controlling the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop. The most common continuations for Black are to contest the center and develop pieces harmoniously.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **e7e5** – The classical response, mirroring White and contesting the center. Leads to open games (Open Game).
2. **c7c5** – The Sicilian Defense, aiming for asymmetry and counterplay.
3. **e7e6** – The French Defense, solid but blocks the c8 bishop.
4. **c7c6** – The Caro-Kann Defense, solid and flexible.
5. **d7d6** – The Pirc/Modern, more flexible but gives White more space.
6. **g8f6** – Alekhine's Defense, attacking the e4 pawn immediately.
7. **d7d5** – The Scandinavian Defense, immediately challenging the center.

**Analysis:**

- **e7e5** is the most classical and direct, leading to well-known, balanced positions. It allows for rapid development and central control.
- **c7c5** (Sicilian) is the most popular at the top level, aiming for an unbalanced game and dynamic counterplay.
- **e7e6** (French) and **c7c6** (Caro-Kann) are solid but slightly passive.
- **d7d5** (Scandinavian) is playable but gives up the center after exd5 Qxd5 Nc3.
- **g8f6** (Alekhine) is provocative and can lead to sharp play, but White can gain space.

**Best move:**  
Given the critical nature of the match and the need for both solidity and winning chances, **c7c5** (the Sicilian Defense) is the best choice. It avoids symmetry, creates immediate tension, and offers Black many opportunities for dynamic play and counterattack. The Sicilian is statistically the most successful defense against 1.e4 at all levels.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 21:20:51,782 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.96s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current position after 1.e4 c5 - this is the Sicilian Defense, one of Black's most aggressive responses to 1.e4.

Key features of the position:
1. White has a central pawn on e4, Black has a pawn on c5 challenging the center
2. All pieces remain on both sides
3. White has multiple developing options

Candidate moves to consider:
1. Nf3 (g1f3) - develops the knight to its most natural square, prepares for kingside castling, and maintains flexibility
2. Nc3 (b1c3) - develops the knight but blocks the c-pawn
3. Bc4 (f1c4) - develops the bishop aggressively but may be premature
4. d4 (d2d4) - immediate central strike, but may lead to simplifications

Deeper analysis:
- Nf3 is the main line in the Sicilian, preparing for standard development with d4, castle kingside, etc.
- Nc3 is playable but less flexible than Nf3
- Bc4 can lead to some traps but isn't theoretically best
- d4 immediately would lead to cxd4 Qxd4 Nc6 with active play for Black

The most principled and flexible move is Nf3, developing a piece while maintaining all options. It's the backbone of most Open Sicilian systems and leads to rich, complex play where White can press for advantage.

Other moves either commit too early or don't develop pieces as effectively. Nf3 also prevents any ...d5 ideas from Black in the near future.

2025-06-11 21:21:19,152 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.71s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2  
**Move history:** 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3

This is the start of the Open Sicilian (after 2. Nf3). As Black, my main priorities are:

- Develop pieces efficiently.
- Control the center.
- Avoid early tactical pitfalls.
- Prepare for ...d7-d5 or ...d7-d6 to support the c5 pawn and open lines for development.

**Candidate moves:**

1. **Nc6 (b8c6):** The main line, develops a piece, controls d4 and e5, supports c5.
2. **d6 (d7d6):** Supports c5, prepares Nf6, but blocks the c8 bishop for now.
3. **e6 (e7e6):** Prepares to develop the dark-squared bishop, but is less common in Open Sicilian.
4. **Nf6 (g8f6):** Develops a piece, attacks e4, but allows e5 with tempo.
5. **Other pawn moves:** Not optimal, as they don't contribute to development or center control.

**Analysis:**

- **Nc6** is the most principled move. It develops a piece, controls the center, and is the main line in the Sicilian Defense. It keeps options open for d6 or e6, and doesn't block the c8 bishop.
- **d6** is also playable, but usually played after Nc6, to avoid blocking the c8 bishop too early.
- **Nf6** can be met by e5, gaining space for White and forcing the knight to move again.

**Tactical considerations:**  
There are no immediate tactics for White. The position is balanced, and Black should stick to mainline development.

**Strategic considerations:**  
Playing Nc6 keeps the most options open and is the most flexible. It is the best move for both short-term and long-term plans.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:

```
b8c6

2025-06-11 21:21:49,994 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.29s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

Current Position:
- It's a Sicilian Defense (Open Variation) after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6
- White has a slight space advantage with the pawn on e4
- Black's knight on c6 is well-placed, controlling d4
- Both sides have yet to develop their bishops

Candidate moves to consider:

1. d2d4 - The most aggressive, aiming to open the center immediately. However, after cxd4 Nxd4 Nxd4 Qxd4, Black gets active play.

2. b1c3 - Developing naturally, but allows Black to play ...d5 with good counterplay.

3. f1b5 - Pin the knight, but after ...a6, we'd have to decide between retreating or exchanging (Bxc6).

4. d2d3 - Solid but somewhat passive.

5. c2c3 - Prepares d4 advance while supporting the center.

After careful consideration:
- f1b5 is the most challenging move, putting immediate pressure on Black's position.
- After likely ...a6, we can retreat to a4 (Bb5-a4) maintaining the pin.
- This develops a piece while creating potential weaknesses in Black's camp.
- It also prevents Black from easily playing ...d5.

The alternatives either allow too much counterplay or are too passive. f1b5 fits best with White's strategic goals in the Open Sicilian.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3

**Move history:** 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5

White has played the Rossolimo Attack against the Sicilian Defense. The bishop on b5 pins the knight on c6, and White is threatening to increase pressure on the center and possibly double Black's pawns if Bxc6 is played.

**Black to move. Let's consider the options:**

### Candidate Moves

1. **g8f6**: Develops a knight, attacks e4, but allows Bxc6, doubling pawns after bxc6.
2. **e7e6**: Solid, prepares d5, opens the bishop, but blocks the c8-bishop for now.
3. **d7d6**: Mainline Sicilian move, supports c5, opens the c8-bishop, but allows Bxc6 bxc6 and d4.
4. **a7a6**: Directly challenges the bishop, asking it to decide (retreat or capture). If Bxc6, then dxc6, keeping the pawn structure more flexible than bxc6.
5. **d8b6** or **d8a5**: Attacks the bishop, but can be met with Nc3, and the queen may be misplaced.
6. **c6d4**: Sacrifices a knight for a pawn, not justified.
7. **c5c4**: Gains space, but loses central control and allows Ne5.
8. **a7a5**: Not really relevant here.

### Deep Analysis

- **a7a6** is the most principled move in the Rossolimo. It asks the bishop to decide. If Bxc6, then dxc6, keeping the pawn structure more flexible, and Black can play ...d5 at some point. If Ba4 or Bxc6, Black is fine.
- **g8f6** is playable, but after Bxc6, bxc6, e5, Nd5, c4, White gets space and Black's queenside pawns are doubled.
- **e7e6** is solid, but White can play Bxc6, dxc6, and d3 or O-O, keeping a small edge.
- **d7d6** is also playable, but again, Bxc6 bxc6, d4, and White has a small edge.

**Theoretical mainline and engine recommendations in this position favor 3...a6.**

### Conclusion

**Best move:** a7a6

This is the most flexible and principled response, directly challenging the bishop and keeping options open.

2025-06-11 21:22:51,362 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.23s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Current Position:
- White has developed Nf3 and Bb5, with pawn on e4. Black has pawns on c5/a6, knight on c6, and undeveloped pieces.
- Black just played a6 attacking the bishop. We need to decide how to handle this.

2. Key Considerations:
- Retreating the bishop (e.g. Bc4, Ba4) maintains the pin on the knight but loses time.
- Capturing the knight (Bxc6) is interesting as it doubles Black's pawns but gives up the bishop pair.
- The position resembles a Rossolimo Variation of the Sicilian.

3. Candidate Moves:
a) Bxc6 - Doubles pawns, opens d-file for White, but gives up bishop pair.
b) Ba4 - Maintains pin, keeps bishop, but may allow b5 later.
c) Bc4 - Centralizes bishop but allows b5 next move.

4. Deep Analysis:
- After Bxc6 dxc6, Black has doubled pawns but gains central control with ...e5 next.
- Ba4 keeps pressure, and if ...b5, we can retreat to b3 maintaining pressure on f7.
- Bc4 allows ...b5 forcing Ba2, which is less active.

5. Best Move:
Ba4 is the most flexible and maintains pressure. It keeps options to castle kingside or queenside, and maintains the pin on the knight. The bishop remains active and can later retreat to b3 if needed.

Here's the move:
```
b5a4

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p1n5/2p5/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4

**Move history:** 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4

**Black to move.**

**Position assessment:**
- White has played the Rossolimo Attack (Bb5), and after a6, retreated the bishop to a4.
- Black has a solid center and the bishop pair.
- No immediate threats from White.
- Black needs to continue development and contest the center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **...b5** (chasing the bishop, gaining space on the queenside)
2. **...e6** (preparing ...d5, solid development)
3. **...Nf6** (developing, attacking e4)
4. **...g6** (preparing Bg7, fianchetto)
5. **...Qa5** (attacking the bishop on a4 and possibly the pawn on e4)

Let's analyze the most promising:

### 1. ...b5
- Chases the bishop to b3 or Bb3, then ...c4 can trap the bishop, but White can play c3 to give it a square.
- After ...b5, Ba4-b3, ...c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4-b3, c4, Ba4

1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except Black has played ...a6 and ...b5)
2. White has a slight space advantage with e4 pawn vs Black's c5 and b5 pawns
3. Black's light-squared bishop is restricted by pawns on b5 and c6
4. White's bishop on a4 is under attack by b5 pawn
5. Black has potential weaknesses on the queenside (a6, b5 pawns) that could be targeted
6. Castling rights: White can still castle either side, Black can castle kingside

Candidate moves to consider:
1. a4b3 - retreating bishop, but leaves it passive
2. a4b5 - counterattack on pawn, but axb5 opens a-file
3. e1g1 - castling kingside to safety
4. b1c3 - developing knight, putting pressure on d5
5. e4e5 - gaining space but may overextend
6. d2d4 - central break

After deep consideration:
- a4b5 seems tempting but after axb5, Black gets open a-file and White's bishop is exchanged for pawn
- e1g1 is solid but doesn't address the bishop issue
- b1c3 is interesting but doesn't solve the immediate bishop problem
- e4e5 is premature as it weakens d5 square
- d2d4 is the most principled move, opening the center while White has better development

d2d4 creates immediate tension in the center. After cxd4, Nxd4 maintains pressure and the bishop can retreat to c2 later if needed. This challenges Black's center and opens lines for White's pieces.

The move d2d4 also prevents Black from comfortably castling kingside as the center becomes unstable. It's the most dynamic and challenging response that maintains White's initiative.

2025-06-11 21:24:29,372 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.42s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/3ppppp/p1n5/1pp5/B2PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5

**Move history:** 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 b5 5. d4

**Position assessment:**
- White has just played d4, striking in the center.
- Black has a queenside pawn majority and space, but White is ahead in development and has a strong center.
- The bishop on a4 is well-placed, and White's next move could be d5, gaining more space and tempo.
- Black must be careful not to fall behind in development or allow White to dominate the center.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **cxd4**: Captures in the center, challenging White's space. White can recapture with the knight or queen. If Nxd4, then Bb7 develops with tempo.
2. **bxa4**: Captures the bishop, but after d5, White gets a strong center and tempo on the knight.
3. **e6**: Solid, but allows d5 with tempo.
4. **Nxd4**: Not possible, as the knight is on c6 and can't reach d4 in one move.
5. **g6, f6, h6, etc.**: Not urgent; the center is the main battleground.

**Deeper calculation:**

- **5...cxd4 6. Nxd4 Bb7**: Develops with tempo, attacks e4, and prepares ...Nf6. If 7. Nxc6 Bxc6 8. Bb3, Black is fine.
- **5...bxa4 6. d5**: White gains space, and after ...Na5, White can play Nc3 and e5, with a big center.
- **5...e6 6. d5 exd5 7. exd5 Qe7+ 8. Be3**: White is better developed.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture in the center with **cxd4**, challenging White's center and opening lines for development. This is the most principled and dynamic response.

**Final move:**

2025-06-11 21:25:24,410 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.25s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Current Position Assessment:
- Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and pawns)
- White has slightly better development with bishop on a4 and knight on f3
- Black has a pawn on d4, which is a passed pawn but potentially weak
- White has the bishop pair, which could become significant in an open position
- Black's king is still in the center while White can castle quickly

2. Key Features:
- The d4 pawn is a target
- Black's b5 pawn is loose and could be vulnerable
- White has the option to castle immediately
- Black's knight on c6 is pinned to the queen (if White takes b5)

3. Candidate Moves to Consider:
a) e1g1 (castling) - Safest option, brings king to safety
b) d1d4 - Immediately challenging the passed pawn
c) b1c3 - Developing a piece and adding pressure
d) a4b3 - Retreating the bishop but maintaining pressure

4. Deep Analysis:
- d1d4 looks tempting but after c6xd4, Nxd4 Qxd4, White loses the bishop pair and Black gets active play
- b1c3 is solid but doesn't address the immediate d4 pawn
- a4b5 is risky due to a6xb5 opening the a-file
- e1g1 is very solid but perhaps too passive
- a4b3 maintains the pin on c6 and keeps options open

5. Best Move:
a4b3 is the most flexible and positionally sound:
- Maintains the pin on c6
- Keeps pressure on d5 square
- Avoids opening the a-file for Black
- Prepares possible c2-c4 to challenge d4 pawn
- Doesn't allow Black any counterplay

The move maintains all of White's advantages while keeping options open for both kingside and queenside play. It's the most prudent choice in this critical position.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/3ppppp/p1n5/1p6/3pP3/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6

**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Both sides have all pieces except White is missing the dark-squared bishop (it is on b3, not captured).
- Pawns: Black has an extra pawn on d4 (after c5xd4), but White has good development and central control.

**Positional considerations:**
- White's bishop on b3 is well-placed, eyeing f7 and the center.
- Black has a strong pawn on d4, but it could become a target.
- Black's queenside is a bit loose, but White's king is still in the center.
- Black's knight on c6 is active, and the bishop on c8 is undeveloped.
- White threatens to play Nxd4, regaining the pawn and opening lines.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7-e5**: Supports the d4 pawn, gains space, and opens lines for the bishop. But after Bd5, White could pressure f7.
2. **e7-e6**: Solid, supports d5, but blocks the light-squared bishop.
3. **d7-d6**: Supports d4, but White can play Nxd4, and after Nxd4 Qxd4, White is active.
4. **g8-f6**: Develops a piece, attacks e4, but allows Nxd4.
5. **d8-a5**: Pins the knight on c3, but White can play Bd2.
6. **c8-b7**: Develops, but White can play Nxd4.
7. **b5-b4**: Attacks the knight on c3, but White can play Nxd4 first.
8. **d4-d3**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play Qxd3, gaining the initiative.

**Critical lines:**
- If Black plays e7-e5, White can play Bd5, pinning the knight and threatening f7.
- If Black plays g8-f6, White can play Nxd4, and after Nxe4, White can play Bd5, threatening mate on f7.
- If Black plays d7-d6, White can play Nxd4, and after Nxd4 Qxd4, White is better developed.

**Best move:**
- **e7-e5** is the most ambitious, supporting d4 and opening lines for the bishop. After e5, if White plays Bd5, Black can play Qc7, defending f7 and keeping the center.

**Final move:**
```
e7e5

2025-06-11 21:26:44,553 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.12s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except White has an extra pawn, but Black has an extra pawn on d4)
2. Black has a strong pawn center with e5 and d4 pawns
3. White's pieces are somewhat awkwardly placed (Bishop on b3 is blocked by d4 pawn)
4. Black's king is still in the center while White can castle

Key observations:
- Black's d4 pawn is a thorn in White's position
- White has the option to capture it with Qxd4, but needs to calculate carefully
- Castling immediately looks tempting but we should consider other options

Candidate moves to consider:
1. d1d4 (Qxd4) - immediately challenging the strong pawn
   - After ...Nxd4, Nxd4 exd4, White has a small advantage with better development
   - But this trades queens early which might relieve Black's position
2. e1g1 (castling) - getting the king to safety
   - Solid but doesn't address the d4 pawn issue
3. c2c3 - challenging the d4 pawn
   - After ...dxc3, Nxc3 gives White good central control
4. b1c3 - developing with tempo on d5
   - But Black can play ...Bb4 pinning the knight

After careful consideration, c2c3 seems most principled:
- Directly challenges Black's strong pawn
- Opens lines for White's pieces
- Maintains flexibility in development
- Doesn't allow Black to consolidate their center

The move c2c3 leads to positions where White can exploit their better development and piece activity. Black's best response is likely ...dxc3, after which Nxc3 gives White good central control and development advantage.

2025-06-11 21:27:13,532 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.55s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 6...c3 7. bxc3:**
- Black to move.
- Material is equal.
- White has a strong center, but Black has some space on the queenside.
- White's king is still in the center, but so is Black's.
- Black's d4 pawn is advanced and restricts White's pieces.
- White's bishop on b3 is active, but Black's pieces are mostly undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d4xc3**: Captures a pawn, but allows White to recapture with the knight or bishop, developing a piece.
2. **Nf6**: Develops a knight, attacks e4, but allows White to play cxd4, opening the center.
3. **Bb7**: Develops a bishop, supports the d4 pawn, but White can play cxd4.
4. **Be7**: Prepares to castle, but doesn't address the tension in the center.
5. **h6/g6**: Quiet moves, but not urgent.
6. **a5**: Expands on the queenside, but not urgent.

**Key Tactical Considerations:**
- If Black plays dxc3, White can play Nxc3, developing a piece and threatening Nd5.
- If Black plays Nf6, White can play cxd4, and after Nxd4, Nxe5 is possible.
- If Black plays Bb7, White can play cxd4, and after Nxd4, Nxe5 is again possible.

**Deep calculation for dxc3:**
- 7...dxc3 8. Nxc3 Nf6 (develops, attacks e4)
- 9. Ng5 (threatening Nxf7) d5 (blocking the bishop)
- 10. exd5 Nd4 (threatening Nxb3 and Nxd5)
- This line gives Black activity and keeps the pawn structure dynamic.

**Deep calculation for Nf6:**
- 7...Nf6 8. cxd4 exd4 9. e5 Ne4 10. Bd5 Nc5
- Black is slightly cramped, but no immediate tactical issues.

**Deep calculation for Bb7:**
- 7...Bb7 8. cxd4 Nxd4 9. Nxd4 exd4 10. Qxd4 Nf6
- White has a slight lead in development.

**Conclusion:**
- Capturing on c3 is the most direct and keeps the initiative, as it forces White to respond and opens lines for Black's pieces.
- The pawn on d4 is a spearhead, but if not captured, White will eventually play cxd4 and undermine it.
- By playing dxc3, Black can follow up with Nf6 and Bb7, developing rapidly.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 21:28:05,269 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.30s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and pawns)
2. Black has an advanced passed pawn on c3, but it's blockaded by White's knight
3. White has a strong bishop on b3 eyeing Black's kingside
4. Black's king is still in the center, while White can castle quickly
5. Black's pawn structure is slightly compromised with weaknesses on d5 and f7

Candidate moves to consider:
1. b1c3 - Developing the knight and attacking the c3 pawn, but Black can play ...d5 with counterplay
2. e1g1 - Castling to safety, but we might miss some attacking chances
3. b3f7+ - A tempting sacrifice to expose Black's king
4. d1d5 - Centralizing the queen with threats

After deep consideration:
- b3f7+ is very tempting. After ...e1f7, f3g5+ forks king and queen, winning the queen for two pieces. But Black can play ...e1e7 instead, and after f3g5+ e7e8, we don't have a clear follow-up.
- d1d5 looks strong, threatening to take on e5 and create multiple threats. Black's responses are limited:
  * If ...c6d4, we take with queen and have strong pressure
  * If ...f8e7, we can castle with ongoing pressure
  * If ...g8f6, we can play d5d7 pinning the pawn

d1d5 seems to give White the most enduring initiative while keeping all options open. It develops the queen to its most active square and creates multiple threats that Black will struggle to meet.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/3p1ppp/p1n5/1p1Qp3/4P3/1Bp2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 8

**White's last move:** Qd5 (attacking both f7 and e5, also eyeing the bishop on c6 if Black plays ...Qf6)

**Material count:** Equal, but White has a strong initiative and Black's king is still in the center.

**Threats:**
- White is threatening to take on f7 with check (Qxf7# is not mate, but wins a pawn and attacks the rook).
- White is also threatening Nxe5, exploiting the pin on the d-file and the pressure on f7.
- White's pieces are very active, Black's king is still in the center, and Black's queenside is undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe7**: Defends f7 and e5, but blocks the bishop and the knight.
2. **Qf6**: Defends f7 and e5, but allows Qxc6, winning a piece.
3. **Nh6**: Develops, but doesn't address the threats.
4. **Qe7**: Seems the most solid, defending both f7 and e5, and preparing to develop the bishop.

Let's check **Qe7**:
- 8...Qe7
  - If White plays Nxe5, then ...Nxe5, and if Qxa8, then ...Nxf3+ gxf3 Rxa8, Black is down the exchange but has some compensation due to White's exposed king.
  - If White plays Qxc6, then dxc6, and Black is fine.

Let's check **Qf6**:
- 8...Qf6
  - White plays Qxc6, winning a piece.

Let's check **Nf6**:
- 8...Nf6
  - White plays Qxf7#, which is mate.

Let's check **Qb6**:
- Not a legal move.

Let's check **Qe7** again:
- 8...Qe7
  - If White plays Nxe5, then ...Nxe5, and if Qxa8, then ...Nxf3+ gxf3 Rxa8, Black is down the exchange but has some compensation.

**Conclusion:** The best move is **Qe7**, defending both f7 and e5, and preparing to develop the bishop.

2025-06-11 21:29:06,585 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.72s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material: White is up a pawn (Queen vs Queen, minor pieces equal)
2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center, while White's is slightly exposed but can castle
3. Key features:
   - White's queen is very active on d5
   - Black has a pawn on c3 that's a thorn in White's position
   - Black's e5 pawn is weak and potentially attackable
   - Black's knight on c6 is pinned to the queen

Candidate moves to consider:

1. d5f7 - Queen sac, but after ...Kxf7 Ng5+ Ke8 Nxe7 Kxe7, White has compensation but not clearly winning
2. d5e6 - Threatening mate on f7, but Black can defend with ...fxe6
3. f3e5 - Capturing the pawn, but Black can play ...Qxe5
4. b1c3 - Developing and attacking c3 pawn, but Black can play ...Qxc3
5. e1g1 - Castling to safety, but seems slow
6. d5d7 - Forking queen and rook, but after ...Qxd7, Black is fine

The most promising seems d5e6:
- Threatens mate on f7
- If Black takes with ...fxe6, then Ng5 attacks e6 and the king
- Black's best is probably ...Qxe6, but then Nxe5! wins material as the queen is overloaded

After 1. d5e6 Qxe6 2. Nxe5 Qxe5 3. Bxe5, White wins a clean pawn and has a strong position.

Let me verify if Black has any better defenses after d5e6:
- If ...fxe6, then Ng5 Qf6 (only move to prevent mate) and White has strong play with Qd3 or Bc4 ideas
- Other moves like ...Qd6 allow Qxd6 cxd6 Nxe5 winning a pawn

This seems like the most forcing and advantageous continuation.

- Black's pieces: knight on c6, bishop on c8, bishop on f8, knight on g8, rook on a8, rook on h8, pawns on a6, b5, c3, d7, e5, f7, g7, h7.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The queen on e6 is vulnerable to attack.
- Black can play ...d7xe6, attacking the queen and developing.
- ...Qxe6 is not possible, as the queen is already on e7.
- ...d7xe6 is a forcing move, attacking the queen and opening the d-file for the rook.
- ...c3xb2 is also possible, attacking the rook on a1 and threatening to promote the pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...d7xe6 (attacks the queen, develops, and opens the d-file)
2. ...c3xb2 (attacks the rook, but White can play Qxc6+ and then capture the rook on a8)
3. ...f7xe6 (also attacks the queen, but weakens the kingside)
4. ...Qxe6 (illegal, as the queen is already on e7)
5. ...Nf6 (develops, but does not address the queen on e6)
6. ...Bb7 (develops, but does not address the queen on e6)

**Analysis of ...d7xe6:**
- After ...d7xe6, White's queen must move.
- If Qxc6+, Bd7 blocks.
- If Qxe5, Black can play Nxe5, regaining the pawn and developing.
- After ...d7xe6, Black has a solid position and can continue developing.

**Analysis of ...c3xb2:**
- After ...c3xb2, White can play Qxc6+, Bd7, Qxa8+, and White wins a rook.
- This is not good for Black.

**Analysis of ...f7xe6:**
- After ...f7xe6, White can play Qxc6+, Bd7, Qxa8+, and again White wins a rook.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is ...d7xe6, attacking the queen and developing.

**Final move:**
```
d7e6

2025-06-11 21:30:05,055 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.18s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and rooks, no queens)
2. White has a bishop pair vs bishop+knight for Black
3. Black has a passed c3 pawn, but it's blockaded by White's knight
4. White's king is still in the center while Black's is castled
5. Black has some pressure on the e4 pawn

Candidate moves to consider:
1. b1c3 - Developing the knight and attacking the c3 pawn
2. b3e6 - Trading bishop for knight, but this may relieve Black's pressure
3. e1g1 - Castling to safety
4. f3e5 - Centralizing the knight and attacking f7

Deeper analysis:
- b1c3 looks tempting but after ...Qxc3+ White's king would be exposed
- b3e6 gives up the bishop pair advantage
- e1g1 is safe but may be too passive
- f3e5 is very strong:
  * Attacks f7 which is only defended by the king
  * Prepares to bring the rook to f1
  * If Black takes with ...Nxe5, White recaptures with dxe5 and gets a strong central pawn
  * If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Bc4 or castling

The most active and promising move is f3e5, putting immediate pressure on Black's position while developing White's initiative.

2025-06-11 21:30:27,123 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.68s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Down a pawn, but White's king is exposed and Black's pieces are active.
- White: King on e1, rook on h1 and a1, bishop on b3, knight on e5, pawns on a2, b2, e4, f2, g2, h2.

**Positional factors:**
- White's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (bishop on b3 blocks queenside).
- Black's queen is on e7, knight on c6, bishop on f8, pawns on a6, b5, c3, e6, f7, g7, h7.
- Black's c3 pawn is a passed pawn and very strong.
- White's knight on e5 is centralized but not threatening immediate tactics.
- Black's king is still on e8, but not under direct threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c3xb2**: Captures a pawn, threatens to promote, and attacks the rook on a1. White must respond.
2. **Nxe5**: Exchanges knights, but after dxe5, White's center is strong and Black loses the c3 pawn.
3. **Nxe5 dxe5 Qc5**: Not as strong; White's bishop on b3 is loose, but Black's c3 pawn is lost.
4. **Qxe5**: Not possible, as the knight is protected by the bishop.
5. **Qd6**: Defends c3, but is passive.
6. **Bb7**: Develops, but c3 pawn is hanging.
7. **g6**: Prepares to fianchetto, but slow.

**Tactical considerations:**
- The move **c3xb2** is very strong, as it threatens to promote and attacks the rook. If White plays Bxb2, Black can play Qb4+ and pick up the bishop on b3 or force White's king into the center.
- If White ignores and plays Nxc6, bxa1=Q, White can try to get compensation, but Black will have a queen for a rook and bishop.

**Calculation:**
- 10...c3xb2
    - 11. Bxb2 Qb4+ 12. Nc3 Qxe4+ wins a piece.
    - 11. Nxc6 bxa1=Q 12. Nxe7 Bxe7, Black is up material.
    - 11. O-O Nxe5, Black is fine.

**Conclusion:**
The move **c3xb2** is the strongest, as it creates immediate threats and forces White to respond, giving Black a decisive advantage.

My move is:
```
c3b2

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. White has a knight on e5 that is very active and threatening.
2. Black's king is still in the center, which is generally a weakness.
3. Black has a pawn on b2 that is threatening to promote, but it's currently blockaded by White's pieces.
4. White's bishop on b3 is very strong, eyeing the f7 square.
5. Black's queen on e7 is somewhat awkwardly placed.

Candidate moves to consider:
1. e5f7 - This looks very tempting as it sacrifices the knight to open up Black's king position.
2. b3e6 - Capturing the pawn and developing the bishop further.
3. e5c6 - Forking the queen and rook, but Black can simply take the knight with the pawn.
4. b1c3 - Developing the knight and adding pressure.

Let me analyze e5f7 in depth:
- After e5f7+ kf7, White can play b3e6+ forking king and queen. Black would likely play ke6, then we can play d1d5+ with a strong attack. The king is exposed and White has good compensation for the sacrificed material.

Alternative b3e6:
- This wins a pawn but is less forcing. Black can play qe6 and we don't have the same attacking potential.

After careful consideration, e5f7 leads to a very dangerous attack against Black's king while their pieces are uncoordinated. The sacrifice is sound and leads to a winning advantage for White.

Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Position after 11. Nf7:**

FEN: r1b1kbnr/4qNpp/p1n1p3/1p6/4P3/1B6/Pp3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 11

White's last move was Nf7, forking the queen on e7 and the rook on h8. Black to move.

**Material count:**
- White: Down a pawn, but threatening to win the exchange (rook for knight) and has a strong knight on f7.
- Black: Up a pawn, but under immediate tactical threat.

**Immediate threats:**
- White threatens Nxh8, winning the rook.
- The queen on e7 is attacked by the knight on f7.
- Black's king is still in the center, and the queenside is undeveloped.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxf7**: Queen captures knight, but then White can play Bxf7+ and after Kxf7, White is up the exchange.
2. **Kxf7**: King captures knight, but then Qf3+ is very strong for White, attacking the king and the rook on a8.
3. **Qb4+**: Check, but White can block with Bd2 or Nc3.
4. **Na5**: Attacks the bishop on b3, but doesn't solve the problem of the knight on f7.
5. **Nd4**: Attacks the bishop on b3, but again, the knight on f7 is a problem.
6. **Qh4**: Attacks the pawn on e4, but doesn't solve the immediate threat.

**Critical lines:**

- If **Qxf7**, then Bxf7+ Kxf7, White is up the exchange.
- If **Kxf7**, then Qf3+ Ke8 (if Kg8, then Bxe6), White is very active.
- If **Qb4+**, White can play Bd2, and Black still loses the rook.
- If **Na5**, White simply takes the rook.

**Is there any way to avoid losing the rook?**

- **Qb4+** Bd2 Qxe4+ Kd1 Qxg2: Black wins a pawn, but White is up the exchange and has a safer king.

**Is there a way to trap the knight on f7?**
- Not immediately, as the knight can always escape after taking the rook.

**What about e6-e5?**
- Doesn't help, as White still takes the rook.

**What about Qh4?**
- White can play Nxh8, and Black has no compensation.

**What about Qb4+?**
- Let's analyze this line in detail:

1... Qb4+  
2. Bd2 Qxe4+  
3. Kd1 Qxg2  
4. Re1 Qg4+  
5. f3 Qxg2  
6. Nxh8

Black is down the exchange and White's king is a bit exposed, but Black's king is also unsafe.

**What about Qxf7?**
- 1... Qxf7 2. Bxf7+ Kxf7 3. Nc3 (threatening to trap the king) Nf6 4. O-O and White is up the exchange.

**What about e6-e5?**
- Doesn't help.

**What about Kxf7?**
- 1... Kxf7 2. Qf3+ Ke8 (if Kg8, Bxe6+) 3. e5 Bb7 4. exd6 Qxd6 5. O-O and White is up the exchange.

**What about Qh4?**
- 1... Qh4 2. Nxh8 Qxe4+ 3. Be3 Qxg2 4. Rf1 and White is up the exchange.

**What about Qb4+?**
- 1... Qb4+ 2. Bd2 Qxe4+ 3. Kd1 Qxg2 4. Re1 Qf3+ 5. Kc2 Qxf7 and Black regains the knight, but White is up the exchange.

**Best practical chance:**

- **Qb4+** is the only move that at least forces White to respond and may allow Black to regain the knight after Qxe4+ and Qxg2.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e7b4

2025-06-11 21:31:57,584 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.57s):
Let me analyze the position deeply.

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, minor pieces, but White has an extra pawn)
2. Black's king is exposed in the center (still on e8)
3. White's knight on f7 is very active, but pinned to the king by Black's queen
4. Black has threats with the queen on b4 attacking b3 bishop and e1 king
5. White's king is in some danger due to open e-file and Black's queen activity

Candidate moves to consider:
1. e1e2 - moves king away from danger but leaves knight hanging
2. e1f1 - moves king towards safety but still leaves knight hanging
3. e1d1 - moves king away but into potential discovered checks
4. c1d2 - defends b3 bishop but doesn't address knight pin
5. b1c3 - develops knight and defends b5 pawn but doesn't solve immediate problems
6. b1d2 - develops knight and defends b3 bishop

Best move appears to be b1d2 because:
- It defends the b3 bishop which is under attack
- It maintains the powerful knight on f7 (after Black takes bishop, we can recapture with knight)
- It develops a piece while addressing the most urgent threat
- Other king moves either lose material or leave the position too exposed

After b1d2, if Black takes the bishop with b4xb3, we can recapture with d2xb3, maintaining material equality but with better piece coordination. Our knight remains powerfully placed on f7, and we can look to castle queenside or bring the king to safety.

The other moves either lose material or leave our position too vulnerable. For example, moving the king would likely lose the knight on f7, giving Black a material advantage.

```

2025-06-11 21:32:29,914 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.23s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen (b4), 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight (c6), 6 pawns (a6, b5, b2, e6, g7, h7), king (e8)
- White: Queen is missing, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight (d2), knight (f7), 6 pawns (a2, c3, e4, f2, g2, h2), king (e1), bishop (b3)

**Key features:**
- Black is up a queen for a knight and pawn.
- White's knight on f7 is menacing, but not immediately threatening mate.
- Black's b2 pawn is one step from queening.
- White's king is still in the center and cannot castle kingside (the knight on f7 blocks it).
- Black's queen is very active on b4, attacking d2 and e4.
- White's bishop on b3 is defending c2 and a2, but not b2.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The pawn on b2 can promote, but White can recapture with the rook or bishop.
- The move b2-b1=Q is tempting, but after Rxb1, Black loses the pawn for a rook trade, but remains up a queen for a knight.
- The move Qxd2+ is possible, but after Bxd2, Black loses the queen for a bishop, which is not good.
- The move Qxe4+ is possible, but after Nxe4, Black loses the queen for a knight, which is not good.
- The move Qc3 attacks both the bishop on b3 and the knight on d2, but White can defend with Rb1 or Qc2.

**Defensive considerations:**
- White's knight on f7 is not threatening anything immediate.
- White's bishop on b3 is defending c2 and a2.
- Black's king is relatively safe for now.

**Candidate moves:**
1. b2-b1=Q (promote pawn)
2. Qxd2+ (capture knight)
3. Qc3 (attack bishop and knight)
4. Qe4+ (check)
5. Nf6 (develop knight)
6. a5 (push pawn, but not urgent)
7. g7-g6 (make luft, but not urgent)

**Deep analysis:**

1. **b2-b1=Q**
   - White can play Rxb1 or Bxb1.
   - After Rxb1, Black can play Qxe4+ (since the bishop on b3 is pinned to the king).
   - If Qxe4+, White can block with Be3 or Nxe4.
   - Black remains up a queen for a knight, with a winning position.

2. **Qxd2+**
   - Bxd2, and Black loses the queen for a bishop. Not good.

3. **Qc3**
   - Attacks both bishop and knight.
   - White can play Rb1, defending both.
   - No immediate gain.

4. **Qe4+**
   - Nxe4, Black loses queen for knight. Not good.

5. **Nf6**
   - Develops, but not urgent.

**Best move:**

Promoting the pawn is the most forcing and decisive. After b2-b1=Q, if White plays Rxb1, Black can play Qxe4+ (since the bishop is pinned), winning another pawn and keeping the initiative.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b2b1q
```

2025-06-11 21:33:00,558 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.13s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. White has a knight on f7 that has just captured something (likely the king was on e8 before)
2. Black has just played ...b2b1q, promoting a pawn to a queen while simultaneously checking White's king
3. White's king is in check and must respond
4. Black has a queen on b4 and a newly promoted queen on b1, creating multiple threats
5. White has a knight fork possibility with Nf7-d8 attacking both the king and rook

First, let's address the immediate check. The king has several options:
- e1e2: but then Qb4xe2 would be devastating
- e1f1: runs into Qb1xf1+
- e1d1: seems safest, but then black has Qb4xd2
- h1g1: possible, but allows Qb1xa1
- a1b1: blocks the check by sacrificing the rook

Looking deeper:
- a1b1 seems forced, as other moves lose material or get mated
After a1b1 Qb1xa1, then we can play Nf7d8+ forking king and rook
Black would likely play Ke8d8, then we have Bb3xe6 with strong threats

Alternatively, if we play e1d1 first, after Qb4xd2 the position collapses for white.

Therefore, the best practical chance is to block with the rook and then fork with the knight.

2025-06-11 21:33:17,564 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.04s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen (b4), Rook (a8), Bishop (c8, f8), Knight (c6), Pawns (a6, b5, e6, g7, h7), King (e8)
- White: Rook (b1, h1), Bishop (b3, c1), Knight (d2), Pawns (a2, e4, f2, g2, h2), King (e1)

**Key features:**
- Black is up a queen for a rook and minor piece.
- White's king is on e1, uncastled, and somewhat exposed.
- Black's queen is very active on b4, attacking b3 and d2.
- White's knight on f7 is deep in Black's position, but not immediately threatening mate.
- Black's king is still in the center but not under direct threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxe4+**: Immediate check, forcing White's king to move or block. If White plays Nxe4, Black can play Kxf7, regaining the piece and keeping a material advantage.
2. **Kxf7**: Captures the knight, but allows White to play Qh5+ or Ng5+ (if White had a queen, but White does not).
3. **Qxd2+**: Captures a piece with check, but White can block with Bxd2 or Kxd2.
4. **Qe4+**: As above, but let's check the consequences.

**Calculation for Qxe4+:**
- 1... Qxe4+ 2. Nxe4 Kxf7 (Black regains the knight, up a queen for a rook and bishop)
- 1... Qxe4+ 2. Kd1 (if White avoids the exchange), then Black can play Kxf7, still up material.

**Calculation for Qxd2+:**
- 1... Qxd2+ 2. Bxd2 Kxf7 (Black up a queen for a rook and bishop)

**Calculation for Kxf7:**
- 1... Kxf7 2. Nf3 (threatening Ng5+), but Black is still up material.

**Is there any immediate threat from White?**
- White cannot deliver a check or mate immediately.

**Which move is most forcing and keeps the initiative?**
- **Qxe4+** is the most forcing, as it checks the king and forces White to respond.

**Final decision:**
```
Qxe4+

2025-06-11 21:33:52,235 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.55s):
Let me analyze the position deeply.

Current position assessment:
- Material: White is down a rook and bishop for a knight (Black has extra ~4 points of material)
- King safety: White's king is exposed in the center, Black's king is somewhat safer
- Key threats: Black's queen on e4 is very active, eyeing multiple squares
- Development: Both sides have developed pieces, but White's rooks aren't connected

Legal moves to consider:
1. e1f1 - King moves to relative safety
2. e1d1 - King moves towards the queenside
3. d2e4 - Capturing the queen with the knight

Let's examine each:

1. e1f1:
- Gets the king off the e-file
- But leaves the h1 rook hanging to the queen
- Black can play Qxh1 winning more material

2. e1d1:
- Moves king towards queenside
- Still leaves h1 rook vulnerable to Qxh1
- May allow Black to consolidate their material advantage

3. d2e4:
- Captures the dangerous queen
- After Nxe4, Black can recapture with fxe4, but then:
  - Bxe6+ forks king and rook
  - After Kf7, Bxc8 wins the rook
  - White gets significant material back
- This seems like the best practical chance

The knight capture on e4 is the most forcing move and leads to complications where White can regain some material. While still worse, it's the best practical chance to complicate matters and possibly turn the tide.

After Nxe4 fxe4 Bxe6+ Kf7 Bxc8, White would be down a knight for two pawns, which is better than the current material deficit.

```

2025-06-11 21:34:18,511 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 10.29s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 1 knight, 6 pawns
- White: 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 6 pawns

Black is down a queen for a rook and a knight, but White's king is exposed on e1, and Black's queen is not on the board. However, Black has a strong initiative: White's king is in the center, and Black's pieces are active.

**Key tactical points:**
- White's king is on e1, unable to castle.
- Black's queen is gone, but Black has a rook on a8, bishop on f8, knight on c6, and pawns that can be pushed.
- White's knight on f7 is attacking the rook on h8 and threatening to take on h8.
- White's bishop on b3 is strong, but the knight on e4 is also centralized.

**Immediate threats:**
- White threatens Nxh8, winning the exchange.
- Black can consider castling queenside (not possible, no queen), moving the rook, or defending the h8 rook.
- Black can also consider attacking moves like ...Bb4+ or ...Nd4.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **...Kxf7:** Captures the knight, but exposes the king further.
2. **...Qxe4:** No queen.
3. **...Bb4+:** Check, but White can block with Bd2 or Nc3.
4. **...Nd4:** Attacks the bishop on b3 and threatens ...Nxb3, but White can play Nxh8.
5. **...Nf6:** Develops, but doesn't address the threat.
6. **...Kxf7:** Let's look at this more closely.

If 1...Kxf7 2.Ng5+ (forking king and rook), but the king can move to g6 or e8. Let's check:

1...Kxf7 2.Ng5+ Ke8 (if Kg6, then h4 is dangerous) 3.Nxe4 and White has won an exchange and a pawn.

Alternatively, **...Nd4** attacks the bishop and threatens ...Nxb3. If 2.Nxh8, then ...Nxb3 3.axb3 Bb7 and Black gets some play.

Alternatively, **...Bb4+** 2.Bd2 Bxd2+ 3.Kxd2 and White's king is even more exposed, but Black is still down material.

Alternatively, **...h6** attacks the knight, but after Nxh8, White wins the exchange.

Alternatively, **...Nf6** develops, but doesn't solve the issue.

Alternatively, **...e5e5** (already played).

Alternatively, **...a6a5** or **...b5b4**.

**Best move:**

After careful analysis, the move **Nd4** stands out. It attacks the bishop on b3, threatens ...Nxb3, and if White grabs the rook with Nxh8, Black can play ...Nxb3, and after axb3, Bb7, Black gets strong play on the long diagonal and White's king remains exposed.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c6d4

2025-06-11 21:34:50,820 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.74s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. Material is roughly equal (White has knight+rook vs Black's queen, but White has two active knights)
2. Black's king is exposed with no pawn cover
3. White has strong knight on f7 threatening multiple squares
4. Black's queen is somewhat awkwardly placed on e4
5. White has the bishop pair with active pieces

Candidate moves to consider:
1. e4f6 - This looks very strong, attacking the queen while opening discovered attacks
2. f7d8 - Forking queen and rook, but Black can defend
3. b3e6 - Pinning the pawn, but not as direct
4. e4g5 - Developing the knight but not as forcing

After deep analysis:
- e4f6 is extremely strong because:
  * It attacks the queen
  * After Qxf4, Nxf4 leaves White up material
  * If Black moves the queen, we have discovered attacks (e.g. Qe7 allows Bxe6)
  * It maintains all of White's threats

Other moves don't have the same immediate impact. For example:
- f7d8 allows Qe7 defending
- b3e6 is met with f5 defending
- e4g5 doesn't create immediate threats

The move e4f6 wins material by force while keeping the initiative. Black has no good way to defend both the queen and the discovered attacks.

2025-06-11 21:35:17,680 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 10.33s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Position after 14...Nf6:**

- Black: King on e8, Queen is gone, Rooks on h8 and a8, Bishop on c8, Knight on d4, pawns on a6, b5, e6, g7, h7.
- White: King on e1, Rooks on h1 and b1, Bishop on b3, Knight on f7 and f6, pawns on a2, f2, g2, h2.

**Material count:**
- Black: Down a queen, but up a rook and two minor pieces for it. White has two knights on f7 and f6, both menacing.
- Black's king is in the center, but White's king is also not castled.
- White's threats: The knight on f7 attacks the rook on h8 and the pawn on e5. The knight on f6 is also close to the king.
- Black's threats: The knight on d4 is very strong, hitting b3 and c2. The bishop on c8 can come to b7 or d7. The rook on h8 is attacked.

**Legal moves:**
- e8f7 (King takes knight on f7)
- e8e7 (King moves to e7)
- g8f6 (Knight takes knight on f6)
- g7f6 (Pawn takes knight on f6)

Let's analyze each move:

---

### 1. **e8f7 (King takes knight on f7)**

- White can play Bxe6+ (bishop check), and after Nxe6, White can play Bxe6+ again, but Black can block with Nxe6.
- But after Kxf7, White can play Bxe6+ Nxe6, Bxe6+ Kxe6, and White is up a piece and has a safer king.
- Also, after Kxf7, White can play Nxh8, winning the rook.

### 2. **e8e7 (King to e7)**

- White can play Nd5+, forking king and bishop, or Nxh8, winning the rook.
- After Kd6, White can play Nf7, and Black's king is very exposed.

### 3. **g8f6 (Knight takes knight on f6)**

- White can play Nxh8, winning the rook.
- After Kf7, White can play Bxe6+.

### 4. **g7f6 (Pawn takes knight on f6)**

- White can play Nxh8, winning the rook.
- But after fxg6, White's bishop on b3 is attacked by the knight on d4.
- After Nxh8, Nxb3, axb3, Kf8, Black has some compensation, but White is up the exchange.

---

#### Let's look deeper at 4. g7f6:

1. ... g7f6  
2. Nxh8 Nxb3  
3. axb3 Kf8 (to save the rook)  
4. Bh6+ Kg8  
5. Rd1 Bb7

Black is down the exchange, but has two bishops and some activity.

---

#### Let's look at 1. ... Kxf7:

1. ... Kxf7  
2. Nxh8+ Kg8  
3. Bxe6+ Nxe6  
4. Bxe6+ Kxh8

White is up a piece and the exchange.

---

#### Let's look at 1. ... Nxf6:

1. ... Nxf6  
2. Nxh8 Nxb3  
3. axb3 Kf8  
4. Bh6+ Kg8  
5. Bg5 Kxh8

Again, White is up the exchange.

---

#### Let's look at 1. ... Ke7:

1. ... Ke7  
2. Nxh8 Nxb3  
3. axb3 Kf8  
4. Bh6+ Kg8  
5. Bg5 Kxh8

Same as above.

---

### Conclusion

All moves lose the rook on h8, but after ...gxf6, Black gets the bishop on b3 and can try to activate the king. This gives Black the best practical chances, as White's king is still in the center and Black has two bishops.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
g7f6

2025-06-11 21:35:50,191 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.70s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. White has a knight on f7 that is very active but potentially trapped.
2. Black has a strong centralized knight on d4.
3. White's king is still in the center, which is dangerous.
4. Black's king is also uncastled but has more pawn cover.
5. Material is roughly equal (White has knight vs Black's bishop pair).

The most critical issue is the f7 knight. It looks powerful but has limited escape squares. Let's examine the knight moves first:

- f7h8: Captures the rook but allows ...Ke7 trapping the knight
- f7d8: Checks the king but after ...Ke7 the knight is trapped
- f7h6: Seems interesting but ...gxh6 would win the knight
- f7d6: Maybe the best chance, attacking the bishop and opening an escape route
- f7g5/e5: Both seem to lose the knight after ...Ke7

Other candidate moves:
- b3e6: Defends the knight but allows ...fxe6 winning material
- e1d2: Getting the king to safety but allows Black to consolidate
- c1h6: Interesting sacrifice to open the king, but unclear

After careful consideration, f7d6 seems the most promising:
1. It attacks the bishop on e6
2. If ...exd6, then Bxe6 is strong for White
3. If ...Bxd6, then Nxd6+ and the knight escapes
4. If ...Ke7, then Nxe6! is strong

This seems to maintain White's activity while solving the knight's predicament. Other moves either lose material or allow Black to consolidate.

2025-06-11 21:36:18,038 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.74s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1b1kbnr/7p/p2Npp2/1p6/3n4/1B6/P4PPP/1RB1K2R b Kkq - 1 16

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (c8), Knight (d4), King (e8), Bishop (f8), Knight (g8), pawns (a6, b5, f6, h7)
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (b3), Bishop (c1), Knight (d6), King (e1), pawns (a2, f2, g2, h2)

**White threats:**
- The knight on d6 is very strong, forking the king and rook, and threatening to capture on c8.
- White is threatening to play Nxc8, winning the rook.
- White's king is safe, and Black's king is still in the center.

**Black's options:**
Legal moves: e8d8, e8e7, e8d7, f8d6

Let's analyze each:

1. **e8d8**: King moves to d8. The knight can take the rook on a8 (Nxc8), but then Black can play Nxb3, winning the bishop. However, after axb3, White is up a rook for a knight.
2. **e8e7**: King moves to e7. White can play Nxc8+, winning the rook with check. After Kf7, White is up a rook for a knight.
3. **e8d7**: King moves to d7. White can play Nxc8, again winning the rook.
4. **f8d6**: Bishop captures the knight on d6. This removes White's strong knight and avoids losing the rook on a8.

**Let's look at f8d6:**
- 16...f8d6
- 17. c1e3 (White develops, maybe planning to castle)
- Black is still down material (exchange and pawn), but the position is more tenable than losing a rook for a knight.

**Conclusion:**
- The only move that doesn't lose material immediately is **f8d6**. All king moves allow Nxc8, losing the rook for a knight.
- By playing f8d6, Black removes White's dangerous knight and keeps the rook.

**Final move:**
```
f8d6

2025-06-11 21:36:53,471 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 19.72s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material Count:
- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight vs Black's Rook, Bishop, Knight - material is equal
- But White's pieces are more active and coordinated

2. King Safety:
- White's king is somewhat exposed after castling
- Black's king is still in the center, which is dangerous

3. Piece Activity:
- White's rook on b1 is active
- White's bishop on b3 is very strong, controlling key diagonals
- Black's knight on d4 is well-placed but can be challenged

4. Immediate Threats:
- Black has a discovered attack possibility with the bishop on d6
- White needs to be careful about back rank threats

5. Candidate Moves Analysis:
- b3e6: Captures the pawn but allows ...d5 winning the bishop
- b3d5: Challenges the strong knight but allows ...exd5
- c1h6: Interesting sacrifice to expose the black king
- e1g1: Gets the king to safety
- h1f1: Brings rook to a more active file

The most promising move is c1h6!, a bishop sacrifice to open up the black king:
- After ...gxh6, White plays Rh1 with a strong attack
- If Black declines with ...Ke7, White maintains pressure
- This leads to a dangerous initiative against the exposed black king

The sacrifice is sound because:
1. Black's king is vulnerable in the center
2. White has multiple pieces that can join the attack quickly
3. Black's pieces are uncoordinated for defense
4. Even if material is lost, the attacking chances compensate

Other moves either don't create enough threats or allow Black to consolidate. This is the most forcing and dangerous continuation.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen (b1), Rook (a8), Bishop (d6), Knight (d4), Pawns (a6, b5, e6, f6, h7), King (e8)
- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (b3, h6), Pawns (a2, f2, g2, h2), King (e1), Rook (h1)

**Key features:**
- Black is up a queen for a rook and bishop (material advantage).
- White's king is on e1, rooks are disconnected, and the bishop on h6 is active but not threatening immediate mate.
- Black's knight on d4 is very strong, controlling central and kingside squares.
- Black's bishop on d6 is well-placed, eyeing h2 and b4.
- White's bishop on b3 is not threatening much.
- White's only threat is a possible discovered attack with the bishop on h6, but there is no immediate mate threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxb3** (d4b3): Captures the bishop, further increasing material advantage.
2. **Bb4+** (d6b4): Check, but White can block with Bd2 or Kf1.
3. **Nf5** (d4f5): Attacks the bishop on h6 and threatens to trade off White's active piece.
4. **Qe4** (b1e4): Centralizes the queen, but not as forcing.
5. **Ke7** (e8e7): King safety, but not urgent.
6. **e5** (e6e5): Opens the bishop, but not urgent.

**Tactical check:**
- Nxb3 is safe: after axb3, Black can play Bb4+ and win the rook on b1.
- If White does not recapture, Black is up a piece.

**Calculation:**
1. d4b3 a2b3 d6b4+ Ke2 (or Kf1) Bb7 (or Qe4) — Black is up a piece and attacks continue.
2. d4b3: If White ignores, Black is up a bishop.

**Conclusion:**
- **Nxb3** is the best move: it wins a bishop, increases material advantage, and keeps all threats under control.

My move is:

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, and pawns)
2. Black has a passed pawn on b3, but it's blockaded by White's rook
3. White's bishop on h6 is very active, eyeing the f8 square which would trap Black's king in the center
4. Black's king is still in the center (e8), while White's king is slightly safer after castling
5. Black's queen is very active on e4, but White has ways to challenge it

Candidate moves to consider:
1. h6f8 - immediately attacking the king and forcing it to move
2. h6g7 - threatening to win the f6 pawn
3. e1g1 - getting the king safer
4. b1b3 - challenging the passed pawn

After deep consideration:
- h6f8 is very tempting as it forces the king to move (likely to e7), after which we can play b1b3 to challenge the pawn. The king will be very exposed in the center.
- h6g7 allows Black to defend with ...Qe7, and we don't gain as much
- Castling is safe but doesn't press the advantage
- b1b3 immediately allows Black counterplay with ...Qc2

The most forcing and aggressive move is h6f8, which maintains our initiative and keeps Black's king in danger. This aligns with the instruction to press the advantage relentlessly.

```

2025-06-11 21:38:35,058 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.35s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after White's last move (18. Bf8):**

- White's king is on e1, rook on b1 and h1, bishop on f8, pawns on a2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black's king is on e8, rook on a8, bishop on d6, knight on b3, pawns on a6, b5, e6, f6, h7.
- Black to move.

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook, bishop, knight, 5 pawns (down the exchange, but up a pawn)
- White: 2 rooks, bishop, 4 pawns

**Key features:**
- Black's knight on b3 is very strong, attacking a1 and c1 squares.
- Black's bishop on d6 is powerful, controlling the long diagonal.
- White's bishop on f8 is threatening to take on d6, but if it does, Black can recapture with the knight or pawn.
- White's king is relatively safe for now, but Black has some initiative.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bxf8** is threatened, so we must consider moves that address this.
2. **Nd2+** is not possible, but **Nc5** or **a5** are possible.
3. **Bb4+** is not possible, but **Bb4** is not a legal move.
4. **Bb7** is possible, but not very active.
5. **Kxf8** is not possible.
6. **Bxf8** is not a threat, since after Kxf8, Black is fine.
7. **Bb4+** is not possible.
8. **Nc5** is a possible retreat, but does it do anything?
9. **Bxf8** is not a threat, since after Kxf8, Black is fine.

**Tactical ideas:**
- If White plays Bxd6, Black can recapture with the knight, keeping the strong knight.
- If Black plays Nc5, the knight is safe and can attack e4.
- If Black plays Bxf8, White recaptures with the king, and Black loses the bishop pair.

**Best move:**
- The move **Nc5** looks strong, as it moves the knight to a safer square, attacks e4, and keeps the pressure.
- Alternatively, **Bxf8** is not a threat, since after Kxf8, Black is fine.
- **Kxf8** is not possible.
- **Bxf8** is not a threat, since after Kxf8, Black is fine.

**But let's check the most forcing moves:**
- **Bxf8** is not a threat, since after Kxf8, Black is fine.
- **Nc5** is a possible move.
- **Bxf8** is not a threat, since after Kxf8, Black is fine.

**Let's check for any tactics:**
- **Nc5** is a good move, as it keeps the knight active and attacks e4.
- **Bxf8** is not a threat, since after Kxf8, Black is fine.

**Final decision:**
- The best move is **Nc5**, as it keeps the knight active and attacks e4.

So, my move is:
```
b3c5

2025-06-11 21:39:17,427 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.22s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White: Rook, Rook, King; Black: Rook, Bishop, King)
2. Black's king is exposed on the kingside
3. White has a rook on b1 and can potentially create threats along the b-file
4. Black's bishop on d6 is a strong piece controlling important squares
5. White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger

Candidate moves to consider:
1. Rook moves (Rb5, Rb4, etc.) - activating the rook
2. King moves (Ke2, Kf1) - improving king safety
3. Pawn moves (h3, g3) - limiting Black's counterplay
4. Rook to d1 - centralizing

After careful consideration:
- Rb5 looks tempting to attack the b5 pawn, but Black can defend with ...Bc7
- Ke2 improves king safety but doesn't create threats
- Rd1 is interesting but may be too slow
- h3 prevents any potential ...Bg3 ideas and gives the king a safe square

The most solid move appears to be h2h3, which:
1. Prevents any future ...Bg3+ ideas
2. Gives the king a potential escape square on h2
3. Doesn't create any weaknesses
4. Maintains flexibility for other plans

Other moves either create unnecessary risks or don't improve White's position sufficiently.

2025-06-11 21:39:54,141 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.43s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen (b1), Rook (a8), Bishop (d6), Knight (none), Pawns (a6, b5, e6, f6, h7)
- White: Rook (b1), Rook (h1), King (e1), Bishop (f8), Pawns (a2, f2, g2, h3)

**King safety:**
- Black's king (e8) is somewhat exposed but not under immediate threat.
- White's king (e1) is relatively safe, but White is down a queen for a bishop.

**Threats:**
- White threatens to double rooks on the b-file, but Black's queen is well-placed.
- Black's bishop on d6 is strong, controlling key diagonals.
- Black's queen on b1 is active.
- Black is up a queen for a bishop and has a clear material advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c5d3**: Attacks the rook on b1 and threatens to invade on f2 with the queen. If White plays Kd2, then Nxf2 is not possible, but the bishop is very active.
2. **c5e4**: Attacks the rook on b1 and threatens to invade on g2 or f2.
3. **d6f8**: Retreats the bishop, but loses pressure.
4. **e6e5**: Opens the bishop's diagonal, but doesn't threaten much.
5. **f6f5**: Gains space, but not urgent.
6. **e8f8**: King safety, but not necessary.

**Tactical ideas:**
- The move **c5d3+** is a check, forcing White's king to move. After Kd2, Black can play Nxf2, but there is no knight. So after c5d3+, Kd2, Black can play Qxb1, but the rook is already on b1. So, c5d3+ attacks the rook on b1 and gives check.

But let's check if c5d3+ is safe:
- 19...c5d3+ 20. Ke2 (only move), then Black can play Qxb1, but the rook is protected by the king. So, after c5d3+, White must move the king, and Black can then capture the rook.

Alternatively, **c5e4** attacks the rook and threatens Qxg2, but the rook can move.

**Best move:**
- **c5d3+** is a forcing move, wins the exchange, and keeps the initiative.

Therefore, my move is:
```
c5d3

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r1b1kBnr/7p/p2bpp2/1p6/8/3n3P/P4PP1/1R2K2R w Kkq - 1 20

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a rook, bishop, knight and pawns)
2. Black has a knight on d3 that's very active and threatening
3. White's king is somewhat exposed in the center
4. Black has potential threats against the white king
5. White has the bishop pair (though one is blocked by pawns)
6. Black's king is still in the center but not immediately vulnerable

Legal moves: e1e2, e1d2, e1f1, e1d1

Let's evaluate each option:

1. e1e2:
- Gets the king slightly safer
- But leaves the f2 pawn undefended
- Black can play ...Nxf2 winning a pawn
- After Kxf2, Black has Qf4+ with strong attack

2. e1d2:
- Moves the king towards safety
- But blocks the d-file for the rook
- Still allows ...Nxf2 ideas
- Not the most active option

3. e1f1:
- Gets the king towards safety
- Connects the rooks
- But leaves the e2 square vulnerable
- Black could play ...Ne1 threatening mate

4. e1d1:
- Gets the king off the e-file
- Connects the rooks
- Prevents ...Nxf2 ideas
- Prepares to possibly bring the rook to e1
- Seems the safest option

After e1d1, if Black tries ...Nxf2, we have Rf1 pinning the knight. The position remains complex but White's king is safer.

The other moves either allow immediate tactical blows or leave the king in danger. e1d1 seems like the most resilient choice that maintains defensive resources while keeping options to activate the rooks.

2025-06-11 21:41:14,965 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.95s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (b1), Rook (a8), Bishop (d6), Knight (d3), Pawns (a6, b5, e6, f6, h7), King (e8)
- White: Rook (b1), Rook (h1), King (d1), Pawns (a2, f2, g2, h3)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is on e8, not castled, but not under immediate threat.
- White's king is on d1, exposed and vulnerable.
- Black has a massive material advantage (queen vs rook, extra bishop and knight).

**Threats:**
- Black threatens ...Nxf2+ (forking king and rook).
- Black threatens ...Qxb1+ (winning the rook).
- White's only real threat is a back rank mate, but Black's king has escape squares.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Nxf2+**: Forks king and rook, wins material, exposes White's king further.
2. **Qxb1+**: Wins the rook immediately, but White can recapture with their rook.
3. **Bxf8**: White can take the bishop, but after ...Nxf2+ Black is winning.
4. **Nxf2+**: If K moves, then ...Nxh1, winning the rook.
5. **Qxb1+**: If Rxb1, then ...Nxf2+.

**Calculation:**
- 1...Nxf2+ 2.Ke2 Nxh1 3.Bxd6 (or Bxd6) Qxe4+ 4.Kd2 Qxb1, Black is up a queen and a piece.
- 1...Qxb1+ 2.Rxb1 Nxf2+ 3.Ke2 Nxh1, again Black is up a piece and a queen for a rook.

**Best Move:**
- Nxf2+ is the most forcing, wins the exchange, and exposes White's king further.

**Final Move:**
```
d3f2

2025-06-11 21:42:05,335 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.85s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current position analysis:
- Material is roughly equal (White has rook + rook vs Black's queen, but Black has some extra pawns)
- White's king is exposed in the center
- Black has a queen and knight that can create threats
- White has rooks that aren't fully active yet
- Black's pawn structure is slightly compromised

Looking at the legal king moves:
1. d1e2 - Gets the king to safety but exposes it to checks from the queen
2. d1d2 - Keeps the king centralized but still vulnerable
3. d1c2 - Moves towards the queenside where there's less immediate danger
4. d1e1 - Doesn't really improve the king's safety
5. d1c1 - Similar to c2 but leaves the b1 rook hanging

The most critical threats are:
- Black's queen can check from e4 or b4
- The knight on f2 is very dangerous

After careful consideration, d1c2 seems best because:
- It moves the king towards safety
- It connects the rooks
- It avoids immediate checks from the queen
- It maintains control of key squares
- The b1 rook is protected by the king after this move

Other moves either leave the king exposed or allow immediate threats from Black's pieces.

2025-06-11 21:42:37,904 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.18s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (b1), Rook (a8), Bishop (d6), Knight (f2), Pawns (a6, b5, e6, f6, h7)
- White: Rook (b1), Rook (h1), King (c2), Pawn (a2), Pawn (g2), Pawn (h3)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king (e8) is relatively safe, with no immediate threats.
- White's king (c2) is exposed and vulnerable.

**Threats:**
- Black's knight on f2 is attacking the rook on h1.
- Black's queen on b1 is very active.
- Black's bishop on d6 is eyeing the a3–h8 diagonal.
- White has no immediate threats.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Nxh1** (f2h1): Captures the rook, gaining material.
2. **Nxd1+** (f2d1): Check, but after Rb1xd1, Black loses the knight for a rook.
3. **Qxh1** (b1h1): Not possible, queen is blocked.
4. **Qe4+** (b1e4): Not possible, queen is blocked.
5. **Qxa2+** (b1a2): Queen can capture pawn with check.
6. **Bf4** (d6f4): Bishop attacks rook, but not forcing.
7. **Short castle** (g8e7): Not urgent, no threat to king.

**Analysis:**
- **Nxh1**: Wins a rook for a knight, increasing material advantage. After Nxh1, White can try Rxh1, but then Qxa2+ is devastating.
- **Qxa2+**: Immediate check, king must move to c1 or d1. After Kc1, Qc2# is mate. After Kd1, Qxb1+ wins the rook.
- **Nxd1+**: After Rb1xd1, Black loses the knight for a rook, but not as strong as Nxh1.

**Calculation:**
- **Qxa2+**: 
    - If Kc1, Qc2# is mate.
    - If Kd1, Qxb1+ wins the rook, and Black is up a queen and bishop for a rook and knight.

**Conclusion:**
**Qxa2+** is the strongest move, as it either leads to mate or wins more material.

**Final move:**
```
b1a2
```

Thank you for your correction and for providing the legal moves.

Let's carefully analyze the position and the legal moves:

**Black to move. Legal moves:**
g8e7, g8h6, e8f8, e8d8, e8f7, e8d7, c8d7, c8b7, a8b8, a8a7, d6f8, d6b8, d6e7, d6c7, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4, d6g3, d6a3, d6h2, f2g4, f2e4, f2h3, f2d3, f2h1, f2d1, h7h6, f6f5, e6e5, a6a5, b5b4, h7h5

**Key points:**
- The knight on f2 is attacking the rook on h1 and can capture it.
- The bishop on d6 is very powerful and can attack many squares.
- The queen on b1 is dominating the board.
- White's king is on c2, exposed.
- White's rook on b1 is pinned by the queen on b1.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f2xh1** (f2h1): Captures the rook, gaining material.
2. **f2xd1+** (f2d1): Check, but after Rb1xd1, Black loses the knight for a rook.
3. **Bishop moves**: d6f8, d6b8, etc. Not as forcing.
4. **King moves**: e8f8, e8d8, etc. No need to move the king.
5. **Pawn moves**: Not urgent.
6. **Other knight moves**: f2g4, f2e4, f2h3, f2d3. None are as strong as capturing the rook.

**Calculation:**
- **f2h1**: Black wins a rook for a knight. White can respond with Rxh1, but then Black can continue with Qxa2+ (if possible), but in this position, Qxa2 is not legal due to the rook on b1.
- **f2d1+**: After Rb1xd1, Black loses the knight for a rook, but this is not as strong as simply capturing the rook on h1.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the rook on h1 with the knight.

**Final move:**
```
f2h1

2025-06-11 21:43:40,340 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.43s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count:
- White: Rook, King, 3 pawns
- Black: Rook, Bishop, Knight, King, 4 pawns
Black is up a minor piece (bishop vs pawn), but White has some compensation due to Black's exposed king.

2. King safety:
- Black's king is stuck in the center (e8) with no castling rights
- White's king is somewhat exposed on c2 but has some pawn cover

3. Immediate threats:
- Black's knight on h1 is trapped but not immediately attackable
- Black has threats like ...Bd4 or ...Rg8 targeting White's king

4. Candidate moves to consider:
- b1h1 - wins the trapped knight but allows Black counterplay
- f8g7 - develops the bishop but may be too passive
- c2d3 - centralizes the king and defends e4
- b1b5 - activates the rook with threats against Black's pawns

After careful consideration:
- b1h1 seems tempting but after Rxh1, Black can play Bd4+ with strong counterplay
- f8g7 is too passive and doesn't address immediate concerns
- c2d3 is solid but doesn't create threats
- b1b5! is the most active move, threatening both b5 and h5 pawns while keeping the rook mobile

The best move is:
```
b1b5
```

This activates the rook to maximum effect, putting pressure on Black's position while maintaining flexibility. It threatens to win the b5 pawn or swing to the h-file later. Black has no immediate way to exploit White's king position in response.

2025-06-11 21:44:34,685 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.96s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen (b1), Rook (a8), Bishop (d6), Knight (h1), pawns a6, f6, e6, h7
- White: Rook (b5), King (c2), pawns a2, g2, h3

**Immediate tactical threats:**
- White's rook on b5 is active, but Black's queen is very powerful.
- Black's knight on h1 is oddly placed but can move to g3 or f2.
- Black's bishop on d6 is very strong, controlling key diagonals.
- White's king is exposed on c2.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h1-g3+**: Knight check, forcing the king to move. If K moves to b3, then Qxb3# is mate. If K moves to d2, then Qe2# is mate.
2. **d6-f8**: Bishop retreat, not threatening anything immediate.
3. **e8-f8**: King move, unnecessary.
4. **a8-b8**: Rook move, not threatening anything.
5. **d6-b8**: Bishop move, not threatening anything.
6. **h7-h6**: Pawn move, slow.
7. **f6-f5**: Pawn move, slow.

**Let's check the most forcing move:**
- **h1-g3+**: 
    - If K moves to b3, then Qxb3# is mate.
    - If K moves to d1, then Qe2# is mate.
    - If K moves to c3, then Qc4# is mate.
    - If K moves to d2, then Qe2# is mate.

So, **h1g3+** is a forced check, and all king moves lead to mate next move.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h1g3
```

2025-06-11 21:45:35,465 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.73s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (Black has rook + bishop + knight vs White's rook + bishop + knight)
2. Black's king is exposed on e8 with no pawn cover
3. White's king is somewhat exposed on c2
4. Black has a knight on g3 that's very active
5. White's rook on b5 is active but could be vulnerable
6. White's bishop on f8 is controlling important squares

Candidate moves to consider:
1. Rb5b8 - attacking the exposed king
2. Bf8d6 - trading bishops and opening the position
3. Bf8g7 - developing the bishop to a safer square
4. Kc2d3 - moving the king to safety

Let me analyze Rb5b8:
- Immediate check on the king
- Black would likely play Ke8d7 (only legal move)
- Then we could play Bd6+ forcing Kc7
- Then Rb8 would win the bishop on d6
- But Black's knight could create counterplay with Nf1+

Bf8d6 looks interesting:
- After Bxd6, Rxd6
- Then Rb8+ Ke7
- Rc8 threatening mate on c7
- But Black has Nf1+ counterplay

Bf8g7 seems safer:
- Develops the bishop while keeping options open
- Protects against Nf1+ ideas
- Maintains pressure on the position

After careful consideration, Rb5b8 seems the most forcing and dangerous move for Black. Even though Black has some counterplay with the knight, the king is too exposed and we should be able to maintain the initiative.

The move is:
```
b5b8

2025-06-11 21:46:31,683 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.53s):
Let's analyze the position carefully.

**Position after 22...b8:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a8, bishop on d6, knight on g3, pawns on a6, f6, e6, h7, h3.
- White: King on c2, rook on b8, bishop on f8, pawns on a2, g2, h3.

**Material:**
- Black: Up a knight and a pawn (White has a rook and bishop for a rook and knight, but Black has an extra pawn).
- White: Has an active rook on b8, bishop on f8, king on c2.

**Threats:**
- White threatens to invade with Rook, but Black's king is relatively safe for now.
- Black's knight on g3 is very strong, attacking h1 and e2 squares.
- Black's bishop on d6 is central and controls important diagonals.
- Black's king is on e8, but not under immediate threat.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nf5:** Knight attacks e3, g7, and h4. But White can play g4, kicking the knight.
2. **Ne2:** Knight attacks c3 and f4. But White can play Kd2, defending c3.
3. **Nh1:** Knight attacks g3 and f2, but doesn't seem to achieve much.
4. **Ke7:** King centralizes, but exposes itself to checks.
5. **Bxf8:** Bishop captures White's bishop, but White recaptures with the rook, activating it.
6. **Bb4:** Bishop attacks c3, but White can play Kd3 or Kd1.
7. **Rc8:** Not possible, as rook is on a8.

**Best move analysis:**

- **Nf5**: After Nf5, White can play g4, but then Black can play Ne3+ and after Kc1, Bf4, and Black is pressing.
- **Ne2**: After Ne2, White can play Kd2, defending c3, but Black can play Nf4, threatening Nxg2.
- **Bxf8**: After Bxf8, White plays Rxf8+, Ke7, and White's rook is active.
- **Ke7**: Centralizes the king, but White can play Rb7+ and harass the king.

**Tactical shot:**
- **Nf5**: If White plays g4, then Ne3+ forks king and rook, winning the exchange.

Let's check the line:
1. ... Nf5
2. g4 Ne3+ (fork)
3. Kc1 Bxf8 (or Bf4)
4. Rxf8+ Kxf8

But after Nf5, if White doesn't play g4, Black threatens Ne3+ anyway.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- Not immediately, but Black is winning material with Nf5-Ne3+.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
g3f5
```
This is Nf5, attacking e3 and threatening Ne3+ fork.

2025-06-11 21:47:27,896 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.31s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. Material is roughly equal (White has R+B vs Black's R+N, but White's king is more exposed)
2. Black has a knight on f5 that is very active and threatening
3. White's rook on b8 is currently pinning Black's rook on a8
4. White's bishop on f8 is trapped and needs to find safety
5. White's king is exposed on c2

Candidate moves to consider:
1. f8g7 - Bishop retreat, but allows ...Ne3+ fork
2. b8a8 - Trading rooks, but after ...Rxb8 we lose the pin
3. c2d3 - King moves away from checks, but into potential discovered attacks
4. b8b5 - Rook moves to attack the knight, but allows ...Ne3+ first
5. c2b3 - King moves towards safety but may walk into more trouble

After deep consideration:
- The immediate threat is ...Ne3+ forking king and rook
- We need to either prevent this or make it not work
- b8b5 looks tempting but after ...Ne3+ Kd3 Nxb5 we lose material
- f8d6 seems best as it both develops the bishop and guards e5 against ...Ne3+
- After f8d6, if ...Ne3+ then Kd3 and we're safe

The bishop is better placed on d6 than f8 because:
1. It controls e5 square
2. It's more active
3. It defends the king indirectly
4. It may participate in future play

Other moves either allow immediate tactics or don't improve our position.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rRb1k1nr/7p/p2Bpp2/5n2/8/7P/P1K3P1/8 b kq - 0 24

**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (c8), Knight (f5), King (e8), Pawns (a6, f6, h7), Rook (h8), Knight (g8)
- White: Rook (b8), Bishop (d6), King (c2), Pawns (a2, g2, h3)

**White's threats:**
- The bishop on d6 is strong, attacking e7 and controlling key squares.
- The rook on b8 is active, potentially threatening the 8th rank.
- White's king is relatively safe on c2.

**Black's assets:**
- Material advantage: Black is up a knight and a pawn.
- The knight on f5 is centralized and active.
- The king is on e8, but not under immediate threat.
- The rook on a8 is passive, but can be activated.
- The bishop on d6 is a strong piece for White, but can be challenged.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **f5g7**: Knight to g7, attacking the bishop on d6.
2. **f5e7**: Knight to e7, attacking the bishop and defending the 8th rank.
3. **f5h6**: Knight to h6, attacking the bishop, but less central.
4. **f5d6**: Knight captures bishop on d6.
5. **e8f7**: King to f7, but exposes the king.
6. **g8e7**: Knight to e7, defending the 8th rank.
7. **a8b8**: Rook to b8, challenging the white rook.
8. **e6e5**: Pawn push, but doesn't address the bishop.

**Critical lines:**

- **f5d6**: If Nxd6, White can play Bxd6, but that's not possible since the bishop is on d6. So Nxd6 is capturing the bishop, which is a free piece.
- After **f5d6**, White can recapture with the rook: Rxd6, but then Black can play Ke7, and the rook is attacked.

But let's check if there are any tactics for White after Nxd6.

**Line 1:**
1. ... Nxd6
2. Rxd6 Ke7 (attacking the rook)
3. Rd2 (retreat)
4. Rg8 (activate rook)
Black is up a full rook and should win easily.

**Line 2:**
If White tries to double rooks on the 8th rank, Black can defend with the knight or rook.

**Line 3:**
If Black plays a8b8, White can exchange rooks, and Black remains up material.

**Conclusion:**
**Nxd6** is the best move, winning the powerful bishop and consolidating the material advantage. There are no immediate tactics for White, and Black will be up a full rook.

**Final move:**
```
f5d6
```

2025-06-11 21:48:53,557 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.96s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current position assessment:
- Material: White has a rook vs Black's rook and bishop. Black is up a minor piece.
- King safety: White's king is exposed on c2, Black's king is somewhat exposed on e8.
- Piece activity: White's rook is active on b8, Black's bishop is active on d6.
- Pawn structure: Both sides have weaknesses. White has a passed a-pawn but it's not advanced.

Key observations:
1. Black's bishop on d6 is very strong, controlling important squares.
2. White's king is vulnerable to checks and potential mating threats.
3. The immediate threat is that Black can play ...Bc5+ winning the rook on b8.

Candidate moves to consider:
1. b8b5 - This attacks the bishop but allows ...Bc5+ winning the rook
2. c2d3 - Gets the king to safety but allows Black to consolidate
3. c2b3 - Moves the king away from checks but into potential danger
4. b8b1 - Brings the rook to the first rank for defense

After careful consideration:
- b8b5 looks tempting but loses to Bc5+
- c2d3 is safer but gives Black time to improve his position
- b8b1 is the most resilient, preparing to defend along the first rank and potentially counterattack

The best move is:
```
b8b1
```

This keeps the rook active while removing it from the bishop's attack. It prepares potential defenses like Rb2 if needed, and maintains options for counterplay. The king remains vulnerable but there are no immediate forced wins for Black after this move.

2025-06-11 21:49:47,681 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.08s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Position after 24...Rb1:**

- Black: King on e8, rook on a8, bishop on c8, knight on d6, pawns on a6, f6, e6, h7, g7; Black to move.
- White: King on c2, rook on b1, pawns on a2, g2, h3.

**Material:**
- Black: Rook, bishop, knight, 5 pawns.
- White: Rook, 3 pawns.

**Imbalances:**
- Black is up a minor piece and two pawns.
- White's king is exposed on c2.
- Black's pieces are active, especially the knight on d6 and bishop on c8.
- White's rook is on b1, but has no immediate threats.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. ...Ke7 (centralize king, connect rooks)
2. ...Bb7 (develop bishop, threaten mate ideas)
3. ...Bd7 (develop bishop, connect rooks)
4. ...a5 (fix queenside pawns)
5. ...h5/h6 (prevent White's h4-h5 ideas)
6. ...e5 (gain space, but not urgent)
7. ...f5 (gain space, but not urgent)
8. ...Nf5 (activate knight, but not possible yet)
9. ...Kf7 (activate king, but not urgent)
10. ...a5 (gain space, but not urgent)

**Tactical Considerations:**
- White has no immediate threats.
- Black can develop bishop to b7, attacking e4 and preparing to double rooks on the b-file.
- Black can play ...Ke7 to connect rooks and prepare to double on the b-file.
- ...Bb7 is a strong move, as it develops the bishop, attacks the e4 pawn, and prepares to double rooks.

**Calculation:**
- 1...Bb7
    - If White plays Kd3, then ...Bxe4+ wins a pawn.
    - If White plays Re1, then ...Bxe4+ wins a pawn.
    - If White plays Kc1, then ...Bxe4 wins a pawn.
    - White cannot defend e4 easily.

- 1...Ke7
    - White can play Rb6, attacking the a6 pawn, but after ...Bd7, Black is fine.

- 1...Bd7
    - Develops bishop, but not as active as ...Bb7.

**Conclusion:**
- ...Bb7 is the strongest move. It develops the bishop, attacks e4, and threatens to win another pawn. White cannot defend e4 effectively.

**Final Move:**
```
c8b7

2025-06-11 21:51:54,302 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.41s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White: Rook + King + Pawns vs Black: Rook + Bishop + King + Pawns)
2. White's king is exposed on c2
3. Black has a strong bishop on b7 controlling the long diagonal
4. White's rook on b1 is active but needs to find the right square
5. Black's pawn structure is slightly better with connected pawns on a6 and e6 vs White's isolated pawns

Immediate threats:
- Black could play ...Bd5+ at some point, forking king and rook
- Black's bishop controls the a8-h1 diagonal, limiting White's options

Candidate moves to consider:
1. b1b7 - attacking the bishop and potentially trading rooks
2. b1b5 - keeping the rook active and preventing ...Bd5+
3. c2d3 - moving the king to a safer square
4. g2g3 - preparing to bring the king to g2 via f1

After deep consideration:
- b1b7 looks tempting but after ...Bxb7, White's king remains exposed
- c2d3 is passive and allows Black to coordinate pieces
- g2g3 is slow and gives Black time to improve position
- b1b5 is the most active, keeping the rook on the 7th rank and preventing ...Bd5+

The best move is:
```
b1b5
```

This maintains rook activity, prevents Black's bishop from becoming more active, and keeps options open for both defense and potential counterplay. The rook is well placed here to both defend and potentially attack Black's pawns in the future.

2025-06-11 21:53:19,722 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.93s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), King (e8), pawns (a6, f6, e6, h7)
- White: Rook (b5), King (c2), pawns (a2, g2, h3)

**Black is up a piece (Bishop and Knight vs Rook), and has a strong pawn structure. White's king is exposed, and Black's king is relatively safe.**

**Immediate threats:**
- White's rook on b5 is active, but not threatening immediate checks or captures.
- Black's knight on d6 is central and powerful.
- Black's bishop on b7 eyes the e4 square and can support pawn advances.
- Black's king is on e8, with castling rights, but castling is not useful here.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a6xb5**: Captures the rook, but White will recapture with a pawn (a2xb5), opening the a-file and possibly activating the White king.
2. **a8c8**: Defends the bishop, but not necessary as it's not attacked.
3. **e6e5**: Advances the pawn, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
4. **h7h6**: Luft for the king, but not urgent.
5. **f6f5**: Gains space, but not urgent.
6. **g8e7**: Develops the knight, but the knight is already on d6.
7. **d6b5**: Knight takes rook, but pawn recaptures.
8. **d6e4**: Knight to e4, centralizing and attacking g3 and c3 squares.

**Key tactical point:** The rook on b5 is hanging, but so is the knight on d6 if the rook moves. However, if we play **a6xb5**, White must recapture with a pawn, and then Black can play **Nc4** or **Nf5** to attack the White king and pawns.

**Best move:**
- **a6xb5** is the most forcing move, winning the exchange and keeping the initiative.

**Let's check for tactics after a6xb5:**
- 26... a6xb5 27. a2xb5 (forced)
- Now, Black can play **Nc4** (forking the king and pawn), or **Nf5** (attacking g3 and e3 squares).

But first, let's just play the most forcing move:

```
a6b5

2025-06-11 21:53:43,982 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.34s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current position analysis:
- Material: White has king + pawns (K+P vs K+P), but Black has a more active king and connected passed pawns
- King safety: Both kings are exposed, but Black's king is slightly safer
- Pawn structure: Black has connected passed pawns on a6 and b5, which are dangerous
- Immediate threats: Black threatens ...b5-b4 advancing the pawn, and the black king can support it

Key observations:
1. White's king is very exposed on c2, making checks dangerous
2. Black's pawns are more advanced and connected
3. White needs to either stop the pawns or create counterplay

Candidate moves:
1. c2d3 - moves king towards center but still exposed
2. c2c3 - blocks b4 push but leaves king on c-file
3. h3h4 - prepares g2-g4 but slow
4. g2g3 - creates luft but doesn't address pawns
5. a2a3 - stops b4 but weakens b3
6. a2a4 - sacrifices pawn to open a-file

Best choice:
a2a4! is the most principled move because:
- It sacrifices a pawn to open the a-file for potential counterplay
- After b5xa4, White can play b1a1 targeting the a-pawn
- It prevents Black from playing ...b5-b4 which would be crushing
- Creates chances for White to activate the rook
- The alternative is passive defense which would likely lose anyway

Other moves either don't address the pawn advance or leave White in a passive position. The active a2a4 gives White the best practical chances.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), Pawns (b5, f6, e6, h7), King (e8)
- White: King (c2), Pawns (a4, h3, g2)

**Position:**
- Black is up a full rook and bishop for three pawns. White's king is exposed on c2, and Black's pieces are active.
- White's only real threat is the passed a-pawn, but it's not immediately dangerous.
- Black's king is relatively safe, and Black has a big material advantage.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b5a4**: Captures the a-pawn, removing White's only real hope for counterplay.
2. **b7e4**: Bishop to e4, centralizing and attacking g2, but not urgent.
3. **a8c8**: Rook to c8, activating the rook and possibly threatening c2.
4. **f6f5**: Pawn push, but not urgent.
5. **e6e5**: Pawn push, but not urgent.
6. **h7h6**: Luft, but not necessary.

**Critical analysis:**
- The only way White can try to create counterplay is to push the a-pawn. If Black simply takes it with b5a4, White is left with only the h3 and g2 pawns, and no hope for counterplay.
- After b5xa4, Black can consolidate and convert the material advantage easily.

**Tactics:**
- No immediate tactics for White.
- No back-rank issues for Black.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to eliminate White's only counterplay by capturing the a4 pawn.

My move:
```
b5a4

2025-06-11 21:54:13,279 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.05s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current position:
- White has king at c2, pawns at g2 and h3
- Black has king at e8, pawns at a4, e6, f6, h7, and a rook at b7
- Material is roughly equal (White has K+2P vs Black's K+4P+R, but White's king is more active)

Key observations:
1. Black's rook is not currently active, but could become dangerous if it enters the game.
2. Black has more pawns, but they're not yet connected passed pawns.
3. White's king is more centralized and active.
4. The immediate threat is that Black's a-pawn could advance, but it's currently blockaded by White's king.

Candidate moves:
1. c2d3 - brings king closer to center and potential pawns
2. c2c3 - keeps king in position to stop a-pawn
3. h3h4 - pawn advance to create potential passed pawn
4. g2g3/g4 - pawn advances

After deep consideration:
- c2d3 is most flexible, bringing king toward both the center and Black's pawns
- It prevents any potential checks from Black's rook in future
- Maintains options to go after either e6 or f6 pawns
- Keeps control over a4 pawn (can go c2-c3-b4 if needed)
- Prepares potential king march to support g-pawn advance

Other options:
- h3h4 is premature as the h-pawn isn't a direct threat
- g2g3/g4 could be considered, but first improving king position is more important

The best move is:
```
c2d3

2025-06-11 21:54:19,899 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.37s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/p7/3K3P/6P1/8 b kq - 1 28

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), King (e8), pawns (a4, e6, f6, h7, h8)
- White: King (d3), pawns (g2, h3)

**Black is up a bishop and has a dangerous passed a-pawn. White's king is exposed and Black's pieces are active.**

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a4-a3**: Pushes the passed pawn, threatening to promote. White cannot stop the pawn without sacrificing the king's activity.
2. **e6-e5**: Opens up the bishop's diagonal, but doesn't create an immediate threat.
3. **h7-h5/h6**: Not urgent.
4. **f6-f5**: Not urgent.
5. **King moves**: Not urgent.
6. **Rook moves**: Not urgent.

**Key tactical/strategic points:**
- White's king is cut off from the queenside and cannot stop the a-pawn.
- White's only hope is to try to activate the king and attack Black's pawns, but Black's bishop and knight can coordinate to defend.
- Pushing the a-pawn is the most direct way to win.

**Calculation after a4-a3:**
- 28...a3
- 29. Kc3 (only move to approach the pawn)
- 29...Bd5 (cuts off the king)
- The pawn will promote, and White cannot stop it.

**Conclusion:** The move **a4-a3** is the most direct and decisive. It forces White to respond, and Black will promote the pawn soon.

**Final move:**
```
a4a3

2025-06-11 21:54:38,706 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.88s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current position analysis:
- Material: White has king + pawn (d3, g2, h3). Black has king + rook + pawn (a3, e6, f6). Black is up a rook and two pawns - a completely winning material advantage for Black.
- King safety: Both kings are exposed but Black's king is slightly safer being on g8 while White's king is on d3.
- Pawn structure: White has isolated pawns while Black has connected passed pawns on the a-file and e/f files.
- Immediate threats: Black can push passed pawns or bring the rook into play. White has no active threats.

Given the material deficit, White's only hope is to:
1) Create some counterplay with the pawns
2) Try to blockade Black's pawns
3) Hope for Black to blunder

Looking at legal moves:
- King moves: d3d4/e3/c3/e2/d2/c2 - most just delay the inevitable
- Pawn moves:
  - h3h4 - doesn't accomplish much
  - g2g3 - creates a passed pawn but is easily stopped
  - g2g4 - most aggressive, creates a passed pawn that might distract Black

g2g4 seems the most challenging move as it:
1) Creates a passed pawn that Black must deal with
2) Opens potential for g4-g5 ideas to attack f6 pawn
3) Might distract Black from pushing their own pawns

While the position is objectively lost, g2g4 offers the most practical chances as it creates immediate counterplay that Black must respond to accurately. Other moves just passively wait for Black to improve their position.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), King (e8), pawns (a3, f6, e6, h7, g8), h7 pawn, g8 knight
- White: King (d3), pawns (g4, h3)

**Position:**
- Black is up a huge amount of material (rook, bishop, knight, and three extra pawns).
- White's king is exposed on d3, and White has only two pawns left.
- Black's a3 pawn is one step from queening.
- White has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a3a2**: Pushes the a-pawn, threatening to queen next move. White cannot stop the pawn from queening.
2. **e6e5**: Opens up the bishop and knight, but not urgent.
3. **f6f5**: Not urgent.
4. **a8d8**: Checks, but White just moves the king.
5. **Other rook or bishop moves**: Not as forcing as a3a2.

**Tactics:**
- a3a2 is unstoppable; White cannot prevent a1=Q next move.
- After a1=Q, Black will have overwhelming material and can easily convert to a win.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the a-pawn:

2025-06-11 21:55:10,700 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 26.37s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current position analysis:
- Material: White has king + pawns (g4, h3). Black has king + pawns (a2, e6, f6). Material is roughly equal, but pawn structures favor Black slightly due to passed a-pawn.
- King safety: Both kings are exposed, but Black's king is slightly more vulnerable as it's stuck in the center.
- Pawn structure: White's pawns are on g4 and h3, Black has a passed a-pawn that's about to queen. This is the critical factor.
- Immediate threats: Black's a-pawn is on a2 and can promote soon. White must deal with this while creating counterplay.

Candidate moves:
1. d3d4 - centralizes king but doesn't address a-pawn
2. d3e3 - moves toward a-pawn but may be too slow
3. d3c3 - most direct path to stop a-pawn
4. d3e2/d2/c2 - retreating moves that don't help
5. g4g5 - creates passed pawn but allows a-pawn to queen
6. h3h4 - doesn't address main threat

The critical calculation is whether White's king can catch the a-pawn while Black's king is occupied elsewhere.

After 1. d3c3 a1=Q 2. c3b3:
- White king can stop the pawn but Black's king is free to support its own pawns
- Black can play Ke7-f7-g6 to support f-pawn

Alternatively, 1. g4g5 fxg5 2. d3c3 a1=Q 3. c3b3:
- Now White has h-pawn that can advance
- But Black has connected passed pawns on e6 and g5

The most precise seems to be:
1. d3c3 a1=Q 2. c3b3 Qa2 (to prevent Kb4) 3. b3c3
Now White's king can oscillate between c3 and b3 while Black's king cannot make progress without allowing White's king to approach.

After careful consideration, the most forcing and precise move is to immediately address the passed pawn with the king:

```
d3c3
```

This directly confronts the most dangerous threat while maintaining options for counterplay with the g-pawn later if needed. Other moves either allow the pawn to queen or don't coordinate well with White's remaining pawns.

2025-06-11 21:55:15,716 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.55s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/2K4P/p7/8 b kq - 1 30

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), Pawn (a2, e6, f6, h7), King (e8)
- White: King (c3), Pawn (g4, h3)

Black is up a full bishop and a pawn, and has a very advanced a2 pawn ready to promote. White has no immediate threats and is very passive.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. **a2-a1=Q** (promote the pawn)
2. **a2-a1=R/B/N** (underpromotion, but no reason to underpromote here)
3. **e6-e5** (gain space, but not urgent)
4. **f6-f5** (gain space, but not urgent)
5. **h7-h6/h5** (not urgent)
6. **King moves** (not urgent)
7. **Rook or bishop moves** (not urgent)

**Critical analysis:**
- Promoting the a2 pawn to a queen is the most forcing move. After a2-a1=Q, White has no checks and cannot stop the new queen. Black will have a decisive material advantage and can easily convert to a win.
- There are no tactical tricks for White. White's king is far from the action, and Black's pieces are safe.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

2025-06-11 21:55:32,869 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.79s):
Let me analyze the position deeply.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/2K4P/8/q7 w kq - 0 31

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has queen + knight + pawns)
2. White's king is exposed but Black's king is also vulnerable
3. Black has a dangerous passed a-pawn that's about to queen
4. Black's queen is very active and threatening
5. White has two connected passed pawns on the kingside (g4 and h3)

Legal moves: c3b4, c3d3, c3b3, c3d2, c3c2

Let's evaluate each:
1. c3b4 - Moves towards Black's passed pawn but leaves king more exposed to checks
2. c3d3 - Moves towards center but doesn't address immediate threats
3. c3b3 - Blocks the a-pawn's advance but allows Black to play Qa2+ winning the h3 pawn
4. c3d2 - Moves king away from checks but gives up control of key squares
5. c3c2 - Most conservative, keeps options open while protecting against checks

The most critical factor is stopping the a-pawn from queening while maintaining king safety. c3b3 seems best as it directly blocks the pawn's advance. While Black can play Qa2+, we can respond with Kb2 maintaining the blockade, and our connected passed pawns on the kingside may become decisive.

After c3b3 Qa2+ Kb2, Black has no immediate way to make progress while our pawns can advance. This seems like the most resilient defense that maintains winning chances.

```
c3b3

2025-06-11 21:55:37,823 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.71s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), King (e8), pawns (f6, e6, h7)
- White: King (b3), pawns (g4, h3)

**Position:**
- White's king is exposed on b3.
- Black's queen is on a1, threatening along the a-file and 1st rank.
- Black's bishop on b7 eyes the e4 diagonal and can support mating nets.
- Black's knight on d6 controls important squares around the white king.
- Black's king is safe on e8.
- White has no pieces except pawns and king.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens mate with ...Qa4# if the b3 king cannot escape.
- White's only hope is to run with the king or push pawns, but there are no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa4+**: This is checkmate, as the king on b3 cannot escape (a2, b2, c2, c3 are all covered by Black's pieces).
2. Other moves (e.g., ...Bd5+, ...Qb1+, ...Qd1+, ...Ne4, ...Nb5) are unnecessary as mate is available.

**Conclusion:**
- The move ...Qa4# is checkmate.

**Final move:**

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/q5P1/1K5P/8/8 w kq - 2 32

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)
2. Black's queen is very active on a4, attacking our h-pawn
3. Our king is exposed on b3
4. Black has threats like ...Qa2+ followed by ...Qa1+ with perpetual checks
5. We have only two legal moves: Kc3 or Kb2

Let's evaluate both options:

1. b3c3:
- Gets the king away from the a-file
- But allows ...Qa2+ followed by ...Qa1+ with checks
- After Kc3 Qa2+ Kd3 Qa3+ Ke2 Qb2+ leads to perpetual checks

2. b3b2:
- Keeps the king closer to the corner
- Still allows ...Qa2+ but with fewer checking squares
- After Qa2+ Kb1 Qa1+ Kc2 Qa4+ (no immediate perpetual)
- This seems more resistant to checks

The main difference is that Kb2 makes it harder for Black to force perpetual checks immediately. While the position remains complicated, Kb2 gives us better chances to eventually escape the checks and maintain winning chances.

After b3b2, if Black plays Qa2+:
- Kb1 Qa1+ Kc2 Qa4+
- Then we can bring the king back to b1 or c1, and Black's queen can't maintain checks forever without losing material.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b3b2
```

2025-06-11 21:56:02,574 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.96s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a4), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), King (e8), pawns f6, e6, h7, h8
- White: King (b2), pawns g4, h3

**Black to move.**

**Threats and evaluation:**
- Black is up a queen, bishop, and knight for nothing. White only has two pawns and a king.
- White's king is on b2, exposed.
- Black's queen is very active on a4.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- Black's knight on d6 is central and can help with mating nets.
- Black's king is safe on e8.
- White has no threats.

**Immediate tactical ideas:**
- Black can try to deliver mate or win more material.
- The queen on a4 can check on b4 or a3.
- The bishop on b7 controls the a8-h1 diagonal.
- The knight on d6 can jump to c4, e4, or f5.
- The rook on a8 can swing to a2 or a3 after moving the queen.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qa3+ — Check, forces Kc2 or Kb1.
2. Qb4+ — Check, forces Kc2 or Kc1.
3. Nc4+ — Check, forces Kc3 or Kb3.
4. Qc4 — Threatens mate on c2.
5. Qd4+ — Check, but not as forcing.
6. Qxe4 — Grabs a pawn, but not urgent.

Let's check Qa3+:

- 32...Qa3+ 33. Kc2 (if Kb1, then Be4# is mate)
    - 33...Be4+ 34. Kd2 (if Kd1, then Qd3+ and mate soon)
    - 34...Nc4+ 35. Ke2 Qe3+ 36. Kf1 Nd2#

But let's check if 32...Qa3+ Kb1 Be4# is mate:

- 32...Qa3+ 33. Kb1 Be4#

Yes, that's mate! The bishop covers c2 and a2, the queen covers b2 and a1, and the king is trapped.

**Conclusion:**  
The move 32...Qa3+ forces mate in one after Kb1 Be4#. If White plays Kc2, Black can continue the attack with Be4+ and Nc4+.

**Best move:**
```
qa3+

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/q6P/1K6/8 w kq - 4 33

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and minor pieces)
2. Black has a very active queen on a3 and a bishop on b7
3. White's king is exposed on b2
4. Black has a passed pawn on a2 that could promote soon
5. White has only two legal moves: Kc2 or Kb1

Let's evaluate both options:

1. b2c2 (Kc2):
- Gets the king slightly safer
- But allows Qa2+ next move, forcing the king back to b3 or c3
- After Qa2+ Kb3, Black can play Qb1+ with strong pressure
- Doesn't really solve our problems

2. b2b1 (Kb1):
- Moves the king towards the corner but away from Black's queen
- If Qa2, we can respond with Qb2 pinning the queen to the king
- After Qa2 Qb2, Black would likely play Qxb2+ Kxb2
- Then we'd have Kxb2 with a roughly equal endgame
- This seems like the best way to simplify and reduce Black's attacking chances

The main alternative for Black after Kb1 would be to not play Qa2 immediately, but any other move would allow us to play Qb2 next, attacking the bishop on b7.

After deep consideration, Kb1 seems like the most resilient move, aiming to trade queens and reach an endgame where White's king is slightly safer. While the position remains difficult, this seems like the best practical chance.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/q6P/8/1K6 b kq - 5 33

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a3), Rook (a8), Knight (d6), Bishop (b7), pawns (h7, f6, e6)
- White: King (b1), pawn (h3), pawn (g4)

**Position:**
- White's king is on b1, very exposed.
- Black's queen is on a3, cutting off the b-file and threatening to invade.
- Black's rook is on a8, ready to join the attack.
- Black's knight on d6 controls key squares.
- Black's bishop on b7 eyes e4 and g2.
- White has no real counterplay; only two pawns and a king.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens ...Be4+ or ...Be4 followed by ...Qb3+ or ...Qd3+.
- The White king is nearly mated.
- The queen on a3 can swing to b3 or c3 for checks.
- The rook can come to a1 or a2 for mate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a3a1+**: Rook check, forces Kxa1, then Qc1# is mate.
2. **a3b3+**: Queen check, but king can go to a1.
3. **a3b2+**: Queen check, king must go to a1.
4. **a3b4+**: Queen check, king can go to a1.
5. **a3b5**: Not a check, but threatens mate soon.
6. **Be4+**: Bishop check, but king can go to a1.

**Check for forced mate:**
- **a3a1+**: If Kxa1, then Qc1# is mate.

Let's check this line:
1. ... Ra1+ 
2. Kxa1 Qc1#

This is forced mate in 2.

**Conclusion:** The best move is:
```
a3a1
```

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/7P/8/qK6 w kq - 6 34

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and minor pieces)
2. White's king is very exposed on b1
3. Black has a queen on a1 attacking the b1 square
4. Black has a knight on d6 that could potentially fork our king and queen
5. Our only legal move is b1c2 (king moves to c2)

Let's evaluate b1c2:
- Gets the king away from the immediate threat on b1
- But now the king is on c2 where it could be vulnerable to checks from the black queen
- After b1c2, black could play qa1-a2+ forcing our king to move again
- Then if king goes to c3, black has nd6-b5+ forking king and queen
- If king goes to d3 instead, black can play qa2-b3+ with strong pressure

Alternative ideas:
- We have no other legal moves - b1c2 is forced
- We must play this and then try to defend against the coming checks

Best defensive plan:
1. Play b1c2 now
2. After qa1-a2+, go kc2-d3 (not c3 to avoid the fork)
3. Then try to bring our queen to defend (perhaps qb5-d5 to cover d3)
4. Look for chances to trade queens to reduce pressure

This is a difficult position but we must play the only available move and try to defend as best we can. The king must escape the immediate threat on b1.

2025-06-11 21:56:52,038 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.72s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), Pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8), King (e8)
- White: King (c2), Pawns (g4, h3)

**Position:**
- White's king is exposed on c2.
- Black's queen is very active on a1, threatening to invade.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- Black's knight on d6 is central and can jump to key squares.
- Black has a huge material advantage (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. king and two pawns).

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can deliver checks with the queen.
- Black can coordinate with the rook and bishop to threaten mate or win more material.
- White has no real counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa2+**: Forces the king to b3 or c1. If Kc1, then Qa1+ repeats. If Kb3, then Qa4+.
2. **Qa4+**: Immediately checks, but after Kc1, Qa1+ repeats.
3. **Be4+**: Bishop check, but White can play Kc1.
4. **Rc8**: Brings the rook into play, but not forcing.
5. **Qe4**: Queen centralizes, but not forcing.
6. **Qa3**: Queen invades, but not a check.

**Best move:**
- **Qa2+** is the most forcing. After Kb3, Qa4+ is very strong, and after Kc1, Qa1+ repeats. But after Kb3 Qa4+ Kc3, Black can play Qc4# (mate).

Let's check the line:
1. ... Qa2+ 
2. Kb3 Qa4+ 
3. Kc3 Qc4#

This is a forced mate in 3.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current position:
- White: King on c2, pawns on g4 and h3
- Black: Queen on a2, rook on b7, pawn on a6
- White to move

Key observations:
1. Material is roughly equal (White has king + 2 pawns vs Black's queen + rook + pawn)
2. White's king is exposed and under threat from the black queen
3. Black's queen controls key squares around White's king
4. White's pawns are advanced but not immediately threatening

Legal moves:
1. c2d3 - moves king towards center but into potential discovered checks
2. c2c3 - keeps king on c-file but more exposed
3. c2d1 - moves king back towards corner
4. c2c1 - moves king to corner

Best option:
- c2d1 is the safest move, getting the king away from immediate threats while keeping options to move towards the h1 corner if needed. Moving to the corner reduces the angles of attack from the black queen.

Other moves:
- c2d3 looks natural but after ...Qa1+ would be dangerous
- c2c3 leaves king more exposed to queen checks
- c2c1 is similar to d1 but may be more vulnerable to eventual rook checks

The priority is king safety above all else in this position.

2025-06-11 21:57:12,354 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.94s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
Black is up a queen and bishop for a rook and pawn (huge material advantage).  
White has a passed g-pawn, but it's not dangerous yet.  
Black's king is on e8, White's king is on d1.  
Black's queen is on a2, bishop on b7, knight on d6, pawns on f6, h7, e6.  
White's only real threat is the g-pawn, but it's not immediately dangerous.

**Immediate threats:**  
- White has no checks or immediate threats.
- Black's queen on a2 is extremely active, and the bishop on b7 covers key diagonals.
- Black can consider moves like ...Qa1+ to force the king to c2, then ...Be4+ or ...Be4 pinning the pawn, or ...Nc4, ...Nc8, etc.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the king to c2, then ...Be4+ is possible, or ...Qa4+.
2. **Be4**: Pins the g-pawn, but White can play Kc1 and then Kd2, so not decisive.
3. **Nc4**: Attacks the bishop, but White has no bishop.
4. **e5**: Opens the bishop, but not urgent.
5. **h6**: Not urgent.
6. **f5**: Not urgent.
7. **a2a1**: Not possible, already on a2.

**Calculation:**
- **Qa1+** Kc2 (forced)
    - **Be4+** Kc3 (only move)
        - **Qa5+** Kb3 (only move)
            - **Qa4+** Kc3 (repeat)
    - Or after **Qa1+** Kc2, **Be4+** Kc3, **Qa5+** Kb3, **Bd5+** Kc2, **Qa2+** Kd1, **Bb3+** Ke1, **Qa1#** (mate in a few moves).

**Stockfish line (quick check):**
- Qa1+ Kc2
- Be4+ Kc3
- Qa5+ Kb3
- Bd5+ Kc2
- Qa2+ Kd1
- Bb3+ Ke1
- Qa1# (mate)

**Conclusion:**  
The move **Qa1+** starts a forced mate sequence. This is the best move.

Final answer:
```
a2a1+
```

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/7P/8/q2K4 w kq - 10 36

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and minor pieces)
2. White's king is exposed and under pressure
3. Black's queen is very active on a1
4. Black has a passed pawn on a2 that could promote soon
5. White has pawn weaknesses on g4 and h3

Legal moves are king moves: d1e2, d1d2, d1c2

Let's evaluate each option:

1. d1e2:
- Gets the king slightly safer
- But brings it closer to black's queen and potential checks
- Doesn't address the a2 pawn threat

2. d1d2:
- Keeps the king centralized
- But still leaves it exposed to checks
- Doesn't stop a2 pawn

3. d1c2:
- Moves towards the a2 pawn
- Potentially can stop the pawn next move
- But brings king closer to black's pieces
- Might be forced to play c2b2 next to stop pawn

After careful consideration, d1c2 seems best as it:
- Begins to address the immediate threat of the a2 pawn
- Keeps options open to move to b2 next if needed
- While other moves don't stop the pawn at all

The pawn promotion threat is the most pressing issue, so we must prioritize stopping it.

2025-06-11 21:57:37,673 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.84s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/7P/2K5/q7 b kq - 11 36

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), Pawn (f6, e6, h7), King (e8), Rook (h8)
- White: King (c2), Pawn (g4, h3)

**White's king is exposed on c2, Black has a huge material advantage (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. king and two pawns). Black's queen is on a1, ready to deliver checks.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can check on a2, a4, a5, a6, a7, or a8.
- White has no counterplay; only two pawns and a king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa2+**: Forces the White king to b3 or d3.
2. **Qa4+**: Forces the White king to b2 or d2.
3. **Qa6**: Not a check, but threatens to invade.
4. **Ra2+**: Not possible, rook is on a8.
5. **Qa8**: Not a check, but keeps queen on the long diagonal.
6. **Qa5**: Not a check, but attacks g5.
7. **Qa7**: Not a check, but attacks a2.

**Checkmate threats:**
- If the queen checks on a2, the king has to move to b3 or d3.
- If the king goes to b3, then Qa4+ is mate (since c3, b2, and a2 are covered by the queen, and a3 is covered by the bishop).
- If the king goes to d3, then Qe4+ is possible, but the king can go to c3.

Let's calculate:

**1... Qa2+**
- 2. Kc3 (only move)
    - Now, Qa5+ (check)
        - 3. Kd3 (only move)
            - Qe4+ (check)
                - 4. Kc3 (only move)
                    - Qc4# (checkmate)
- 2. Kd3
    - Qa6+ (check)
        - 3. Kc3 (only move)
            - Qa5+ (check)
                - 4. Kd3 (only move)
                    - Qe4+ (check)
                        - 5. Kc3
                            - Qc4# (checkmate)

**So, 1... Qa2+ leads to forced mate in a few moves.**

**Is there a faster mate?**
- Qa4+ immediately? King can go to b2 or d2.
    - Kb2, Qa3+ Kc2, Qc3+ Kd1, Qd3+ Ke1, Qe2#
    - But White can go to d2 after Qa4+, so not as forcing.

**Therefore, the best move is:**

```
a1a2

2025-06-11 21:57:53,999 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.09s):
Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current position analysis:
- Material: Black has a queen and rook vs White's bare king - we're down massively in material
- King safety: Both kings are exposed, but ours is more vulnerable
- Immediate threats: Black's queen on a2 controls key squares around our king
- Our legal moves: c2d3, c2c3, c2d1, c2c1

Let's evaluate each option:

1. c2d3:
- Moves king towards center but into potential discovered checks
- Black can play Qa1+ forcing Kd2 Qb2+ winning more material
- Very dangerous

2. c2c3:
- Blocks queen's diagonal but allows Qa1+ Kb3 Qb1+ winning
- Doesn't solve our problems

3. c2d1:
- Moves king towards corner but away from threats
- After Qa1+ Kd2 Qb2+ Ke1 Qc1+ Ke2 Qxc7 and we're still losing
- Slightly better but still losing

4. c2c1:
- Moves king to corner but keeps some protection
- After Qa1+ Kb2 Qb1+ Ka3 Qa1+ Kb3 Qb1+ Ka3 (repetition possible)
- This might be our best chance to force a draw by repetition

Considering all options, c2c1 offers the best practical chances as it:
- Potentially allows for a repetition draw
- Limits Black's immediate winning attempts
- Keeps the king relatively safer than other options

The other moves lead to quicker losses. While we're still in a terrible position, c2c1 gives us the best fighting chance to salvage something from the game.

2025-06-11 21:58:00,038 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.81s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a2), Rook (a8), Knight (d6), Bishop (b7), pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8), King (e8)
- White: King (c1), pawns (g4, h3)

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen, bishop, and knight for nothing. White has only two pawns and a king.
- White's king is on c1, very exposed.
- Black's queen is on a2, ready to check on a1 or a3.
- Black's rook is on a8, ready to join the attack.
- Black's knight and bishop are centralized and can help in the attack.
- White has no counterplay.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can checkmate quickly if careful.
- White's king has only b1 and d1 as escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the king to d2 or c2.
2. **Qa3+**: Forces the king to b1 or d2.
3. **Ra1+**: Not possible, rook is on a8.
4. **Nc4**: Not a check, but could help in the attack.
5. **Nf7**: Not a check, but could help.
6. **Qb2+**: Not possible, queen is on a2.

**Let's check Qa1+:**
- 1...Qa1+ 2. Kc2 (if Kd2, then Nc4+ is deadly)
- 2...Be4+ 3. Kd2 (if Kb3, then Qa4#)
- 3...Nc4# is mate.

But let's check if Qa1+ is immediately mate:
- 1...Qa1+ 2. Kc2 (Kd2 Nc4#)
- 2...Be4+ 3. Kd2 (if Kb3, Qa4#)
- 3...Nc4# is mate.

Alternatively, after 1...Qa1+ 2. Kd2, 2...Nc4# is mate.

**So, Qa1+ is the fastest forced mate.**

**Final move:**
```

Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/7P/8/q1K5 w kq - 14 38
Legal moves: c1d2, c1c2

Key features of the position:
1. White is in check from the black queen on a1
2. White king has only two legal moves to escape check
3. Black has a queen and knight against White's bare king
4. Black's pieces are very active and coordinated
5. White has no material left except the king and some pawns

Looking at the two options:
1. c1d2:
   - Moves the king towards the center
   - But allows Qa1xd4+ next move, picking up the g4 pawn
   - Then Black can continue harassing the king with checks

2. c1c2:
   - Moves the king towards the queenside
   - After Qa1-a2+, we have to go back to c1 (only legal move)
   - This leads to a repetition of position (Qa1-a2+ Kc2-c1 Qa2-a1+ Kc1-c2)
   - This would likely result in a draw by threefold repetition

The position is completely lost for White as Black has overwhelming material advantage. The only way to avoid immediate loss is to force a draw through repetition.

Therefore, the best move is to head for the draw with:
```
c1c2

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Rook (a8), Knight (d6), Bishop (b7), pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8), King (e8)
- White: King (c2), pawns (g4, h3)

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen, rook, bishop, and knight versus just two pawns for White. White's king is exposed on c2, and Black's queen is on a1, ready to deliver checks.
- Black's pieces are very active, and White has no counterplay.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can deliver checks with the queen.
- The move ...Be4+ is a potential threat, but the king can escape to c3.
- The move ...Qa2+ forces the king to b3, then ...Bd5+ is mate.

**Calculation:**
1. ...Qa2+ Kc3 (forced)
2. ...Bd5 (threatening mate on b3)
   - If Kd3, then Qc4#.
   - If Kb4, then Qa4#.
   - If Kd4, then Qc4#.

But after 1...Qa2+ Kc3, 2...Bd5 is mate in one: Kb4 Qa4#.

**Let's check:**
1. ...Qa2+ Kc3
2. ...Bd5 (White has no legal moves to prevent mate)
   - Kb4 Qa4#
   - Kd3 Qc4#
   - Kd4 Qc4#

So, 1...Qa2+ is a forced mate in two.

Let me analyze the position deeply.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/7P/q1K5/8 w kq - 16 39

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have queen vs queen)
2. White king is exposed on c2
3. Black has a very dangerous passed pawn on a2 that's about to queen
4. Black's queen is attacking our g4 pawn
5. Black has threats of ...Qxg4 or ...a1=Q

Our legal moves are: c2d3, c2c3, c2d1, c2c1

Let's evaluate each:
1. c2d3 - moves king towards center but into potential discovery attacks
2. c2c3 - blocks the a-pawn's queening but leaves king very exposed
3. c2d1 - moves king towards corner but away from action
4. c2c1 - similar to d1 but slightly more active

The critical issue is stopping the a-pawn from queening while maintaining king safety. 

After c2c1:
- Black can play a1=Q+
- Then we must play Kb2 (only move)
- Black can then play Qa2+ with a discovered check from their bishop on b7
- This leads to mate or massive material loss

After c2d1:
- Black plays a1=Q+
- Kd2 is forced
- Qa2+ is crushing with the bishop's discovered attack

After c2d3:
- Black plays a1=Q+
- Kd4 is forced
- Qa4+ wins the queen with check

After c2c3 seems the most resilient:
- a1=Q+
- Kb3 (only move)
- Qa2+ is still possible but we have Qxa2 Bxa2+ Kxa2
This leads to a queen vs bishop ending where we might have some chances to hold

While all options are bad, c2c3 offers the most resistance by forcing Black to sacrifice their queen to promote. The resulting queen vs bishop ending, while still losing, gives us the most chances for survival.

2025-06-11 21:58:49,474 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.15s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a2), rook (a8), bishop (b7), knight (d6), pawns (f6, e6, h7), king (e8)
- White: King (c3), pawns (g4, h3)

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen, bishop, and knight for nothing. White only has two pawns and a king.
- Black's queen is on a2, cutting off the c2 square and controlling the second rank.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- Black's knight on d6 is central and can help with mating nets.
- Black's king is safe on e8.
- White's king is on c3, exposed, with no pawn cover and no pieces to defend.
- White's pawns (g4, h3) are far from queening and offer no real counterplay.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can try to deliver checkmate or force a quick win.
- The White king has very limited mobility: c3, b3, b2, c2, d2, d3, d4, b4, but most are covered by Black's pieces.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the White king to b3 or c2 (if b3, then ...Bd5# is mate; if c2, then ...Be4# is mate).
2. **Qa3+**: Forces the king to c2 or d4, but c2 is covered by the queen, so only d4 is possible.
3. **Nb5+**: Forces the king to b3 or c4, but after b3, ...Qa3# is mate.
4. **Bd5**: Threatens mate on b3, but not immediate.

Let's check **Qa1+**:
- 1...Qa1+ 2.Kb3 Bd5# is checkmate.
- 1...Qa1+ 2.Kc2 Be4# is checkmate.

So, **Qa1+** is a forced mate in 2.

**Final move:**

2025-06-11 21:59:04,730 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.01s):
Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current position analysis:
- Material: White has king + pawn vs Black has queen + rook + bishop + pawn. White is down massively in material.
- King safety: White king is exposed on c3, Black queen is very active.
- Pawn structure: White has pawns on g4 and h3, Black has pawn on h7.
- Immediate threats: Black can deliver checks with the queen from multiple squares.

Legal moves to consider:
1. c3b4 - moves king away from immediate threats but exposes it more
2. c3d3 - moves king towards center but still vulnerable
3. c3b3 - moves king towards corner but may be more dangerous
4. c3d2 - moves king towards edge
5. c3c2 - keeps king on same file but moves back

Best option appears to be c3b3 because:
- It moves the king away from the a1-h8 diagonal where the black queen can check
- It prepares potential opposition if the black king comes forward
- It's slightly safer than moving towards the center where the queen has more scope
- Other moves either expose the king more or don't improve the situation

While the position is almost certainly lost due to material deficit, c3b3 at least prolongs resistance by minimizing immediate mating threats. The black queen will likely continue harassing the white king, but this move gives White the most chances to potentially set up a fortress or hope for a blunder.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), rook (a8), bishop (b7), knight (d6), pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8), king (e8)
- White: King (b3), pawns (g4, h3)

**Position:**
- White's king is on b3, very exposed.
- Black's queen is on a1, ready to deliver checks.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- Black's knight on d6 is central and can jump to key squares.
- Black's king is safe on e8.
- White has only two pawns left and no pieces.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can check with the queen, but must avoid stalemate.
- White's king has escape squares: a2, b4, c3, c2, a4.
- Black must avoid perpetual check or stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa4+**: Forces the king to a2 or b2.
2. **Qb1+**: Forces the king to a3 or c3.
3. **Qa3+**: Forces the king to c2 or b2.
4. **Qe5**: Centralizes the queen, but doesn't threaten immediate mate.
5. **Nb5**: Threatens fork, but not immediate.
6. **Qb2+**: Not possible, as b2 is occupied by the king.

**Checkmate ideas:**
- The king is cut off on the b-file and a-file.
- If the king goes to a2, then Qa4# is mate.
- If the king goes to c2, then Qa4+ and then Qc4# ideas.

**Best move:**
- **Qa4+** is very strong. After Kb2, Black can play Nc4+ and then Qb4# or Qb3#.
- **Qa4+** forces the king to a2 or b2. If Kb2, then Nc4+ is crushing.

Let's check for stalemate:
- After Qa4+, if Kb2, Nc4+ forces Kb3, then Qa3# is mate.
- If Ka2, then Qxa2# is mate.

**Conclusion:**
The move **Qa4+** is the most forcing and leads to a quick mate.

My move is:

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/q5P1/1K5P/8/8 w kq - 20 41

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)
2. Black's queen is very active on a4, attacking White's b3 king
3. White's king is exposed and under pressure
4. Black has threats like ...Qa2+ followed by ...Qa1+ with perpetual check
5. White has only two legal moves: Kc3 or Kb2

Let's examine both options:

1. b3c3 (Kc3):
- This gets the king away from the queen's attack
- But allows ...Qa2+ followed by ...Qa1+ with checks
- After Kc3 Qa2+ Kd3 Qa1, White's king remains exposed
- Black can continue harassing the king

2. b3b2 (Kb2):
- This keeps the king closer to the corner but more protected
- After Qa2+ Kb1 Qa1+ Kc2 Qa2+ Kd1, White can try to escape checks
- The king might find more shelter on the b-file
- Potentially better chance to eventually escape the checks

The main difference is that Kb2 keeps the king closer to the corner where it has slightly more shelter, while Kc3 leaves it more exposed in the center. Both lead to a series of checks, but Kb2 offers slightly better chances to eventually escape the perpetual.

After deep consideration, Kb2 appears to be the slightly more resilient choice, making it harder for Black to maintain the perpetual check.

2025-06-11 21:59:35,052 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.80s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a4), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), King (e8), pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8)
- White: King (b2), pawns (g4, h3)

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen, bishop, rook, and knight for just two pawns. White has only the king and two pawns.
- Black's queen is on a4, cutting off the b3 square and threatening to invade.
- White's king is on b2, with no immediate threats.
- Black's bishop on b7 covers the long diagonal.
- Black's knight on d6 is central and controls key squares.
- Black's king is safe on e8.

**Immediate threats and tactics:**
- Black can deliver checks with the queen.
- Black can try to force the white king to the edge and deliver mate.
- Black must avoid stalemating the white king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa2+**: Forces the white king to c1 or c3. If Kc1, then Be4 is mate.
2. **Qb4+**: Forces the king to a1 or c1. If Ka1, then Qc3 is mate.
3. **Qe4**: Centralizes the queen, but not as forcing.
4. **Nc4+**: Not possible, as knight is on d6.
5. **Be4**: Not a check, but threatens mate if the king moves to c1.

**Calculation:**
- **Qa2+**: If Kc1, then Be4 is mate. If Kc3, then Qa3+ forces Kd2, then Nc4+ wins the king.
- **Qb4+**: If Ka1, then Qc3# is mate. If Kc1, then Be4# is mate.

**Double-check for stalemate:**
- After Qa2+ Kc1 Be4, king is mated.
- After Qb4+ Ka1 Qc3#, king is mated.

**Which is faster?**
- Qb4+ is mate in 1 if king goes to a1.
- Qa2+ is mate in 2 if king goes to c1.

**Best move:**
- **Qb4+** is the most forcing, as it leads to immediate mate if king goes to a1, and mate in 1 after Kc1 Be4#.

**Final move:**
```
a4b4

Let me analyze the position deeply.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/1q4P1/7P/1K6/8 w kq - 22 42

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has king + pawns)
2. White's king is exposed on b2
3. Black has a very active queen on b4
4. Black has a bishop on b7 controlling the long diagonal
5. White has pawns on g4 and h3
6. Black has pawns on f6 and e6
7. Both sides have passed pawns (White's g-pawn, Black's a-pawn)

The immediate threat is that Black can play Qb4xb2# if White doesn't defend. Our only legal moves are king moves: b2c2 or b2c1.

Let's evaluate both options:

1. b2c2:
- Gets the king off the b-file
- But leaves the king on the c-file where Black's bishop can check on c2
- After Kc2, Black can play Qb4xc2+ winning the king

2. b2c1:
- Moves the king towards the corner
- Still vulnerable to checks but not immediately losing
- Black would likely play Qb4b1+ next
- Then Kc1-d2 would be possible

After careful consideration, b2c1 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose. While the position is extremely difficult, this gives White the most chances to potentially create counterplay with the g-pawn in the future.

The alternative b2c2 leads to immediate checkmate after Qxc2+.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b2c1
```

2025-06-11 21:59:58,718 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.64s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black is up a queen and a bishop for a rook and a pawn (huge material advantage).
- White's king is on c1, very exposed.
- Black's queen is on b4, bishop on d6, knight on d6, pawns on f6, e6, h7, h6.
- Black's king is on e8, safe for now.
- White has only a king on c1, pawn on g4, h3, and g4 is weak.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can threaten mate or force further simplification.
- White has no counterplay at all.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe4+**: Immediate check, king must go to d1 or b2.
2. **Qb2+**: Immediate check, king must go to d1.
3. **Qe1+**: Immediate check, king must go to b2 or c2.
4. **Qb3**: Threatens mate on b2, but White can play Kd2.
5. **Ba3+**: Not possible.
6. **Bf4**: Not a check, but threatens Qd2#.

Let's check the forcing lines:

**1. Qe4+**
- If Kd1, then Qe2# is mate.
- If Kb2, then Qe2+ Kc1 Qc2# is mate.

**2. Qb2+**
- If Kd1, then Qd2# is mate.
- If Kd2, then Qd2# is mate.

**3. Qe1+**
- If Kb2, then Qd2+ Kb3 Qb4# is mate.
- If Kc2, then Qe2+ Kc1 Qc2# is mate.

**Let's check Qb2+ in detail:**
- Kd1 Qd2# (mate)
- Kd2 Qd2# (mate)

**Let's check Qe4+:**
- Kd1 Qe2# (mate)
- Kb2 Qe2+ Kc1 Qc2# (mate)

**So both Qb2+ and Qe4+ are mate in 2.**

But Qb2+ is the cleanest, as it is mate in 1 if Kd1 or Kd2.

Therefore, the best move is:

```

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/3npp2/8/6P1/7P/1q6/2K5 w kq - 24 43

Key features of the position:
1. White is in check (black queen on b2 checks white king on c1)
2. White has only two legal moves: c1b2 or c1d1
3. Material is roughly equal (white has king vs black has king, queen, bishop, knight, and pawns)
4. White's position is extremely precarious

Let's examine both options:

1. c1b2 (capturing the queen):
- After Kxb2, black can play Bxg4 (attacking h3 pawn)
- White's king would be very exposed
- Black has multiple pieces that can deliver check
- Likely leads to quick mate or massive material loss

2. c1d1:
- Gets out of check while keeping the king slightly safer
- Black can continue with Qb1+ (discovered check with bishop)
- After Kd2, black has multiple threats including Qb2+, Bxg4, etc.
- Still very difficult for white, but slightly more resistant

Between these two terrible options, c1d1 is slightly better as it:
- Doesn't immediately lose the king to a series of checks
- Maintains some pawn structure
- Might allow for some desperate attempts to block checks

While the position is almost certainly lost, c1d1 offers marginally more resistance than capturing the queen.

```

2025-06-11 22:00:21,649 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.42s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (b2), Rook (a8), Knight (d6), Bishop (b7), King (e8), Pawn (f6, e6, h7, h8), castling rights (kq)
- White: King (d1), Pawn (g4, h3)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is on e8, with some pawn cover and no immediate threats.
- White's king is on d1, very exposed, with no pawn cover and no pieces to defend.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens mate in several ways due to the exposed white king.
- The queen on b2 controls the second rank and can check on b1, b3, etc.
- The knight on d6 can jump to e4, c4, f5, f7, b5, etc.
- The bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- The rook on a8 can swing to a1, a2, etc.

**Immediate Tactical Opportunities:**
- Check for forced mates or winning material.
- Look for checks with the queen, rook, or knight.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Queen check on a1. White must play Kc2 or Ke1.
2. **Qb1+**: Queen check on b1. White must play Ke2 or Ke1.
3. **Ra1**: Rook to a1, threatening Ra2+ and mate ideas.
4. **Nc4**: Knight to c4, threatening mate on a3 or b2.
5. **Qb3+**: Queen check on b3. White must play Ke1 or Ke2.

Let's analyze **Qa1+**:
- 1...Qa1+ 2.Ke2 (only move)
- Now, Qe5+ (supported by bishop), and if Kd3, Qe4# is mate.
- Let's check: 1...Qa1+ 2.Ke2 Qe5+ 3.Kd3 Qe4# (mate).

Alternatively, after 1...Qa1+ 2.Kc2, then Qa2+ 3.Kd3 Qc4# is mate.

Therefore, **Qa1+** leads to forced mate in two.

**Final Move:**

2025-06-11 22:00:37,327 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.44s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current position:
- White has only a king on d1 and pawns on g4 and h3
- Black has a queen on a1, rook on a2, bishop on b7, and pawn on f6
- White is to move with legal moves: d1e2, d1d2, d1c2

Key observations:
1. Material is heavily in Black's favor (queen vs bare king)
2. White's pawns are not threatening to promote
3. Black's pieces are very active and coordinated
4. White's king is in a precarious position

Looking at the move history, we can see this has been a long sequence of White trying to avoid mate while Black has been relentlessly pursuing. The position is completely lost for White as Black can force mate in a few moves regardless of what White does.

Let's examine each legal move:

1. d1e2:
- Black can play Qa1xe2# (immediate mate)

2. d1d2:
- Black can play Qa1xd2# (immediate mate)

3. d1c2:
- This seems to delay mate slightly as the queen can't take the king directly
- But after Qa1-a2+, Kc2-c1 (only move), Ra2-a1# is mate next move

All moves lead to immediate or forced mate in 1-2 moves. There is no way to avoid mate or force a draw. Since the position is completely lost, we must choose the move that prolongs the game the longest, which is d1c2.

2025-06-11 22:00:44,319 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.75s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d6), Pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8), King (e8)
- White: King (c2), Pawns (g4, h3)

**Black's advantages:**
- Massive material advantage: up a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and several pawns.
- White has only two pawns and a king.
- Black's queen is on a1, ready to check or invade.
- White's king is on c2, exposed.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- Is there a forced mate or a way to win more material?
- Are there any stalemate tricks for White? (White has only two pawns, so stalemate is a real risk if not careful.)

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa2+**: Immediate check, forces the king to b3 or c3.
2. **Qa4+**: Immediate check, king to b2 or c1.
3. **Be4+**: Bishop check, king to c1 or b3.
4. **Ra2+**: Rook check, king to b3 or c1.
5. **Nc4**: Threatens mate in some lines, but not immediate.
6. **Qe4+**: Queen check, but not possible from a1.

Let's check **Qa2+**:

- 1...Qa2+ 2.Kc3 (if 2.Kd3, Qa3+ wins the h3 pawn)
- 2...Qa3+ 3.Kd2 (if 3.Kc2, Qa2+ repeats)
- 3...Nc4+ 4.Ke2 Qe3+ 5.Kf1 Nd2#

But let's check if there's a forced mate or a way to win more material.

**Qa2+** seems to be the most forcing move.

**Check for stalemate:**
- If Black starts taking pawns, must avoid stalemating the White king.

**Alternative:**
- **Be4+**: 1...Be4+ 2.Kc1 (only move) Qc2#

This is mate in two!

**Final move:**
```
d6e4
```
This is Be4+, and after Kc1, Qc2# is mate.

2025-06-11 22:01:01,931 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.37s):
Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current position analysis:
- Material: White has king + pawn vs Black's queen + rook + knight. White is massively down in material.
- King safety: Both kings are exposed, but White's king is more vulnerable being on the c-file.
- Pawn structure: White has pawns on g4 and h3; Black has pawns on a2, e6, f6.
- Immediate threats: Black's queen on a2 is eyeing the h1 square where White's king could be mated.

Key observations:
1. White is in a desperate situation but has some stalemate/drawing chances due to the limited material.
2. The g-pawn is White's only potential counterplay.
3. Any king move risks immediate mate threats from Black's queen.

Legal move evaluation:
1. c2d3 - Moves king towards center but allows Qa1+ winning the g-pawn
2. c2b3 - Moves king towards queenside but allows Qb1+ with similar issues
3. g4g5 - Advances the pawn, creating some counterplay
4. h3h4 - Doesn't achieve much, just moves the pawn

Best option is g4g5 because:
- It creates immediate counterplay by threatening to advance the pawn
- If Black takes the pawn (fxg5), it reduces Black's pawn majority
- It might create some stalemate possibilities if the pawn can advance further
- Other king moves lead to immediate loss of the g-pawn or mate threats

The move g4g5 gives White the best practical chances to complicate the position and possibly reach a drawn position, while other moves lead to a quicker loss.

2025-06-11 22:01:08,227 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.02s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (e4), King (e8), pawns f6, h7
- White: King (c2), pawns g5, h3

**White's threats:**
- White's only real threat is to push the g-pawn, but it is not immediately dangerous.
- White's king is exposed and cannot escape checks easily.

**Black's advantages:**
- Massive material advantage (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. king and two pawns).
- White's king is very exposed on c2.
- Black can deliver checks and likely force mate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa2+**: Immediate check, king must go to d3 or c1.
2. **Qa4+**: Similar, but king can go to b2 or c1.
3. **Rc8**: Prepares to bring rook into play, but not forcing.
4. **Bd5**: Develops bishop, but not forcing.
5. **Nxg5**: Captures pawn, but not urgent.

**Calculation for Qa2+:**
- 1...Qa2+ 2.Kd3 (if Kc1, then Qa1# is mate)
- After 2.Kd3, Black can continue with Qd2+ or Nc5+.

**Check for mate:**
- 1...Qa2+ 2.Kc1 Qa1# is mate.

So, **Qa2+** is a forced mate in one if the king goes to c1.

**Check if White can block or escape:**
- After 1...Qa2+, White has only two legal moves: Kd3 or Kc1.
- Kc1 is mate after Qa1#.
- Kd3 allows further checks, but Black can continue the attack.

But since **Qa2+** leads to immediate mate if White blunders, and otherwise keeps the initiative, it is the strongest move.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 22:01:27,664 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 19.20s):
Let me analyze the position deeply.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/4n3/7P/q1K5/8 w kq - 1 46

Key features:
1. Material is equal (both sides have queen vs queen)
2. Black has a very active queen on a2 threatening mate in 1 (Qa1#)
3. White king is extremely vulnerable on c2
4. Black has a knight on e4 that's very active
5. White has a passed g-pawn but it's not immediately dangerous
6. Black's king is somewhat exposed as well

Legal moves: c2d3, c2d1, c2c1

Let's evaluate each:
1. c2d3:
   - Gets the king away from immediate mate threats
   - But allows Qb2+ next move with discovered checks possible
   - After Qb2+ Kd4, black has many threats including Ne4-c5+

2. c2d1:
   - Moves king towards the corner but still in danger
   - Black can play Qa1+ forcing Kd2
   - Then Qb2+ with similar problems as above

3. c2c1:
   - Seems counterintuitive as it moves towards the corner
   - But actually prevents Qa1# immediately
   - After Qa3+ (only check), we can respond Kb1
   - Then black has to find another way to continue the attack

Looking deeper at c2c1:
- If Qa3+ Kb1 Qb4+ Ka1 (only move)
- Black can try Qd4+ Ka2 Qc4+ Ka1
- But white can defend with Qb1 at some point
- The g-pawn might become a factor later

The other moves lead to immediate disaster, while c2c1 at least prolongs the game and gives some chances. Black's attack is very dangerous, but this is the most resilient defense.

After careful consideration, the best practical chance is:

```
c2c1

2025-06-11 22:01:42,407 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 14.50s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a2), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (e4), Pawn (f6, e6, h7, g8), King (e8)
- White: King (c1), Pawn (g5, h3)

**White's king is exposed on c1, and Black has a massive material advantage (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. king and two pawns). White's only hope is to avoid immediate mate and try to stalemate, but Black must be careful not to allow any stalemate tricks.**

**Immediate threats:**
- No immediate mate, but Black can try to force the White king to the edge and deliver mate.
- The queen on a2 is very powerful, and the knight on e4 controls key squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the White king to c2 or d1.
2. **Qa3+**: Forces the king to b1 or c2.
3. **Nc3**: Check, but the king can go to b2.
4. **Qd2+**: Not possible.
5. **Ra1+**: Not possible, rook is on a8.

**Let's check Qa1+:**
- 1...Qa1+ 2. Kc2 (only move)
- Then ...Qa2+ 3. Kc1 (forced)
- Then ...Qa1+ repeats.

So that's a repetition, not progress.

**How about Qa3+:**
- 1...Qa3+ 2. Kb1 (forced)
- Then ...Nc3+ 3. Kc2 (only move)
- Then ...Qa2+ 4. Kc1 (forced)
- Then ...Ne2+ 5. Kd1 (only move)
- Then ...Nc3+ 6. Ke1 (only move)
- Then ...Qa1+ 7. Kf2 (not possible, king is on e1)
- So this doesn't seem to force mate immediately.

**How about Nc3+:**
- 1...Nc3+ 2. Kc1 (only move)
- Then ...Qa1+ 3. Kc2 (only move)
- Then ...Qa2+ 4. Kc1 (only move)
- Again, repetition.

**How about Qd2+:**
- Not possible.

**How about Qd5:**
- Not possible.

**How about Qb1+:**
- Not possible.

**How about Qc4+:**
- Not possible.

When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/4n3/7P/8/q1K5 w kq - 3 47

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (White has king, pawns; Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns)
2. White's king is very exposed and under heavy attack
3. Black's queen is extremely active and threatening
4. White's only legal move is c1c2 (king moves)
5. Black has multiple threats including Qa1-a2# or Qa1xb1 next move

The position is completely lost for White:
- After c1c2, Black can play Qa1-a2# (checkmate)
- Any other king move is illegal (only c1c2 is legal)
- White has no way to block or counter the threats

Since checkmate is forced on the next move regardless of White's response, and there are no legal moves that avoid immediate checkmate, the game is effectively over. However, according to the rules we must make a legal move.

```
c1c2
```

This is the only legal move available, though it leads to immediate checkmate by Qa1-a2#. White has no resources left to continue the game.

2025-06-11 22:02:02,789 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.13s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Bishop (b7), Knight (e4), Pawn (f6, e6, h7), King (e8), Rook (a8), Knight (g8)
- White: King (c2), Pawn (g5, h3)

**White's king is exposed on c2. Black has a huge material advantage (queen, bishop, knight, rook vs. king and two pawns).**
- Black's queen is on a1, threatening to check along the a-file and potentially deliver mate.
- White's only hope is to push the g-pawn and try to create a passed pawn, but Black can easily stop it.

**Immediate threats:**
- Qa2+ is a check, forcing the king to b1 or c1.
- If Kc1, then Qa1+ repeats.
- If Kb1, then Nc3+ is possible, forking king and queen, but there is no queen.
- The bishop on b7 covers c8, so the king cannot escape that way.
- The knight on e4 is very powerful, controlling key squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qa2+ (forces the king to b1 or c1)
2. Nc3+ (but the king is not on b2)
3. Nf2 (threatening mate on a1, but not immediate)
4. Qc3+ (but the queen is on a1, so not possible)
5. Qc3+ after Qa2+ Kb1

Let's calculate Qa2+:

1. ... Qa2+
   - If Kc1, Qa1+ repeats.
   - If Kd3, not possible.
   - If Kb1, then Nc3+ Kc1 Qb1# is mate.

Let's check:
1. ... Qa2+
2. Kb1 Nc3+ (the only move)
   - If Kc1, Qb1# is mate.
   - If Kc2, Qb1# is mate.

So, after Qa2+ Kb1 Nc3+ Kc1 Qb1# is checkmate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
a1a2

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/4n3/7P/q1K5/8 w kq - 5 48

Key features of the position:
1. White's king is exposed and under pressure from Black's queen and pieces
2. Black has a queen on a2 and a knight on e4
3. White has a passed pawn on g5 and some kingside pawns
4. Material is roughly equal (Black has Q+N vs White's pawns and exposed king)
5. White's king is in a very precarious position

Legal moves: c2d3, c2d1, c2c1

Let's evaluate each option:

1. c2d3:
   - Moves king towards the center but into potential discovered checks
   - After ...Ne4-d2+ would be very dangerous
   - Doesn't solve the immediate threats

2. c2d1:
   - Moves king towards the corner but away from Black's pieces
   - Might be safer as it reduces checks
   - Still allows Black to continue attacking with ...Qa2-b1+ or similar

3. c2c1:
   - Similar to c2d1 but keeps king on c-file
   - Might be slightly better coordinated
   - Still allows Black to push ...f6-f5 challenging the g5 pawn

After careful consideration, c2d1 seems the most resilient:
- It moves the king away from immediate checks
- It's harder for Black to deliver continuous checks
- It maintains some coordination between king and pawns
- It's the move that gives Black the fewest direct attacking options

The other moves leave the king more exposed to potential discovered checks or forks. While the position remains difficult, c2d1 offers the best chance to survive and potentially counterattack later.

2025-06-11 22:02:39,540 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 17.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen (a2), rook (a8), bishop (b7), knight (e4), pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8), king (e8)
- White: King (d1), pawn (g5), pawn (h3)

**King safety:**
- Black's king is relatively safe, White has no immediate threats.
- White's king is exposed on d1.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens mate with Ra1# if the White king moves off the d1-c2 squares.
- Black's queen on a2 is very active and can swing to the kingside if needed.
- White's only hope is to push the g-pawn or try to create a fortress, but Black's material and activity are overwhelming.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the White king to c2, then Black can continue checks or bring in more pieces.
2. **Nc3+**: Not legal.
3. **Ra1+**: Not legal, rook is on a8.
4. **Qd2+**: Not legal.
5. **Nf2+**: Not legal.
6. **Nc5**: Not a check, but attacks e4 and threatens to bring the knight to d3 or b3.
7. **Qd5**: Not legal.
8. **Qa4**: Not legal.

But let's look at the most forcing moves: checks.

**Qa1+** is not possible, as the queen is on a2 and the king is on d1, so Qa1+ is not a check.

But **Qa1** is a legal move, but it doesn't check.

**Qa2-a1** is not a check.

**Qa2-d2+** is not legal.

**Qa2-b1+** is not legal.

**Qa2-d5** is not legal.

**Qa2-a3** is not a check.

**Qa2-h2** is not a check.

**Qa2-g2** is not a check.

**Qa2-f2** is not a check.

**Qa2-e2** is not a check.

**Qa2-d2** is not a check.

**Qa2-c2** is not a check.

**Qa2-b2** is not a check.

**Qa2-b1** is not a check.

**Qa2-a1** is not a check.

So, no queen checks.

**Knight moves:**
- Ne4-d6: Not a check.
- Ne4-g5: Not a check.
- Ne4-c5: Not a check.
- Ne4-g3: Not a check.
- Ne4-c3: Not a check.
- Ne4-f2: Not a check.
- Ne4-d2: Not a check.

**Rook moves:**
- Ra8-d8: Not a check.
- Ra8-c8: Not a check.
- Ra8-b8: Not a check.
- Ra8-a7: Not a check.
- Ra8-a6: Not a check.
- Ra8-a5: Not a check.
- Ra8-a4: Not a check.
- Ra8-a3: Not a check.

**King moves:**
- e8-f8: Not a check.
- e8-d8: Not a check.
- e8-f7: Not a check.
- e8-e7: Not a check.
- e8-d7: Not a check.
- e8-c8: Not a check.

**Pawn moves:**
- f6-g5: Not a check.
- h7-h6: Not a check.
- f6-f5: Not a check.
- e6-e5: Not a check.
- h7-h5: Not a check.

**Other queen moves:**
- Qa2-a7: Not a check.
- Qa2-a6: Not a check.
- Qa2-d5: Not a check.
- Qa2-a5: Not a check.
- Qa2-c4: Not a check.
- Qa2-a4: Not a check.
- Qa2-b3: Not a check.
- Qa2-a3: Not a check.
- Qa2-h2: Not a check.
- Qa2-g2: Not a check.
- Qa2-f2: Not a check.
- Qa2-e2: Not a check.
- Qa2-d2: Not a check.
- Qa2-c2: Not a check.
- Qa2-b2: Not a check.
- Qa2-b1: Not a check.
- Qa2-a1: Not a check.

So, there are no checks available.

**What is White's threat?**
White has no immediate threats. The only possible plan is to push g5-g6 and try to create a passed pawn, but Black can easily stop this.

**How to make progress?**
- Bring the rook to the second rank (Ra2), threatening mate on d2.
- Bring the queen to b1, threatening mate on d1.
- Bring the knight to c3, threatening Nc3+ and then mate.
- Push the f-pawn to f5, f4, and open up the king.

But the most direct plan is to bring the rook to the second rank.

**Ra2** threatens Ra1+ and mate on d1.

But the rook is on a8, so Ra8-a2 is not a legal move.

But **Qa2-a1** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-b1** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-c2** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-b2** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-b3** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-c4** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-d5** is not a legal move.

**Qa2-a7** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-a6** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-a5** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-a4** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-a3** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-h2** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-g2** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-f2** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-e2** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-d2** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-c2** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-b2** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-b1** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

**Qa2-a1** is a legal move, but doesn't threaten anything.

So, the queen can't do much.

**Knight moves:**
- Ne4-d6: Not a check, but brings the knight back to defend.
- Ne4-g5: Not a check, but attacks h3.
- Ne4-c5: Not a check, but attacks b3.
- Ne4-g3: Not a check, but attacks h1.
- Ne4-c3: Not a check, but attacks d1.

**Ne4-c3** attacks the king on d1, but it's not a check.

But if the knight is on c3, then the queen can go to b1 and threaten mate.

So, **Ne4-c3** is a strong move.

Let's see what happens after **Ne4-c3**:

1. ... Nc3+
   - If Kc2, then Qb1+ and Kxc3 is not possible because the queen is protected by the knight.
   - If Kc1, then Qb1# is mate.

So, after **Ne4-c3+**, White is forced to play Kc2, then **Qb1#** is mate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e4c3
```

2025-06-11 22:02:57,198 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.43s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/2n4P/q7/3K4 w kq - 7 49

Key features of the position:
1. Material: White has king + pawns vs Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawns - Black is up significant material
2. King safety: White's king is very exposed on d1
3. Immediate threats: Black's queen on a2 is attacking the h2 pawn and could deliver checks
4. Legal moves: Only king moves available (d1e1 or d1c1)

Looking at the move history, we can see this has been a desperate defensive struggle for White, with Black having multiple ways to win. The position appears to be a theoretical loss for White, but we must find the most resilient defense.

Option 1: d1e1
- Gets the king slightly safer
- But allows ...Qa1+ next move, forcing the king back to d1 or e2
- After ...Qa1+ Ke2, Black can play ...Nc1+ winning more material

Option 2: d1c1
- Moves the king towards the corner
- Still allows ...Qa1+ but now Kb2 is possible
- Black can then play ...Qb1+ Ka3, but this might offer more resistance
- The knight on c3 is a problem though, as it can deliver forks

After deep consideration, d1c1 appears slightly more resilient as it might allow some counterplay against Black's king if we can survive the immediate threats. The position is lost regardless, but this move makes it harder for Black to coordinate their pieces for a quick finish.

2025-06-11 22:03:05,149 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.73s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a2), Rook (a8), Knight (c3), Bishop (b7), Pawns (e6, f6, h7, g8), King (e8)
- White: King (c1), Pawn (g5), Pawn (h3)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is on e8, relatively safe for now.
- White's king is on c1, exposed and vulnerable.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens mate with Ra1+ (if the c1 king moves).
- White has no immediate threats; the only active pawn is g5.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Not possible, as the queen is on a2 and the king is on c1.
2. **Qa1**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.
3. **Ra1+**: Not possible, as the rook is on a8 and the queen is on a2.
4. **Qa3+**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.
5. **Qa4**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.
6. **Ne2+**: Not possible, as the knight is on c3.
7. **Nxa2+**: Not possible, as the knight is on c3.
8. **Qb1+**: Not possible, as the queen is on a2.
9. **Qa1**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.

**Best Move Candidates:**
- **Qa1**: Pins the king to the back rank, but not check.
- **Qa3**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.
- **Qa4**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.
- **Ne2+**: Not possible, as the knight is on c3.
- **Nc3-e2+**: Not possible, as the knight is on c3.
- **Qa1**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.

**Other Moves:**
- **Qa1**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.
- **Qa3**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.
- **Qa4**: Not check, but could threaten mate if the king moves.

**Critical Analysis:**
- The White king is stuck on c1.
- Black's queen on a2 is dominating.
- Black's knight on c3 is controlling key squares (b1, d1, e2, a2).
- Black's rook on a8 is ready to swing into action.
- White's only hope is to push the g-pawn, but it's too slow.

**Immediate Threats:**
- If Black plays Qa1+, White is forced to block with Kc2 or Kd2, but both are not possible as the king is on c1 and can't move to those squares.

**Checkmate Threats:**
- If Black plays Qa1+, it's checkmate as the king cannot move to any square.

**Final Move:**
- **Qa1#** is checkmate.

2025-06-11 22:03:24,400 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.95s):
Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/2n4P/8/q1K5 w kq - 9 50

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and some minor pieces)
2. Black has a queen on a1 that is very active
3. White's king is exposed on c1
4. Black has threats with the queen and knight coordination
5. We only have two legal moves: c1d2 or c1c2

Let's evaluate both options:

1. c1d2:
- Gets the king slightly safer by moving towards the corner
- But puts the king on a light square where black's bishop can potentially attack
- Doesn't immediately address the threat of black's queen

2. c1c2:
- Keeps the king on the back rank
- Potentially allows the king to move to b3 later
- Might be safer from immediate threats
- But still leaves the king somewhat exposed

Looking deeper at potential threats:
- Black's queen on a1 is very dangerous
- Black's knight on c3 is well placed
- Black could play Qa2+ after either move
- After c1c2, Qa2+ would force Kc1 (repetition) or Kd3 which is dangerous
- After c1d2, Qa2+ would force Kd1 or Ke1, both keeping the king in the center

The best practical chance seems to be c1c2, as it keeps the option of moving towards b3 later and avoids immediately putting the king on a light square where the bishop could become active.

After c1c2, if black plays Qa2+, we can consider Kb1, though that would allow Qxb1#. Therefore, we'd have to play Kc1 again, likely leading to a draw by repetition if black insists.

Given that we're in a difficult position and black has strong threats, forcing a draw by repetition might be the most prudent outcome here rather than risking losing with an active black queen.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c1c2
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), rook (a8), bishop (b7), knight (c3), pawns (f6, e6, h7, g8), king (e8)
- White: King (c2), pawn (h3), pawn (g5)

**King safety:**
- Black's king is on e8, but White has no immediate threats.
- White's king is on c2, exposed, and Black's queen and knight are very active.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens mate in one with Qd1# (a1d1).
- White has no checks or threats.

**Candidate moves:**
- a1d1 is checkmate, as the White king on c2 has no escape squares and cannot block or capture the queen.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is the immediate checkmate.

Final move:

Let me analyze this critical position thoroughly.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/2n4P/2K5/3q4 w kq - 11 51

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have queen vs queen)
2. Black has a dangerous passed pawn on a2 that's about to queen
3. White's king is exposed but currently not in immediate danger
4. Black's queen is very active on d1
5. White has a passed g-pawn that could become dangerous

Legal moves: c2c3 or c2b2

Let's evaluate both options:

1. c2c3:
- Protects the b2 square from potential queen checks
- But allows Black to play Qd1xc3+ winning the pawn
- After Kxc3, Black can play Nxe2+ forking king and queen
- This leads to material loss for White

2. c2b2:
- Moves the king away from the c-file
- Prevents immediate queen checks
- But allows Black to play Qd1xb3+ winning the pawn
- However, after Kxb3, Black has no immediate discovered checks
- White can then try to push the g-pawn

After deeper calculation:
- c2b2 seems more resilient as after Qxb3+ Kxb3, Black's knight can't immediately fork
- The g-pawn becomes a real threat that Black must deal with
- Black's a-pawn can be stopped by the white king

The alternative c2c3 leads to immediate material loss and likely defeat.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
c2b2
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, Queen on d1, Rook on a8, Bishop on b7, Knight on c3, Pawns on f6, e6, h7, g8 (rook), h3 (pawn)
- White: King on b2, Pawn on h3, g5

**Immediate threats:**
- White's king is exposed on b2.
- Black's queen is very active on d1, and the knight on c3 is close to the white king.
- Black has a huge material advantage (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. lone king and two pawns).
- White has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
- d1b1+ (Queen check, forces king to a3 or c2)
- d1d2+ (Queen check, king to a3 or b3)
- d1b3+ (Queen check, king to a1 or c1)
- c3a4+ (Knight check, king to a2 or b3)
- a8a2+ (Rook check, king to c3 or b1)
- e8f7 (centralize king, but not urgent)
- f6g5 (capture pawn, but not urgent)
- e6e5 (open lines, but not urgent)

**Checkmate threats:**
- Black can try to force the king to the a-file and deliver mate with queen and rook.

Let's look at the most forcing moves: **checks**.

1. **d1b1+**: King must go to a3 or c2.
   - If Kc2, then Ra2+ is mate.
   - If Ka3, then Ra1# is mate.

2. **d1c2+**: King must go to a1 or a3.
   - If Ka1, then Ra2# is mate.
   - If Ka3, then Ra1# is mate.

3. **d1a1+**: King must go to a1, then Ra2# is mate.

But the king is on b2, so let's check d1b1+:

- 51...Qb1+ 52.Ka3 (only move)
- 52...Ra1# is checkmate.

Therefore, the move is:

```
d1b1
```

2025-06-11 22:04:11,879 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.07s):
Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/2n4P/1K6/1q6 w kq - 13 52

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has king + queen + knight + pawns)
2. White's king is exposed and under severe pressure
3. Black's queen is extremely active and threatening multiple checks
4. White's only legal move is b2c3 (king to c3)
5. Black has multiple threats including queen checks and potential knight forks

Let's examine b2c3 in detail:
- After b2c3, Black can play qb1+ forcing the king to move again
- Then qa2+ would force the king back to b1
- Black can then bring the knight into play with ne2+ winning material

Alternative ideas:
- White has no other legal moves (all other squares are controlled by Black's pieces)
- The g5 pawn is blocked and cannot advance
- The h3 pawn is pinned to the king

Conclusion:
This is a lost position for White. Black has too many active pieces and White's king has no safe squares. The only legal move b2c3 leads to immediate loss of material or checkmate in a few moves.

Since we must make a move, we play the only legal move available:

```
b2c3
```

However, I must note that this leads to a forced loss. Black will win the game with accurate play from this position. The position demonstrates the importance of king safety and the power of a centralized queen in the endgame.

- White: King (c3), Pawn (g5), Pawn (h3)

**White's king is exposed on c3. Black's queen is on b1, ready to check. Black's rook is on a8, ready to join the attack. White has no immediate threats.**

The immediate threat is that Black can play Qxh3 next move, winning a pawn and creating a dangerous passed h-pawn.

Legal moves to consider:
1. c3c4 - moves king away but doesn't address the threat to h3
2. c3b4 - same as above
3. c3d3 - moves king towards center but still leaves h3 hanging
4. c3b3 - moves king towards queenside but doesn't help
5. c3d2 - moves king towards center but still leaves h3 hanging
6. c3c2 - best option as it protects h3 by putting the king on c2 where it defends h3 via Kc2-b1-a2 if needed

After c3c2, if Black takes h3 with Qxh3, we can play Kb1, then Ka2 to chase the queen away and protect our pawns. Meanwhile, our g-pawn is very advanced and could become dangerous.

The other moves either don't address the immediate threat or leave our king in a more vulnerable position. c3c2 is the most resilient move that maintains our defensive structure while keeping counterplay chances with our passed pawns.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), King (e8), Knight (g8), pawns f6, e6, h7
- White: King (c2), Pawn (g5), Pawn (h3)

**Black to move.**

**Threats:**
- White has no immediate threats. The king is on c2, far from Black's pieces.
- Black is up massive material (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. king and two pawns).
- The only thing to watch for is stalemate or perpetual check, but White has no such resources.

**Objectives:**
- Avoid stalemate.
- Avoid allowing White to promote a pawn.
- Press for a swift checkmate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa2+**: Forces the White king to b1 or c1. If Kc1, then Qa1# is mate. If Kb1, then Be4+ is strong.
2. **Qa4**: Not as forcing.
3. **Qa3**: Not as forcing.
4. **Qa5**: Not as forcing.
5. **Qa6**: Not as forcing.
6. **Qa8**: Not as forcing.
7. **Qa7**: Not as forcing.
8. **Qa1**: Already on a1.
9. **Qa2**: This is the most forcing move.

**Let's check Qa2+:**
- 53...Qa2+ 54. Kc1 Qa1# is mate.
- 53...Qa2+ 54. Kb1 Be4+ 55. Kc1 Qc2#

So, **Qa2+** is a direct mate in 2.

**Final Move:**

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/q1K5/8 w kq - 3 54

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and some pawns)
2. Black's queen is very active on a2, eyeing the white king
3. White's king is exposed on c2
4. Black has a passed a-pawn that's advanced to a2
5. White has a passed g-pawn on g5 that could become dangerous
6. Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on f6

Legal moves: c2d3, c2c3, c2d1, c2c1

Let's evaluate each:
1. c2d3 - Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks from black queen
2. c2c3 - Keeps king protected but doesn't make progress
3. c2d1 - Retreats king to first rank, but may be too passive
4. c2c1 - Similar to d1 but keeps king near the g-pawn

Best option seems c2c1 because:
- It removes the king from immediate danger
- Prepares to support the g-pawn's advance
- Keeps options open for king movement towards the g-pawn
- Doesn't allow any immediate checks or threats from black
- The position appears drawn with best play, so we must be careful not to lose

The g-pawn is our best chance for counterplay, so we should position our king to support it while keeping the black queen at bay.

2025-06-11 22:05:16,070 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.64s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a2), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), Pawns (e6, f6, h7)
- White: King (c1), Pawn (h3), Pawn (g5)

**King Safety:**
- Black's king (e8) is relatively safe, with no immediate threats.
- White's king (c1) is exposed and vulnerable to checks from the Black queen.

**Threats:**
- Black is threatening mate and has a huge material advantage.
- White has no immediate threats; the only hope is to push the g-pawn and try to promote, but Black's queen and bishop can easily stop this.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the White king to b2 or c2. If Kc2, then Be4+ is mate.
2. **Qa3+**: Similar idea, but Qa1+ is more forcing.
3. **Qb1+**: Also forces the king to c3 or d2, but Qa1+ is more direct.
4. **Be4**: Threatens mate, but not as forcing as a queen check.
5. **Ra1+**: Not possible, rook is on a8.

**Calculation:**
- After **Qa1+**, if Kc2, then **Be4#** is checkmate.
- If Kd2, then **Qb2+** and mate follows.
- If Kd1, then **Qb1#** is mate.

So, **Qa1+** is the most forcing move and leads to mate in 1 or 2.

Let me analyze the position deeply.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/8/q1K5 w kq - 5 55

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has queen + rook + bishop + pawns)
2. White's king is very exposed and under heavy attack
3. Black's queen is actively placed and threatening multiple checks
4. White has two legal moves: Kd2 or Kc2
5. Black has multiple threats including Qa2+ or Qb1+

Let's examine both moves:

1. Kc2:
- Black can play Qa2+ forcing Kc1 (only move)
- Then Qa1+ Kc2 Qa2+ repeats the position (likely draw by repetition)
- Or Black could try other moves like ...Bc6 threatening mate

2. Kd2:
- Black can play Qb2+ forcing Kd1 (only move)
- Then Qb1+ Kd2 Qb2+ also repeats
- Black might also have Qa2 threatening mate

The critical difference is that after Kc2 Qa2+ Kc1, Black has the option of Bc6 threatening mate in 1 (Qxc1#), which would be winning for Black. After Kd2, this option isn't available.

Therefore, Kd2 is more resilient as it doesn't allow the immediate Bc6 threat. Both moves lead to repetition, but Kd2 gives Black fewer dangerous options.

The safest path is to choose Kd2, forcing the repetition sequence and securing at least a draw.

2025-06-11 22:05:39,246 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.23s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), King (e8), pawns f6, e6, h7
- White: King (d2), Pawn (g5), Pawn (h3)

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen, rook, bishop, and knight for almost nothing. White has only two pawns and a king.
- Black's queen is on a1, threatening to invade.
- White's king is on d2, with no real pawn cover.
- Black's king is on e8, but White has no pieces to attack.
- Black's bishop on b7 covers the long diagonal.
- Black's rook on a8 is ready to join the attack.
- Black's knight on g8 is not developed, but can be brought in.
- Black's f6 pawn controls e5 and g5.
- White's only hope is to try to queen the g-pawn, but Black can easily stop it.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can check with the queen (Qa2+), forcing the king to c3 or e3.
- Black can bring the rook to a2 or a3 to cut off the king.
- Black can play Ra2, threatening mate with Qb2#.
- Black can play Qb2+, forcing the king to e1 or d1, then Ra1+.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qa2+ — Immediate check, king must move.
2. Ra2 — Threatens mate on b2.
3. Qb2+ — Immediate check, king must move.
4. Ra1 — Threatens mate on b2.
5. e5 — Not urgent, but opens lines.
6. h6 — Not urgent.
7. f5 — Not urgent.

Let's look at the checks:
- Qa2+ Kc3 (only move), then Ra3+ Kb4, Qb2# is mate.
- Qa2+ Ke3, then Qa3+ Kf2, Qf3+ is mate in a few.

**Calculation:**
1. Qa2+ Kc3 (only move)
   - Ra3+ Kb4 (only move)
   - Qb2# (mate)

So, Qa2+ is a forced mate in 3.

**Final move:**

2025-06-11 22:05:59,669 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.13s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/q2K4/8 w kq - 7 56

Key features of the position:
1. White is in check from the black queen on a2
2. White king is on d2
3. Black has a strong passed pawn on a2 that could promote soon
4. White has a passed pawn on g5
5. Black's king is still in the center (e8)
6. Material is roughly equal (White has K+2 pawns vs Black's K+Q+2 pawns, but White has compensation)

Legal moves are all king moves to escape check: d2e3, d2d3, d2c3, d2e1, d2d1, d2c1

Let's evaluate each option:

1. d2e3:
- Moves towards center but exposes king to potential checks
- After Qa2xe6, White's position collapses

2. d2d3:
- Keeps king relatively safe
- But allows Qa2b2+ next move with strong pressure

3. d2c3:
- Blocks the a2-g8 diagonal
- But allows Qa2xa4 next, winning a pawn
- Also allows Qa2xc4+ next if we're not careful

4. d2e1:
- Retreats king but leaves it very passive
- Allows Black to push pawns or bring queen to attack

5. d2d1:
- Similar to e1 but slightly better
- Still very passive

6. d2c1:
- Gets the king off dangerous diagonals
- Prepares to potentially run to b1 if needed
- Limits Black's immediate threats

After careful consideration, d2c1 seems the most resilient:
- It removes the king from dangerous diagonals
- Prepares potential king run to b1 if needed
- Doesn't immediately lose material
- Maintains some coordination between king and pawns

The other moves either expose the king too much or allow immediate material loss. While the position remains difficult, d2c1 gives White the best chance to hold.

2025-06-11 22:06:07,722 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.80s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/q7/2K5 b kq - 8 56

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: Rook (a8), Queen (a2), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), pawns f6, e6, h7
- White: King (c1), pawn g5, h3

**White's king is on c1, very exposed. Black has a queen on a2, bishop on b7, rook on a8, knight on g8, and pawns. White has only two pawns and a king.**

**Immediate tactical ideas:**
- Black's queen on a2 is cutting off the c2 square.
- The rook on a8 can swing to a1 or a3, but White's king is on c1.
- White has no immediate threats.
- Black can try to deliver mate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the king to c2 or d2 (but c2 is covered by the queen).
2. **Qa3+**: Forces the king to b1 or d2.
3. **Rc8+**: King must go to d2 or b2.
4. **Ra1+**: King must go to b2 or d2.
5. **Qb2+**: King must go to d1 (since c2 is covered).
6. **Qd5**: Not a check, but centralizes the queen.

Let's check **Qa1+**:
- 1...Qa1+ 2.Kc2 (only move)
- Now, 2...Be4+ is possible.
- 3.Kd2 (only move)
- Now, 3...Ra2+ 4.Ke3 Qe1+ 5.Kd4 Qb4+ 6.Ke3 Qd2+ and so on.

Alternatively, **Qa1+** 2.Kc2 Be4+ 3.Kd2 Qb2+ 4.Ke3 Qc3+ 5.Kf4 Qf3#

But let's check if there is a forced mate.

**Line 1:**
1...Qa1+ 2.Kc2 Be4+ 3.Kd2 Qb2+ 4.Ke3 Qc3+ 5.Kf4 Qf3#

Yes, this is forced mate in 5.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
qa1+

2025-06-11 22:06:27,870 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.79s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/8/q1K5 w kq - 9 57

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and some pawns)
2. White's king is very exposed on c1
3. Black's queen is extremely active and harassing White's king
4. Black has a passed a-pawn that's close to promotion
5. White has a passed g-pawn that's further from promotion
6. Black's king is somewhat safer on e8

The position is extremely dangerous for White. Black's queen is dominating the board and White's king has no safe squares. The immediate threat is ...Qa1+ followed by ...Qa2+ with perpetual check or worse.

Legal moves:
1. c1d2 - moves the king towards the center
2. c1c2 - keeps the king on the c-file

Let's analyze both:

1. c1d2:
   - Black can play Qa1+ forcing Kd3 (only move)
   - Then Qa3+ forces Ke2 (only move)
   - Then Qb2+ wins the h-pawn with a decisive advantage

2. c1c2:
   - Black can play Qa2+ forcing Kc1 (only move)
   - Then Qa1+ is a repetition
   - This leads to a draw by repetition

Given that c1d2 leads to a lost position while c1c2 leads to a draw by repetition, the only way to avoid immediate loss is to accept the repetition.

```

2025-06-11 22:06:28,173 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:06:36,676 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.50s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/2K5/q7 b kq - 10 57

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Rook (a8), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), 3 pawns (e6, f6, h7), King (e8)
- White: King (c2), Pawn (g5, h3)

**Black is up a huge amount of material (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. king and two pawns). White has no counterplay and is completely lost. The only thing to watch out for is stalemate or accidental perpetual.**

**Immediate threats:**
- White has no checks, no threats.
- Black can try to force mate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa2+**: Check, forces the king to b1 or c3.
2. **Be4+**: Bishop check, but king can go to c1 or b3.
3. **Ra2+**: Rook check, but not possible (rook on a8).
4. **Qa4+**: Queen check, king to b2 or c1.
5. **Qe4+**: Queen check, king to c1 or b3.
6. **Qb1+**: Queen check, king to d2 or c3.
7. **Qh1**: No threat.
8. **Qe5**: No immediate threat.
9. **Qe1**: No immediate threat.

**Let's check Qa2+:**
- 1...Qa2+ 2. Kc3 (only move)
- Now, 2...Qa1+ 3. Kb4 (only move)
- 3...Qa4+ 4. Kc5 (only move)
- 4...Rc8+ 5. Kd6 (only move)
- 5...Qc6#

But after 1...Qa2+ 2. Kc3, Black can also play Rc8+ and force mate quickly.

Alternatively, **Qa4+**:
- 1...Qa4+ 2. Kd3 (only move)
- 2...Qe4+ 3. Kc3 (only move)
- 3...Rc8+ 4. Kb3 (only move)
- 4...Bd5+ 5. Kb2 (only move)
- 5...Qc2+ 6. Ka1 (only move)
- 6...Qa2#

But let's check for the fastest mate.

**Qa2+** is forcing and keeps the king boxed in.

**Qa2+** is the best move, as it forces the king to c3, and then Black can bring the rook to c8 and deliver mate soon.

**Final move:**
```
a1a2

2025-06-11 22:06:54,992 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.02s):
Let me analyze this position deeply. 

The current FEN: r3k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/q1K5/8 w kq - 11 58

Key features:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and some pawns)
2. White's king is exposed on c2
3. Black's queen is very active on a2, eyeing the h1 square
4. Black has a passed a-pawn that's about to queen
5. White has a passed g-pawn that's advanced to g5
6. Black's king is still in the center but relatively safe

Looking at the legal moves:
1. c2d3 - moves king towards center but exposes it more
2. c2c3 - keeps king near the edge but blocks the c-file
3. c2d1 - moves king towards corner but away from action
4. c2c1 - similar to d1 but keeps king on c-file

The most critical factor is that Black's a-pawn is about to promote (after a2a1=Q). White must either:
- Stop the pawn from promoting, or
- Create counterplay with the g-pawn

After careful consideration:
- c2d3 allows Qb1+ winning the g-pawn
- c2c3 blocks the c-file but doesn't stop promotion
- c2d1 is too passive
- c2c1 is the best as it prepares to meet a2a1=Q with Qxa1, and if Black plays Qb1+ we can respond Kd2

The g-pawn is our main counterplay. After c2c1, if a2a1=Q Qxa1, we can push g6 with serious threats. Black cannot easily stop both the g-pawn and maintain their own threats.

- White's king is on c1, very exposed, and Black's queen is on a2, ready to deliver checks.

**Threats:**
- Black threatens Qa1+ and Qa3+.
- White has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qa1+ — Forces the White king to b2 or d2.
2. Qa3+ — Forces the White king to b1 or d2.
3. Rc8+ — Not possible, rook is on a8.
4. Qc4+ — Not possible, queen is on a2.
5. Qb2+ — Not possible, queen is on a2.

Let's check Qa1+:
- 1...Qa1+ 2. Kc2 (only move)
- 2...Qa2+ 3. Kc1 (only move)
- 3...Qb2+ 4. Kd1 (only move)
- 4...Bf3+ 5. Ke1 Qe2#

But White's king is on c1, so after Qa1+:
- 1...Qa1+ 2. Kc2 Qa2+ 3. Kc1 Qb2+ 4. Kd1 Bf3+ 5. Ke1 Qe2#

Alternatively, after Qa1+ 2. Kc2, Black can continue checking and White's king is in a mating net.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- Qa1+ is the most forcing move, and White's king is forced to b2 or c2, but b2 is covered by the queen.

**Check for stalemate traps:**
- White has pawns on g5 and h3, so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is the most forcing check:

2025-06-11 22:07:01,146 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:07:21,346 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.20s):
Let me analyze this critical position deeply.

Current situation:
- Material: White has only a king (c1) and pawns (g5, h3). Black has a king (somewhere), queen (a2), and pawn (f6).
- The black queen is extremely active and harassing the white king.
- White's pawns are advanced but not yet promoting threats.
- White's king is in a very precarious position, being chased by the black queen.

Key observations:
1. The black queen can deliver perpetual check if we're not careful.
2. Our pawns are our only hope - the g5 pawn is advanced but blocked by f6.
3. We must find a way to either promote a pawn or stop the perpetual checks.

Legal moves:
- c1d2: Moves king towards center
- c1c2: Moves king towards queenside

Analyzing c1d2:
- After c1d2, black can play a2b2+, then d2d1, b2b1+, d1d2, b1a2+ etc. - perpetual check seems unavoidable.

Analyzing c1c2:
- After c1c2, black can play a2a3 (threatening mate)
- Then c2b1 (forced)
- a3b3+ (check)
- b1a1 (only move)
- b3a3+ (perpetual continues)

Alternative idea:
We need to find a way to block the queen's access. The only way might be to advance the h-pawn to create some luft, but it's too slow.

After deep consideration, c1c2 seems slightly better because:
1. It keeps the king closer to the g5 pawn which might become relevant
2. It maintains the option of pushing the h-pawn later
3. It's slightly harder for black to deliver immediate mate

While the position appears lost due to the perpetual check threat, c1c2 gives us the most practical chances to maybe find some resource later.

2025-06-11 22:07:21,628 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:07:40,834 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 19.21s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), rook (a8), bishop (b7), knight (g8), pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8), king (e8)
- White: King (c2), pawn (g5, h3)

**Key points:**
- Black is up a queen, bishop, and rook for a king and two pawns. White has no real counterplay.
- White's king is on c2, exposed, with no shelter and no pieces to defend.
- Black's queen on a1 is extremely powerful, and Black has a bishop on b7 controlling the long diagonal.
- Black's king is safe on e8.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can check on a2 or a4, but White's king can run to d3 or c1.
- Black can try to bring the queen to a4, a2, or b2 to force the king to the edge.
- Black can also consider bringing the rook into play (e.g., Ra2, Ra4, etc.).
- Black can also consider bringing the knight into play (e.g., Ne7, Nh6), but that is slower.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qa2+ — forces the king to d3 or c1.
2. Qa4+ — forces the king to b2 or c1.
3. Ra2+ — forces the king to d3 or b1.
4. Rc8 — brings the rook to the open file.
5. f5 — not urgent, but could restrict the king.
6. h6 — not urgent.

Let's check the most forcing moves:

**1. Qa2+**
- If Kd3, then Qc4+ wins the h3 pawn and keeps the king exposed.
- If Kc1, then Be4 threatens mate on c2.

**2. Qa4+**
- If Kb2, then Qb4+ wins the h3 pawn.
- If Kc1, then Be4.

**3. Ra2+**
- If Kd3, then Qc4+.
- If Kb1, then Qb2# is mate.

Wait, let's check Ra2+:

- Ra2+ Kb1 Qb2# is checkmate.

So, **Ra2+** is a forced mate in one if White plays Kb1.

If White plays Kd3, then Qc4+ wins the h3 pawn and keeps the king exposed.

Therefore, **Ra2+** is the most forcing move, as it threatens immediate mate and keeps the king exposed.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 22:07:56,456 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.33s):
Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/r1K5/q7 w k - 15 60

Key observations:
1. Material is roughly equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has queen + rook + bishop + pawns)
2. White's king is exposed and under heavy attack
3. Black has multiple threats including Qa1-a2+ and Ra2xc2#
4. White has only two legal moves: Kd3 or Kb3

Let's examine both options:

1. c2d3 (Kd3):
- Black can play Qa1-b1+ forcing Kd3-c3
- Then Ra2-a3+ wins the white king (Kc3-b4 Qb1-b4# or Kc3-d4 Qb1-d3#)
- Alternatively after Kd3, Black can play Qa1-a4+ with similar mating threats

2. c2b3 (Kb3):
- Black can play Qa1-b1+ forcing Kb3-a3
- Then Ra2-a2+ wins (Ka3-b4 Qb1-b4#)
- Or after Kb3, Qa1-a4 threatens mate in 1 with Qa4-a3#

Both moves lead to forced mate in a few moves. However, Kb3 might delay mate slightly longer by keeping the king closer to the corner where Black needs to be more precise.

After deep consideration, while both moves lose, c2b3 makes Black work slightly harder for the mate. In practical play, this might give Black more chances to go wrong, though the position is objectively lost.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/1K5P/r7/q7 b k - 16 60

**Material:**
- Black: King e8, Rook a2, Queen a1, Bishop b7, Knight g8, Pawns f6, e6, h7
- White: King b3, Pawn g5, h3

**Key points:**
- Black is up a queen, rook, bishop, and several pawns for almost nothing.
- White's king is on b3, exposed, with only two pawns left (g5, h3).
- Black's queen and rook are extremely active and can coordinate for mate.
- White has no real counterplay.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can deliver mate in a few moves with proper coordination.
- The White king is boxed in on b3, with only a few escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa3+**: Forces the White king to a2 or c2.
2. **Bd5+**: Not possible, bishop is on b7.
3. **Ra3+**: Not possible, rook is on a2.
4. **Qa4+**: Not possible, queen is on a1.
5. **Qa8**: Not a check, but could threaten mate.
6. **Ra1**: Not a check, but could threaten mate.
7. **Ra3+**: Not possible.
8. **Qa3+**: This is the most forcing.

**Let's check Qa3+:**
- 1... Qa3+ 2. Kc4 (only move) Ra4# is mate.
- 1... Qa3+ 2. Kc2 (only other move) Be4+ 3. Kd1 Qd3+ 4. Ke1 Qe2#

But after 1... Qa3+, White's only legal move is Kc4, then Ra4# is checkmate.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
qa3+
```

2025-06-11 22:08:22,297 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.21s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/rK5P/8/q7 w k - 17 61

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns, Black has king + queen + rook + bishop + pawns)
2. White's king is exposed and under heavy attack
3. Black has multiple threats including Qa1-a2+ and Ra3xb3+
4. White's pawns are advanced but not immediately threatening
5. Black's pieces are very active while White's are passive

Looking at the legal moves:
1. b3c4 - moves king away but allows Qa1-a2+ next
2. b3b4 - same issue with Qa1-a2+
3. b3c2 - this seems most resilient as it blocks the queen's path to a2

After b3c2:
- Black can play Ra3-a2 pinning the king to the queen
- Or Qa1-b1+ forcing the king back
- Or Qa1-a4+ with continuing pressure

This is a very difficult position for White. The best chance is to try to prolong the game and hope for a mistake. b3c2 offers the most resistance as it prevents immediate mate threats and keeps some coordination between king and pawns.

After careful consideration, the best practical chance is:
```
b3c2
```

2025-06-11 22:08:27,554 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.02s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Queen (a1), Rook (a3), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), Pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8)
- White: King (c2), Pawn (g5), Pawn (h3)

**Black is up a queen, rook, bishop, and two pawns for a king and two pawns. White has no pieces except the king and two pawns.**

**Threats:**
- White's only hope is to promote the g5 pawn, but Black's material is overwhelming.
- Black can checkmate quickly with coordinated heavy pieces.

**Candidate moves:**
- a3a2+ (Rook to a2, check): White king must move, then Qa1b2# is mate.
- Qa1a2+ (Queen to a2, check): White king must move, but not as forcing as above.
- Qa1b2+ (Queen to b2, check): White king must move, but not as forcing as above.
- a3a1 (Rook to a1): Not as forcing.
- f6g5 (Pawn takes pawn): Removes White's only hope of counterplay, but slower than mate.

**Calculation:**
1. a3a2+ Kc1 (only move)
2. Qa1b2# (Checkmate)

**Conclusion:**  
The fastest and most accurate way to checkmate is:

```
a3a2

Let me analyze this critical position thoroughly.

The FEN shows:
- White king at c2
- Black has queen at a2, rook at a3, and pawns that don't seem immediately dangerous
- White has pawns at g5, h3 and a passed h-pawn
- Material is roughly equal (queen vs queen+rook, but white's king is exposed)

Key observations:
1. Black's queen and rook are coordinating well against white's exposed king
2. White's king has only two legal moves: c2d3 or c2b3
3. Black is threatening immediate mate threats if white doesn't respond precisely
4. The h-pawn is passed but not immediately relevant

Let's evaluate the two candidate moves:

1. c2d3:
- Gets the king away from the a-file where black's rook and queen can coordinate
- But brings the king closer to black's potential mating threats
- After ...Qb1+, white would have to go Kc3 allowing ...Ra2 with threats

2. c2b3:
- Moves the king towards the queenside where there's more space
- Potentially safer from immediate mating threats
- After ...Qb1+, white can respond Ka3
- The king is further from black's pieces' coordination

After deep consideration, c2b3 appears safer because:
- It keeps the king further from black's coordinated pieces
- Provides more escape routes in case of checks
- Doesn't immediately walk into potential discovered attacks
- Maintains more flexibility to defend against mating threats

The move c2d3 seems more dangerous as it brings the king closer to black's pieces where they can coordinate better.

Therefore, the best move in this critical position is:

```
c2b3
```

2025-06-11 22:08:53,022 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.92s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Knight (g8), Bishop (b7), Pawn (f6, e6, h7), Rook (a2), Queen (a1)
- White: King (b3), Pawn (g5, h3)

**White's king is very exposed on b3.**
- Black has a massive material advantage: up a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and several pawns.
- White has only two pawns and a king.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can deliver checks with the queen, rook, or bishop.
- White has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1-e5+**: Queen check, king must move.
2. **Qa1-b2+**: Queen check, king must move.
3. **Ra2-a3+**: Rook check, king must move.
4. **Qa1-a3+**: Queen check, king must move.
5. **Bishop moves**: Not immediately threatening.
6. **Knight moves**: Not immediately threatening.

Let's look at the most forcing moves: checks.

**1. Qa1-e5+**
- White's only legal move is Ka2 (since Kc2 is covered by the bishop, Kb4 is covered by the queen, Kc4 is covered by the queen, Kb2 is covered by the queen).
- After Ka2, Black can play Qb2# (checkmate).

**2. Qa1-b2+**
- White's only move is Kc4 (Ka4 is covered by the queen, Kc2 is covered by the bishop, Kb4 is covered by the queen).
- After Kc4, Black can play Qb4# (checkmate).

**3. Ra2-a3+**
- White's only move is Kb4.
- After Kb4, Black can play Qa4# (checkmate).

**4. Qa1-a3+**
- White's only move is Kc4.
- After Kc4, Black can play Qb4# (checkmate).

**All these moves lead to forced mate in one or two moves.**

Let's check which move is the fastest and most forcing.

- **Qa1-b2+** Kc4 Qb4# (mate)
- **Qa1-e5+** Ka2 Qb2# (mate)
- **Ra2-a3+** Kb4 Qa4# (mate)
- **Qa1-a3+** Kc4 Qb4# (mate)

All are mate in two, but **Qa1-b2+** and **Qa1-a3+** force the king to c4, then Qb4# is mate.

**Qa1-b2+** is a direct queen check, and after Kc4, Qb4# is mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
a1b2
```

2025-06-11 22:09:10,447 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.19s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/1K5P/rq6/8 w k - 21 63

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has king + bishop + pawns)
2. White's king is somewhat exposed on b3
3. Black has a passed a-pawn that's about to promote (a2)
4. Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal
5. White has two passed pawns (g5 and h3) but they're far from promotion
6. Black's rook is on a2, controlling the a-file

The only legal move is b3c4 (king moves to c4). Let's evaluate this:

Pros of Kc4:
- Gets the king closer to the center
- Potentially can support the g-pawn's advance
- Moves away from the bishop's diagonal

Cons of Kc4:
- Allows Black to promote with a1=Q
- King might be too far from the queenside to stop the a-pawn

Alternative ideas:
There are no alternatives - b3c4 is the only legal move.

After b3c4, Black will play a1=Q. Then:
- If White tries to push g6, Black has Qxg5 (removing a passed pawn)
- The h-pawn is blockaded by Black's bishop
- Black can bring the king to support the bishop

This looks like a lost position for White because:
1. Black can promote the a-pawn
2. White's passed pawns are too slow
3. White has no way to create counterplay

However, since this is the only legal move, we must play it and hope for some miracle. Maybe Black will blunder in time trouble.

2025-06-11 22:09:16,749 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.04s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a2), queen (b2), bishop (b7), knight (g8), pawns (f6, e6, h7)
- White: King (c4), pawns (g5, h3)

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen, rook, bishop, and two pawns for just two pawns. White has no pieces except the king and two pawns.
- White's king is on c4, somewhat exposed.
- Black's pieces are extremely active and dominate the board.
- There are no immediate threats from White. The only concern is to avoid stalemate or perpetual check.

**Immediate tactical ideas:**
- Black can check the White king with Qb4+ or Rc2+.
- Black can also try to force the White king to the edge and deliver mate.
- Black must avoid stalemating the White king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qb4+**: Forces the White king to move. If Kd3, then Qc3# is mate. If Kd4, then Qc4# is mate. If Kd5, then Qc5# is mate. If Kd3, then Qc3# is mate. If Kd5, then Qc5# is mate. If Kd4, then Qc4# is mate.
2. **Rc2+**: Also checks, but Qb4+ is more forcing.
3. **Other moves**: Not as forcing as Qb4+.

**Calculation:**
- After **Qb4+**:
    - If Kd3, then Qc3#.
    - If Kd5, then Qc5#.
    - If Kd4, then Qc4#.

All moves lead to immediate mate.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```

2025-06-11 22:09:29,407 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 11.80s):
Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current position analysis:
- Material: White has king + pawn vs Black has king + queen + rook + bishop. Black is up massively in material.
- King safety: White king is exposed on b2, Black king is relatively safe on e8.
- Pawn structure: White has a passed g-pawn on g5, but it's blockaded by Black's f6 pawn.
- Immediate threats: Black's queen and rook are very active, while White has no active pieces.

Legal moves:
1. c4b4 - Moving the king towards the center
2. c4d3 - Moving the king towards the queenside

Evaluation:
- c4b4 would walk into potential discovered checks from Black's bishop on b7
- c4d3 seems safer, moving away from immediate threats
- The position appears completely lost for White due to massive material disadvantage
- The only hope is to try to promote the g-pawn, but Black can easily stop it

Best practical chance:
- c4d3 at least keeps the king slightly safer and doesn't immediately walk into checks
- There's no realistic way to save the game, but this move prolongs resistance

After c4d3, Black can continue with checks like Qb2+ or Rb2+, but there's no way to avoid losing material or getting mated soon.

2025-06-11 22:09:35,144 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.34s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a2, queen on b4, bishop on b7, knight on g8, pawns on f6, e6, h7, h8
- White: King on d3, pawn on g5, h3

**White's king is exposed on d3. Black has a huge material advantage (queen, rook, bishop, and pawns vs. just two pawns for White).**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can check the White king with Qb3+ or Qe4+.
- The White king is on d3, so Qb3+ would force the king to c4 or d4.
- White has no immediate threats; Black is completely winning.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qb3+ (forces the king to c4 or d4)
2. Qe4+ (forces the king to c3 or d2)
3. Ba6+ (forces the king to c3 or d4)
4. Ra3+ (forces the king to c4 or d4)
5. Qc4+ (forces the king to d2 or e3)

Let's check the lines:

**1. Qb3+**
- If Kd4, then Ra4+ is mate.
- If Kc4, then Ba6# is mate.

So, Qb3+ is a forced mate in 1 or 2.

Let's check:
- 64... Qb3+ 65. Kd4 Ra4# (mate)
- 64... Qb3+ 65. Kc4 Ba6# (mate)

Therefore, Qb3+ is the best move, leading to forced mate next move.

**Final move:**
```
b4b3

Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/1q1K3P/r7/8 w k - 25 65

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has king + queen + rook + bishop + pawns)
2. White's king is exposed and under heavy attack
3. Black has multiple threats including Qb3+ followed by Ra1 mate
4. White's only legal move is Kd4

Let's examine Kd4:
- After Kd4, Black can play Qb3+ forcing Kc5 (only move)
- Then Black has Ra1 with mate threats
- White has no way to defend against the mating threats

This appears to be a forced mate in a few moves regardless of White's response. The position is completely lost for White as Black's pieces coordinate perfectly to deliver mate while White has no counterplay or defensive resources.

Since the position is objectively lost and there are no saving resources, I must resign. In chess, when a position is clearly lost with no possible saving moves, resignation is the proper course of action.

```
resign

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/3K4/1q5P/r7/8 b k - 26 65

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a2), queen (b3), bishop (b7), knight (g8), pawns (f6, e6, h7)
- White: King (d4), pawn (g5), pawn (h3)

**White's king is exposed on d4. Black has a huge material advantage (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. just pawns and king).**

**Immediate threats:**
- White has no immediate threats.
- Black can look for forced mates or ways to win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qb6+**: Checks the king. White's only legal move is Kc4. Then, after Qb3+, Kd4, and repeat. This is a check repetition, but let's see if there's more.
2. **Ra4+**: Checks the king. White can only go to c5 or d3. Let's see:
   - 1...Ra4+ 2.Kc5 (if 2.Kd3, then Qc4# is mate)
   - After 2.Kc5, Qb4# is mate.
   - After 2.Kd3, Qc4# is mate.

**Let's check this line:**
- 1...Ra4+ 2.Kd3 Qc4# (mate)
- 1...Ra4+ 2.Kc5 Qb4# (mate)

**Therefore, Ra4+ is a forced mate in 2.**

**Conclusion:** The best move is:
```
a2a4

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/r2K4/1q5P/8/8 w k - 27 66

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, pawns)
2. Black's king is exposed on e8
3. White's king is on d4, which is somewhat exposed but active
4. Black has a passed a-pawn that's far advanced (a2)
5. White has a passed g-pawn on g5
6. Black's queen is very active on b3
7. White's only legal move is d4c5 (king to c5)

Looking at d4c5:
- Moves the king towards the a-pawn which is dangerous
- But it also brings the king closer to support the g-pawn
- After Kc5, Black has several options:
  - Qc3+ would force Kb5 or Kd5
  - Qa3+ would force Kb5
  - a1=Q would be very dangerous
  - Or they could play Bc8 attacking our queen

The most critical line seems to be:
1. Kc5 Qa3+
Now:
- If 2. Kb5, then 2...a1=Q and Black has a decisive attack
- If 2. Kd5, then 2...Qd3+ 3. Ke5 Qe3+ 4. Kf5 Qf3+ winning the g-pawn

Alternatively:
1. Kc5 Qc3+
2. Kb5 a1=Q
And Black's two queens should win

Given that Kc5 seems to lose immediately, we must conclude that the position is lost for White. Black's a-pawn is too far advanced and White's king cannot both stop it and support the g-pawn. 

Since d4c5 is the only legal move and it leads to a lost position, we must play it anyway. There are no alternatives.

2025-06-11 22:10:15,743 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:10:22,012 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.27s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a4, queen on b3, bishop on b7, knight on g8, pawns on f6, e6, h7, h8
- White: King on c5, pawn on g5, pawn on h3

**Black's advantages:**
- Massive material advantage: queen, rook, bishop, and pawns vs. just two pawns for White.
- White's king is exposed on c5.
- Black has multiple ways to check and restrict the White king.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can check with the queen (b3-c4+), rook (a4-a5+), or coordinate for mate.
- White has no immediate threats; only pawns on g5 and h3.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qb3-c4+**: Forces the White king to move. Let's see the king's options:
   - Kd6: Then Qd5# is mate.
   - Kb6: Then Qb4+ wins the pawn on b3, but not mate.
   - Kd6 is forced, and then Qd5# is mate.

2. **Ra4-a5+**: White king can go to b6, b4, or d6.
   - Kb6: Qb3-a5# is mate.
   - Kd6: Qb3-d5# is mate.
   - Kb4: Qb3-b4# is mate.

So, **Ra4-a5+** is a forced mate in one, regardless of where the king goes.

**Double-check:**
- Ra4-a5+ Kb6 Qb3-a5# (but after Ra4-a5+, Kb6 is not possible because a5 is covered by the rook).
- Ra4-a5+ Kd6 Qb3-d5# is mate.
- Ra4-a5+ Kb4 Qb3-b4# is mate.

But actually, after Ra4-a5+, Kb6 is not possible because a5 is covered by the rook, so only Kd6 and Kb4 are possible.

- Kd6: Qd5#.
- Kb4: Qb4#.

So, **Ra4-a5+** is a forced mate in one.

**Final move:**
```
a4a5

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/r1K3P1/8/1q5P/8/8 w k - 29 67

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + pawn + bishop)
2. White's king is on c5, Black's king on e8
3. White has a passed pawn on g5, Black has pawns on f6 and h7
4. Black has a bishop on b7 and a rook on a5
5. Black's queen is on b3, threatening White's pawn on h3

Legal moves: c5d6 or c5d4

Let's evaluate both options:

1. c5d6:
- Moves king towards the center
- Protects the e6 pawn which could become important
- But allows Black's queen to check with Qd3+
- After Qd3+, White would have to move to c5 or c6, both not ideal

2. c5d4:
- Moves king forward aggressively
- Covers the d3 square preventing Qd3+
- Threatens to advance to d5 then e6, supporting the g pawn
- Creates potential for king to assist the g pawn's promotion
- Black's immediate threats are limited after this move

The main strategic plan should be:
- Advance the g pawn while protecting our h3 pawn
- Use the king actively to support the pawn promotion
- Try to limit Black's counterplay with their bishop and rook

c5d4 is the stronger move because:
- It's more active
- Prevents immediate checks
- Prepares to support the g pawn's advance
- Limits Black's options more than c5d6

After c5d4, Black's best try would be something like Qb3-d5+, but then Kd4 keeps the initiative.

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-11 22:10:46,756 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.24s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a5, queen on b3, bishop on b7, knight on g8, pawns on e6, f6, h7, h8
- White: King on d4, pawn on g5, h3

**Black's advantages:**
- Up a queen, rook, bishop, and two pawns for a king and two pawns.
- White's king is exposed on d4.
- Black has a passed e-pawn and f-pawn.
- White has no immediate threats.

**Immediate tactical opportunities:**
- Black can check with Qb6+ or Qd5+.
- Black can try to force mate or win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qb6+**: Forces the White king to move, as c5 and e5 are covered by Black's pawns, and c3 is covered by the rook on a5. After Kc4, Black can play Ba6# (mate).
2. **Qd5+**: Also checks, but White can play Ke3 or Kc3.
3. **Ba6**: Threatens mate but does not check.
4. **Ra4+**: Not possible as the rook is on a5.

**Calculation:**
- Qb6+ Kc4 Ba6# is checkmate.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
Qb6+
```

2025-06-11 22:11:09,380 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 19.18s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/1q2pp2/r5P1/3K4/7P/8/8 w k - 31 68

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has king + pawns)
2. Black has a passed a-pawn that's very advanced (a2)
3. White's king is somewhat exposed but active
4. Black's king is still on e8
5. White has a g-pawn that's advanced to g5
6. Black has a rook on a5 and bishop on b7

Legal moves: d4c4, d4d3, d4c3

Let's evaluate each option:

1. d4c4:
- Moves king towards the queenside
- Could help stop the a-pawn
- But leaves g5 pawn undefended
- Black could play ...Bxg5 winning a pawn

2. d4d3:
- Moves king forward
- Keeps protection of g5 pawn
- But doesn't make progress against the a-pawn
- Black could push ...a1=Q with check

3. d4c3:
- Moves king towards the a-pawn
- Protects the b4 square from queen checks
- Prepares to blockade the a-pawn
- Maintains some flexibility

The most pressing issue is Black's passed a-pawn. d4c3 seems best as it:
- Directly addresses the a-pawn threat
- Maintains king activity
- Doesn't lose material immediately
- Prepares potential king march to b2 to stop the pawn

Black's main threat is promoting the a-pawn, so we must prioritize stopping it. The other moves either don't address this or create new weaknesses.

After d4c3, if Black plays ...a1=Q, we have c3b2 blocking. If Black tries ...Bxg5, we have h3h4 keeping the pawn structure.

2025-06-11 22:11:09,699 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:11:15,495 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.80s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a5), knight (g8), bishop (b7), queen (b6), pawns (e6, f6, h7, h8)
- White: King (c3), pawn (g5, h3)

**White's king is exposed on c3, Black has a huge material advantage (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. king and two pawns). White's only hope is to try to promote the g-pawn, but Black's pieces are well placed to stop it.**

**Immediate threats:**
- White's g-pawn is two steps from queening, but Black's f6 pawn and bishop on b7 control the queening square.
- Black can try to force mate or win the g-pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a5a3+**: Check, forcing the king to move. If Kc4, then Ba6# is mate.
2. **b6c5+**: Queen check, but king can go to d3 or d2.
3. **b7d5**: Bishop centralizes, but not forcing.
4. **f6g5**: Take the pawn, but not urgent since White can't promote yet.
5. **h7h6**: Slow, not relevant.

**Let's check a5a3+:**
- 1...Ra3+ 2.Kc4 (if Kd4, then Qd4#)
- After 2.Kc4, Ba6# is checkmate.

**Let's check b6c5+:**
- 1...Qc5+ 2.Kd3 (or d2), no immediate mate.

**Therefore, the move a5a3+ is crushing and leads to forced mate:**
- 1...Ra3+ 2.Kc4 Ba6#

**So, the best move is:**
```
a5a3+

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/1q2pp2/6P1/8/r1K4P/8/8 w k - 33 69

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has king + rook + bishop + pawns)
2. White's king is exposed and under attack from Black's rook on a3
3. Black has a passed pawn on a2 that could promote soon
4. White has a passed pawn on g5 that could be dangerous
5. Black's pieces are more active (rook on a3, bishop on b7, king safer)

Legal moves:
1. c3c4 - moves king towards center but away from defending h3 pawn
2. c3d2 - moves king towards Black's rook but away from passed g pawn
3. c3c2 - keeps king near both passed pawns (g and h)

Let's evaluate each:

1. c3c4:
- Gets king slightly safer but abandons defense of h3 pawn
- After ...Ra3xa4, White's position collapses as Black's a-pawn will queen

2. c3d2:
- Moves towards Black's rook which seems counterintuitive
- Black can play ...Ra3a1 threatening mate or ...Bxg2 winning h3 pawn
- Doesn't stop a-pawn from queening

3. c3c2:
- Keeps king near both passed pawns
- Protects h3 pawn indirectly (if ...Bxg2, Kxh3)
- Still keeps an eye on g-pawn's promotion path
- Makes it harder for Black to push the a-pawn immediately

After c3c2, Black's best try is probably ...Ra3a1, but then White can push g6 with counterplay. The king is better placed to support both pawns from c2.

The other moves either abandon key pawns or allow Black's a-pawn to promote too quickly. c3c2 maintains the most defensive resources while keeping some counterplay with the g-pawn.

2025-06-11 22:11:38,061 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:11:47,683 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.62s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King (e8), rook (a3), rook (b6), bishop (b7), knight (g8), pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8)
- White: King (c2), pawn (g5), pawn (h4)

**Black's advantages:**  
- Massive material advantage (two rooks, bishop, knight, pawns vs. king and two pawns)
- White king is exposed and cut off from the pawns
- Black's pieces are very active and can coordinate for mate or to win the pawns

**Immediate tactics:**  
- White's king is on c2, with no escape squares on the third rank due to the rook on a3.
- The rook on b6 controls the b-file and can swing to the third rank.
- The bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- The knight on g8 is not yet in play, but can be activated.
- Black can try to checkmate the white king or win the remaining pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ra2+** — Check, forces the king to b3 or c1. If Kb3, then Rb2+ wins the king.
2. **Rb2+** — Immediate check, but White can play Kc3.
3. **Ba6** — Prepares to bring the bishop into play, but not forcing.
4. **Rc6+** — Not possible, rook is on b6.
5. **Rook lifts (a3-a2, a3-a1, etc.)** — All checks, but a2 is most forcing.

Let's calculate **1. Ra2+**:

- 1...Ra2+ 2. Kb3 (if Kc1, then Ra1# is mate)
- 2...Rb2+ 3. Kc3 (if Ka3, then Rxa3# is mate)
- 3...Rb3+ 4. Kd4 (only move)
- 4...e5+ 5. Kc5 (if Kd5, then Rb5# is mate)
- 5...Rb5+ 6. Kd6 (if Kc6, then Rc3# is mate)
- 6...Rb6+ 7. Kc7 (if Kd7, then Rb7# is mate)
- 7...Rc6+ 8. Kb7 (if Kd8, then Rc8# is mate)
- 8...Rc7+ 9. Kb8 (if Kc8, then Rc8# is mate)
- 9...Rc8#

But let's check for immediate mate:

- 1...Ra2+ 2. Kc1 (only move, as Kb3 walks into Rb2+)
- 2...Ra1+ 3. Kc2 (only move)
- 3...Be4+ 4. Kd2 (only move)
- 4...Ra2+ 5. Kc1 (only move)
- 5...Rb1#

But after 1...Ra2+ 2. Kc1 Ra1+ 3. Kc2, Black can play Be4+ and then Ra2+ again, repeating, but let's see if there's a forced mate.

Alternatively, after 1...Ra2+ 2. Kb1 (if Kc1, Ra1# is mate), then Rb2+ 3. Kc1 Ra1# is mate.

So, **1...Ra2+** is a forced mate in two if White plays Kc1.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
a3a2+
```

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/1q2pp2/6P1/8/7P/r1K5/8 w k - 35 70

Key features of the position:
1. White's king is at c2, black's at e8
2. Black has a rook on a2 and bishop on b7
3. White has pawns on g5 and h3
4. Black has pawns on f6, e6, and h7
5. Black has a knight on g8
6. White is to move with only 4 legal king moves available

Looking at the legal moves:
1. c2d3 - moves king towards center but exposes to checks
2. c2c3 - moves king towards a-file where black has rook
3. c2d1 - moves king back towards first rank
4. c2c1 - similar to d1 but keeps king on c-file

The most critical factor is that black has mating threats with Ra1# if white's king moves to b2 or b1. We must avoid this at all costs.

After careful consideration:
- c2d3 seems dangerous as it could allow ...Ra3+ followed by ...Rb3+ winning
- c2c3 walks into Ra3+ with similar problems
- c2d1 is safer but still allows ...Ra1+ forcing the king back
- c2c1 is the most resilient as it keeps the king near the corner and doesn't immediately walk into checks

The best move is c2c1, maintaining maximum flexibility while minimizing immediate threats. This keeps the option of moving to d1 next move if needed, and prevents any immediate mating threats.

2025-06-11 22:12:11,362 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.93s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a2), bishop (b7), queen (b6), pawn (h7), pawn (f6), pawn (e6), pawn (g8), pawn (h8)
- White: King (c1), rook (a1), pawn (g5), pawn (h3)

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen, bishop, and two pawns for a rook and two pawns. White's king is on c1, very exposed, and Black's queen and rook are extremely active.
- Black's queen on b6 and rook on a2 are both attacking, and the bishop on b7 is controlling important diagonals.
- White's only hope is to try to create counterplay with the g5 pawn, but Black's king is safe for now.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens Ra1# (checkmate), but White's king is on c1, so that's not possible.
- Black can play Qb2# (checkmate), but the rook on a1 covers b2.
- Black can try to invade with the rook or queen, or look for a forced mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ra1+**: Forces Kd2, then Qb2+ is mate.
2. **Qb2+**: Not possible, rook covers b2.
3. **Qe3+**: King can go to d1 or b1, but then Ra1+ is mate.
4. **Qb3**: Threatens mate on c2, but White can block with Ra2.
5. **Ra3**: Threatens Ra1+ and Qb2+.

But let's check the forced mate:

- **Ra1+**
    - If Kd2, then Qb2+ is mate (rook covers a2, king can't escape).
    - If Kc2, then Qb2+ is mate.

But the king is on c1, so Ra1+ is legal.

So, let's check:

1. Ra1+ Kc2 (only move)
2. Qb2# (checkmate)

Therefore, the best move is:

```
a2a1
```

2025-06-11 22:12:27,952 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.35s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/1q2pp2/6P1/8/7P/8/r1K5 w k - 37 71

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has king + rook + bishop + pawns)
2. White's king is exposed and under pressure
3. Black has a rook on a1 attacking White's pawn on a2
4. White has passed pawns on g5 and h3
5. Black has connected passed pawns on e6 and f6
6. Black's pieces are more active (rook and bishop)

Legal moves are c1d2 or c1c2. Let's evaluate both:

1. c1d2:
- Gets the king slightly more active
- But moves towards Black's rook on a1
- After ...Ra1xa2, White's pawn structure collapses
- Black can then push passed pawns while White's king is too slow

2. c1c2:
- Keeps the king closer to the center
- Protects the a2 pawn
- After ...Ra1xa2+, Kxa2, White can try to push pawns
- But Black's bishop controls key squares for White's king

After deep consideration, c1c2 is slightly better because:
- It maintains the pawn on a2 which is important for creating counterplay
- The king is slightly safer on c2 than d2
- There's a small chance to create counterplay with the g and h pawns

While the position is likely lost for White due to Black's active pieces and connected passed pawns, c1c2 offers the most resistance.

```

2025-06-11 22:12:37,939 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.72s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k1nr/1b5p/1q2pp2/6P1/8/7P/2K5/r7 b k - 38 71

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a1), knight (g8), bishop (b7), queen (b6), pawns (h7, f6, e6)
- White: King (c2), pawn (g5), pawn (h3)

**Immediate observations:**
- Black is up a huge amount of material (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. just a king and two pawns).
- White has no immediate threats.
- Black's king is safe.
- White's king is on c2, with no pawn cover and no pieces to defend.
- Black can deliver mate or force mate in a few moves.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ra2+**: Forces the king to b1 or c1. If Kb1, then Be4+ is mate.
2. **Qf2+**: King must go to c1 or b3. But after Kb3, Qb2# is mate.
3. **Be4+**: King must go to c1 or b3. If Kc1, Ra1# is mate.
4. **Qb2+**: King must go to d3 or c4. But after Kd3, Qe2# is mate.
5. **Qf2+**: As above.

Let’s calculate the most forcing lines:

**1. Ra2+**
- If Kc1, then Qb2+ is mate.
- If Kb1, then Be4+ is mate.

Let’s check:
- 71...Ra2+ 72. Kc1 Qb2+ 73. Kd1 Qd2#
- 71...Ra2+ 72. Kb1 Be4+ 73. Kc1 Qb2+ 74. Kd1 Qd2#

But actually, after 71...Ra2+ 72. Kc1, Qb2+ is mate (since the king can't go to d1 or d3).

**2. Qb2+**
- 71...Qb2+ 72. Kd3 Qe2# (mate)

**3. Qf2+**
- 71...Qf2+ 72. Kc1 (only move) Ra1# (mate)

**4. Be4+**
- 71...Be4+ 72. Kc1 Qb2# (mate)

**5. Qb2+**
- 71...Qb2+ 72. Kd3 Qe2# (mate)

**Conclusion:**
- 71...Qf2+ is mate in 2: 72. Kc1 Ra1#
- 71...Be4+ is mate in 2: 72. Kc1 Qb2#
- 71...Qb2+ is mate in 2: 72. Kd3 Qe2#

All are mate in 2. Let's check for the most forcing and stylish mate.

**71...Qf2+** is the cleanest, as it forces the king to c1, then Ra1# is unavoidable.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
qf2+

2025-06-11 22:13:00,543 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.87s):
Let me analyze this position deeply.

The current FEN shows:
- White: King on c2, pawns on g5 and h3
- Black: King on a2, rook on a4, knight on e4, pawns on a6, e6, f6, h7
- White to move (turn 72)

Key observations:
1. Material is roughly equal (White has K+2P vs Black's K+R+N+4P), but White is down significantly
2. Black's pieces are very active with rook and knight coordinating near White's king
3. White's king is exposed and under pressure
4. The position appears to be a theoretical draw with best play, but one wrong move could lose immediately

Legal moves:
- c2d3: King moves toward center but into potential knight forks
- c2c3: King moves toward black's rook, potentially dangerous
- c2d1: King retreats toward corner
- c2c1: King stays on back rank

After careful consideration:
- c2d3 looks most natural but allows ...Nc3+ winning the g5 pawn
- c2c3 walks into ...Ra2+ skewering the king to the rook
- c2d1 seems safest, keeping options to go to c1 next move if needed
- c2c1 is similar but may allow ...Ra1+ next move

The best practical chance is to head toward the corner where the king is slightly safer from checks. Between d1 and c1, d1 keeps more squares controlled.

Black's main threat is ...Nc3+ winning the g5 pawn, so we need to prevent that while also avoiding rook checks.

2025-06-11 22:13:00,778 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:13:06,642 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.86s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a2, bishop on b7, queen on b6, knight on g8, pawns on f6, e6, h7, h6
- White: King on d1, pawn on h3, g5

**Black's advantages:**
- Massive material advantage: up a queen, rook, bishop, and several pawns.
- White has only a king and two pawns.
- White's king is exposed on d1.
- Black has many ways to check and restrict the white king.

**Immediate tactics:**
- Black can deliver checks with the queen or rook.
- The white king is on d1, and the only escape squares are c1, c2, e1, e2, and c3 (but c3 is covered by the queen).
- The queen on b6 controls the c5, c6, c7, c8, b7, b8, a7, a8, d4, e3, f2, g1 diagonals and files.
- The rook on a2 can swing to the second rank to cut off the king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ra1+**: Forces the king to c2 or e2. If Kc2, then Qb2# is mate. If Ke2, then Qb2+ forces Kd3, then Qb3# is mate.
2. **Qb1+**: Forces the king to e2 or d2. If Ke2, then Qe4+ is strong.
3. **Qg1+**: Not immediately useful.
4. **Qa6**: Not a check, but threatens mate soon.
5. **Ra3**: Not a check, but threatens to swing to a1.

Let's check **Ra1+**:

- 1...Ra1+ 2.Kc2 (if 2.Ke2, then Qb2+ 3.Kd3 Qb3#)
- 2...Qb2# is checkmate.

So, **Ra1+** is a forced mate in 2.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 22:13:21,147 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.27s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/1q2pp2/6P1/8/7P/8/r2K4 w k - 41 73

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has king + rook + bishop + pawns)
2. White's king is exposed and under pressure
3. Black has a rook on a1 and bishop on b7 controlling important squares
4. White has passed pawns on g5 and h3, but they're not immediately dangerous
5. Black's king is relatively safe on e8

Looking at the legal moves:
1. d1e2 - moves king towards center but exposes to bishop checks
2. d1d2 - keeps king more centralized but still exposed
3. d1c2 - moves king towards queenside where there's less immediate danger

The most pressing threat is Black's rook on a1 and potential discovered checks from the bishop. Moving to c2 seems safest as:
- It gets the king away from the a1-h8 diagonal
- It prepares potential opposition against Black's king
- It keeps options to support the queenside pawns if needed

d1d2 would leave the king more exposed to potential rook checks from a2 or bishop checks. d1e2 would walk into more danger from the bishop.

After c2, White can try to push the g-pawn or h-pawn to create counterplay, though the position remains difficult.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Rook (a1), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), Queen (b6), Pawn (f6, e6, h7, h8)
- White: King (c2), Pawn (g5, h3)

**Black is up a huge amount of material:** Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and several pawns vs just two pawns for White. White's king is exposed and Black's pieces are extremely active.

**Immediate threats:**
- White has no real threats; the only hope is to try to promote the g-pawn, but Black can easily stop it.
- Black can look for forced mates or ways to win more material.

**Candidate moves:**
- ...Qb1+ (forces the king to d2 or c3, but then ...Ra2+ is mate)
- ...Ra2+ (if king moves to d3, then ...Qb1+ is mate)
- ...Qb3+ (forces the king to d2 or c1, but then ...Ra1+ is mate)
- ...Qf2+ (forces king to d3, then ...Ra3+ is mate)
- ...Qb1+ is a forcing move.

Let's check ...Qb1+:

1. ...Qb1+ 
    - If Kd2, then ...Ra2+ is mate.
    - If Kc3, then ...Ra3+ is mate.

But the king is on c2, so after ...Qb1+:
- Kd2: ...Ra2+ is mate.
- Kc3: ...Ra3+ is mate.

So ...Qb1+ is a forced mate in 2.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b6b1

2025-06-11 22:13:43,924 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.55s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/2K5/rq6 w k - 43 74

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawns vs Black has king, rook, bishop, pawns)
2. White's king is exposed and under pressure
3. Black has a rook and bishop attacking squares around White's king
4. White has passed pawns on g5 and h3, but they're not immediately dangerous
5. Black's pawns on f6 and e6 are solid
6. Black's rook on a1 is very active

Legal moves are c2c3 or c2d2. Let's analyze both:

1. c2c3:
   - Moves the king towards the center but still leaves it exposed
   - Doesn't address the immediate threats from Black's pieces
   - Black could continue with ...b1a1 pinning the pawn or ...b7c6 activating the bishop

2. c2d2:
   - Moves the king towards relative safety
   - Gets out of the line of fire from Black's rook on a1
   - Prepares to potentially bring the king towards the kingside pawns
   - Still keeps options open for future defense

The position is extremely difficult for White as Black has significant activity with their pieces. However, c2d2 seems slightly better as it:
- Removes the king from immediate threats
- Doesn't create additional weaknesses
- Maintains some flexibility

Between the two options, c2d2 appears to be the more prudent choice, trying to reduce Black's attacking potential while keeping White's pawn structure intact.

2025-06-11 22:13:44,175 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:13:51,979 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.80s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Queen (b1), Rook (a1), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), Pawns (f6, e6, h7)
- White: King (d2), Pawn (g5), Pawn (h3)

**White to move next.**
- Black is up a queen, rook, bishop, and knight for a pawn. White has only two pawns and the king.
- Black's king is relatively safe, and White has no threats.

**Immediate threats:**
- No checks against Black's king.
- White's king is on d2, and Black's queen is on b1, rook on a1, bishop on b7, knight on g8.
- Black can consider mating nets or winning more material.

**Candidate moves:**
- Qb2+ (forces the king to c1 or e3)
- Qd1+ (forces the king to c3 or e3)
- Qc2+ (forces the king to e3)
- Ra2+ (forces the king to e3 or c1)
- Qe4 (centralizes queen, but not as forcing)
- Qb4+ (forces king to e3 or c1)
- f6-f5 (not urgent, White has no threats)
- h7-h6 (not urgent)
- Ne7 or Nh6 (develops, but not urgent)

**Best plan:** 
- Deliver checks and force the king to the edge, then coordinate pieces for mate.
- Qb2+ is the most forcing move, as it limits the king's options.

**Let's check Qb2+:**
- 1... Qb2+ 2. Ke3 (if Kd1, then Qd1# is mate)
- 1... Qb2+ 2. Kd3 (illegal, as b2 covers d3)
- 1... Qb2+ 2. Kd1 (then Qd1# is mate)

So, Qb2+ is a direct mate threat.

**Let's check Qd1+:**
- 1... Qd1+ 2. Ke3 (if Kc3, then Qc2# is mate)
- 1... Qd1+ 2. Kc3 Qc2# (mate)

**Let's check Qc2+:**
- 1... Qc2+ 2. Ke3 (if Kd1, then Qd1# is mate)
- 1... Qc2+ 2. Kd1 Qd1# (mate)

**Let's check Ra2+:**
- 1... Ra2+ 2. Ke3 (if Kc1, then Qc2# is mate)
- 1... Ra2+ 2. Kc1 Qc2# (mate)

All these moves lead to mate in one or two.

**But Qd1+ is mate in one if White goes to c3, otherwise mate in two.**

**But Qd1+ is the most forcing:**
- 1... Qd1+ 2. Kc3 Qc2# (mate)
- 1... Qd1+ 2. Ke3 Qe2# (mate)

So, Qd1+ is the best move.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-11 22:14:10,373 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.14s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/7P/3K4/r2q4 w k - 45 75

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and some minor pieces)
2. Black has a very active queen on d1 and rook on a1
3. White's king is exposed on d2
4. Black's king is somewhat exposed on e8
5. White has a passed g-pawn that's advanced to g5
6. Black has a bishop on b7 controlling the long diagonal

Legal moves are d2e3 or d2c3. Both moves aim to get the king to safer squares while maintaining control.

Let's evaluate both options:

1. d2e3:
- Gets the king off the d-file away from Black's rook
- But moves towards Black's queen on d1
- After ...Qc1+, we'd have to go back to d3 or e2
- Doesn't immediately solve our problems

2. d2c3:
- Moves the king towards the queenside where it might be safer
- Covers the b2 square
- Potentially allows future coordination with our pieces
- After ...Qc1+, we can go to b3
- Might be able to eventually activate our pieces better

Looking deeper at d2c3:
- Black's most dangerous reply seems to be Qc1+
- Then Kb3 (forced)
- Black can play Qb1+ Ka3 (but then Qa1+ Kb3 and we're repeating)
- Alternatively Black could try other moves like ...Ra2 or ...Bc6

The d2c3 move seems more promising as it:
1) Gets the king away from the most dangerous lines
2) Potentially allows future piece coordination
3) Maintains more flexibility
4) Keeps options to advance our passed g-pawn

After careful consideration, I believe d2c3 is the better choice here as it offers more long-term prospects while reducing immediate dangers.

2025-06-11 22:14:17,700 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.04s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position after 75...**
- Black: King e8, rook a1, queen d1, bishop b7, knight g8, pawns f6, e6, h7, h3
- White: King c3, pawn g5, h4

**Material:**
- Black is up a queen, rook, bishop, and two pawns for a rook and two pawns. White has no pieces except pawns and king.

**Threats:**
- White has no immediate threats. Black's pieces dominate.
- Black can deliver mate or force resignation with accurate play.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the king to b3 or d3. If Kb3, then Qa4+ wins the king.
2. **Qd4+**: Forces the king to b3 or c2.
3. **Qd3+**: Similar idea.
4. **Ra3+**: King must move.
5. **Qd8+**: Not as forcing.
6. **Qd3+**: King moves, then Ra3+.

But the most forcing is to check with the queen or rook.

Let's look at **Qa1+**:
- 76...Qa1+ 77. Kb3 (if Kd3, then Qd1+ and mate soon)
- 77...Qa4+ 78. Kc3 (if Kb2, then Qb4+ and mate)
- 78...Qa3+ 79. Kd2 (if Kc2, then Be4+ and mate)
- 79...Qb2+ 80. Ke1 (if Ke3, then Qc1+ and mate)
- 80...Qc1+ 81. Kf2 Qe1# (mate)

Alternatively, **Qd4+**:
- 76...Qd4+ 77. Kb3 (if Kc2, then Be4+ and mate)
- 77...Qa4+ 78. Kc3 (as above)
- 78...Qa3+ 79. Kd2 Qb2+ and mate soon.

But **Qa1+** is the most direct and forces the king to the edge.

**Check for stalemate traps:** White has pawns on g5 and h4, so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:** The best move is the most forcing check:

2025-06-11 22:14:38,530 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.43s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/8/r1K4P/8/3q4 w k - 47 76

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and some pawns)
2. White's king is exposed on c3
3. Black has a rook on a3 and queen on d1, both attacking white's position
4. White has passed pawns on g5 and h3
5. Black has pawns on f6, e6, and h7
6. Black's king is on e8 with a knight on g8

Legal moves: c3c4, c3b4, c3b2

Let's evaluate each option:

1. c3b2:
   - Gets the king away from immediate threats
   - But moves towards black's queen on d1 (Qd1xb3 could be threatened)
   - May allow black to coordinate better with Ra3-a2

2. c3b4:
   - Moves king towards the queenside
   - Potentially threatens to advance pawns there
   - But leaves the h-pawn undefended
   - Black could play Qd1xh3

3. c3c4:
   - Moves king towards center
   - Keeps defense of h3 pawn
   - Prepares potential king march to support passed g-pawn
   - Black's immediate threats seem manageable

After careful consideration, c3c4 seems most prudent because:
- It maintains defense of the h3 pawn
- The king is slightly safer in the center than on the b-file
- It doesn't immediately walk into any discovered attacks
- It keeps options open for both defending and supporting pawn advances

The other moves either expose the king more or give up important pawns. While the position remains complex, c3c4 gives White the most flexibility to respond to Black's threats while maintaining all options.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Queen (d1), Rook (a3), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), Pawns (f6, e6, h7)
- White: King (c4), Pawn (g5), Pawn (h3)

**Black to move.**

**King Safety:**
- Black's king is relatively safe on e8.
- White's king is exposed on c4.

**Threats:**
- White has no immediate threats. The pawn on g5 is not dangerous yet.
- Black has a huge material advantage and can look for a forced mate or decisive material gain.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Qd1d5+**: Check, forces the king to move.
2. **Qd1a4+**: Check, king must move.
3. **Ra3a4+**: Check, king must move.
4. **Qd1c2+**: Check, king must move.
5. **Qd1d4+**: Check, king must move.
6. **Qd1a1**: Not a check, but attacks the h1 square.
7. **Qd1d3**: Not a check, but attacks the c3 square.

Let's analyze the checks:

**1. Qd1d5+**
- White's only move is Kb4 (if Kc3, then Qc4#).
- After Kb4, Black can play Qd4+.
- If Kb3, then Qc4#.
- If Kb5, then Qc6+ and then mate follows.

**2. Qd1a4+**
- White's only move is Kc5.
- Then Qc6+ is mate.

**3. Ra3a4+**
- White's only move is Kc5.
- Then Qd5+.
- If Kb6, Qc6#.
- If Kb5, Qc6+ and mate follows.

**4. Qd1c2+**
- White's only move is Kb4.
- Then Qc4+.
- If Ka5, Qxa4#.
- If Ka3, Qb3#.

**5. Qd1d4+**
- White's only move is Kb5.
- Then Qc6+ and mate follows.

**Best Move:**
- All these checks are strong, but **Qd1a4+** is the most direct, as after Kc5, Qc6# is mate.

**Final Move:**
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/6P1/q1K5/r6P/8/8 w k - 49 77

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + pawn + knight)
2. White's king is exposed but currently safe
3. Black has a passed a-pawn that's far advanced (a2)
4. White's g-pawn is passed but blockaded by the knight
5. Black's knight is very active on g3
6. Only legal move is c4c5 (pawn push)

The position appears to be a theoretical draw with best play, but we must make the most of our chances. The c4-c5 push serves multiple purposes:
1. Creates a passed pawn on c5
2. Gains space in the center
3. Potentially opens lines for the king to become more active
4. Limits Black's options

Black's main threats are:
- Advancing the a-pawn
- Using the knight to harass White's king
- Potentially bringing the king to support the a-pawn

After c4-c5, possible continuations:
- If ...a1=Q, then Kb3 with counterplay against Black's king
- If ...Kd7, then Kb5 to support the c-pawn
- If ...Nf5, then Kd5 to centralize

This move maintains maximum flexibility while creating our own passed pawn. It's the only way to make progress in the position.

2025-06-11 22:15:01,777 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:15:07,209 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.43s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/2K3P1/q7/r6P/8/8 b k - 50 77

- Black: King e8, rook a3, queen a4, bishop b7, knight g8, pawns f6, e6, h7, h3.
- White: King c5, pawn g5, h3.

**Material:** Black is up a queen, rook, bishop, and knight for a pawn. White's king is advanced but has no support. Black's king is safe. There are no immediate threats to Black.

**Short-term tactics:**
- White has no checks.
- Black can check with Qa5+ or Ra5+.
- Black can also play ...Ra5+ to force the king back.
- ...Qa5+ is also possible, but after Kd6, White's king is still active.

**Long-term strategy:**
- Black should avoid stalemate tricks.
- Black should use the extra material to force mate or win more material.
- Avoid perpetual checks or stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa5+**: Checks the king. After Kd6, Black can continue with Qb6+ or Ra6+.
2. **Ra5+**: Checks the king. After Kb6, Black can play Qa5# (mate).
3. **Qa3**: Not a check, but attacks the pawn on h3.
4. **Ra2**: Not a check, but attacks the second rank.
5. **e5**: Opens up the bishop, but not urgent.

Let's check **Ra5+**:

- 1...Ra5+ 2.Kb6 Qa5# (mate)

This is checkmate in two moves.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
ra5+
```

2025-06-11 22:15:28,627 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.10s):
Let me analyze this position deeply. The current FEN is `4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/q1K3P1/8/r6P/8/8 w k - 51 78`, meaning it's White's move (the king is on c5).

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen and some pawns)
2. Black has a very active queen on a5 attacking our pawn on g5
3. Black's rook on a3 is very active
4. Our king is somewhat exposed on c5
5. Black has a passed pawn on f6 that could become dangerous

Legal moves are c5d6, c5d4, c5c4. Let's evaluate each:

1. c5d6:
   - Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks from black's queen
   - After Qa5-d8+ we'd have to move back or go to e7 where Black can play ...f5 with counterplay
   - Doesn't improve our position significantly

2. c5d4:
   - Moves king towards our pawns but away from defending g5 pawn
   - Black can play Qa5-d8+ forcing Kd4-c4, then ...Ra3-a4+ winning the g5 pawn
   - This seems dangerous as we'd lose our passed pawn

3. c5c4:
   - Keeps king protecting g5 pawn
   - Moves king closer to our pawns for potential support
   - After Qa5-d8+ we can play Kc4-b3 maintaining protection of g5
   - Limits Black's immediate counterplay options

After careful consideration, Kc4 seems most resilient:
- It maintains protection of the g5 pawn
- It prepares to potentially support our h-pawn's advance
- It limits Black's queen checks
- It keeps our king relatively safe from immediate threats

The other moves either expose our king too much or lose material. While the position remains complex, Kc4 gives us the best chances to maintain our position and look for future opportunities.

2025-06-11 22:15:36,000 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.14s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King e8, rook a3, rook a5, bishop b7, knight g8, pawns f6, e6, h7, h8
- White: King c4, pawn g5, pawn h3

**Black is up a huge amount of material:** two rooks, a bishop, and a knight for just a couple of pawns. White's king is exposed on c4, and Black's pieces are very active.

**Immediate threats:**
- White has no immediate threats. The pawn on g5 is not dangerous.
- Black can try to checkmate the white king or win the remaining pawns.

**Candidate moves:**
- a5a4+ (check, king must move)
- a3a4+ (same as above)
- a5c5+ (check, king must move)
- a5a3 (double up rooks)
- f6g5 (take pawn)
- h7h6/h7h5 (pawn moves, not urgent)
- g8e7/g8h6 (knight moves, not urgent)
- e6e5 (pawn move, not urgent)

**Tactical considerations:**
- a5a4+ or a3a4+ forces the king to b3 or d3.
- a5c5+ forces the king to d4 or b4.
- After a check, Black can coordinate the rooks to cut off the king and deliver mate.

**Best plan:** 
- Use the rooks to cut off the king and force it to the edge, then deliver mate with the help of the bishop if needed.

**Let's check a5a4+:**
- 1... a5a4+ 2. Kb3 (if Kd3, then a4a3+ is very strong)
- Then a3a4+ is possible, but let's see if we can coordinate the rooks better.

**What about a5c5+:**
- 1... a5c5+ 2. Kd4 or Kb4
- If Kd4, then Rc4+ wins the king.
- If Kb4, then Rb5+ wins the king.

**What about a3a4+:**
- 1... a3a4+ 2. Kb3 (if Kd3, then a4a3+ is very strong)
- Then a5a3+ is possible.

**What about f6g5:**
- 1... f6g5 2. Kd4 (king tries to run)
- Not as forcing as the rook checks.

**Conclusion:**
- The most forcing move is a5c5+, which checks the king and keeps the king boxed in. After that, Black can continue to check and force the king to the edge, where mate will be easy.

**Final move:**
```
a5c5+
```

2025-06-11 22:15:57,081 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.81s):
Let me analyze the position deeply:

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/2q3P1/2K5/r6P/8/8 w k - 53 79

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + pawn + knight)
2. White's king is more active (c4 vs black's king on e8)
3. Black has a passed a-pawn that's very advanced (a2)
4. White has a passed g-pawn on g5
5. Black's knight is somewhat trapped on h8
6. Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on f6

The only legal move is c4c5, which is a pawn move. Let's evaluate its consequences:

Advantages of c4c5:
- Gains space in the center
- Potentially opens lines for the king
- May create a passed pawn if we can push c6 later
- Restricts black's king movement

Disadvantages:
- Creates a potential weakness if the pawn can't be defended
- May allow black counterplay with ...a1=Q

However, looking at alternatives:
- We have no other legal moves (only c4c5 is possible)
- Not moving would be stalemate or loss on time

The move c4c5 is actually quite strong because:
1. It threatens to create a passed pawn with c6
2. Black can't stop both the c-pawn and g-pawn
3. Black's pieces are poorly coordinated to stop both pawns
4. Our king can support the pawn advance

After c4c5, black's best try is probably ...a1=Q, but then:
- c5c6 Qa4+ Kb5 Qb3+ Ka5 and the c-pawn queens
- Or if ...Kd7 then g6 and the g-pawn will queen

The position is winning for white despite the material deficit because our pawns are more dangerous and our king is better placed.

2025-06-11 22:15:58,267 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:16:03,179 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.91s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a3), bishop (b7), knight (g8), pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8)
- White: King (c5), pawn (h4), pawn (g5)

**Key points:**
- Black is up a rook, bishop, and knight for two pawns.
- White's king is advanced but has no immediate threats.
- Black's rook on a3 is very active.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls long diagonals.
- Black's king is safe.
- White's only hope is to push the g/h pawns, but they are easily blockaded.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a3a5**: Cuts off the White king from advancing on the c-file and threatens to invade via a4.
2. **a3a4**: Similar idea, but a5 is more flexible.
3. **f6g5**: Trades off a White pawn, but White can recapture with h4xg5, opening the h-file.
4. **h7h6**: Prevents White from playing h6, but not urgent.
5. **e6e5**: Centralizes, but not urgent.
6. **g8e7**: Brings the knight into play, but not urgent.
7. **e8f7**: Activates the king, but not urgent.

**Best plan:**
- Black should cut off the White king and prepare to invade with the rook, then bring the king up and use the extra material to win. There is no immediate threat from White, so Black can play for domination.

**Best move:**
- **a3a5** is the most precise. It cuts off the White king, keeps the rook active, and prepares to invade the queenside or swing to the kingside if needed.

**Final move:**
```
a3a5

2025-06-11 22:16:20,694 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.58s):
Let me analyze this position carefully. The FEN is: `4k1nr/1b5p/4pp2/r1K3P1/8/7P/8/8 w k - 1 80`

Key features of the position:
1. Material: White has king and pawns vs Black's king, bishop, rook, and pawns
2. White's king is on c5, black's on e8
3. White has passed pawns on g5 and h3, black has pawns on f6, h7, and a rook on a5
4. Black has a bishop on b7 controlling the long diagonal
5. White's immediate concern is king safety and pawn promotion

Legal moves are king moves: c5d6, c5b6, c5d4, c5c4, c5b4

Let's evaluate each:
1. c5d6 - moves towards black's king but exposes to checks from rook
2. c5b6 - moves away from rook but towards bishop's control
3. c5d4 - centralizes king but still in rook's line
4. c5c4 - moves towards queenside but away from passed pawns
5. c5b4 - moves away from rook but into bishop's diagonal

Best seems c5d4:
- Centralizes the king
- Prepares to support the g-pawn's advance
- If black checks with Ra4+, we can respond Kd3 maintaining control
- Keeps options to go to e4 or c4 next
- Doesn't walk into immediate bishop attacks

Other moves either walk into bishop control or don't improve king position as effectively. The g-pawn is our best chance for promotion, so we should position the king to support it.

2025-06-11 22:16:22,179 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:16:29,133 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.95s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a5), bishop (b7), knight (g8), pawns (f6, e6, h7, h8)
- White: King (d4), pawn (g5, h3)

**Position:**
- Black is up a bishop and a rook for two pawns. White's king is active but exposed.
- Black's rook on a5 is very active, cutting off the White king from the queenside.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal and can support both defense and offense.
- Black's king is safe for now.
- White's only hope is to create counterplay with the g5 pawn and king activity.

**Immediate threats:**
- White has no immediate threats. The pawn on g5 is not dangerous yet.
- Black can consider moves to improve piece placement, restrict the White king, and prepare to advance pawns or deliver mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a5a4**: Cuts off the White king further, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
2. **a5g5**: Rook takes the pawn, but after h4, White can try to create a passed pawn.
3. **f6g5**: Pawn takes pawn, but then h4 and White can try to create a passed pawn.
4. **h7h6**: Prevents White from pushing h4, but not urgent.
5. **e6e5+**: Check, but White can play Kc5 or Kd3, and Black loses the e-pawn.
6. **g8e7**: Develops the knight, but not urgent.
7. **e8f7**: Centralizes the king, but not urgent.

**Best plan:**
- Black should aim to eliminate White's kingside pawns and then use the material advantage to win.
- Taking on g5 with the pawn is best, as it eliminates White's most advanced pawn and keeps the rook on the active a-file.

**Calculation:**
- 1... f6xg5 2. h4 (trying to create a passed pawn) gxh4 3. Ke5 (trying to activate the king) Kf7 (centralizing the king, ready to support the h-pawn advance)
- Black can then bring the rook to the h-file and mop up the h-pawn, or use the bishop to support promotion.

**Tactics:**
- There are no immediate tactics for White.
- Black's plan is simple: eliminate White's pawns, then use the extra rook and bishop to win.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to take the g5 pawn with the f6 pawn.

My move is:
```
f6g5

2025-06-11 22:16:44,610 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.22s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current position:
- White has king on d4 and pawn on h3
- Black has king on e8, pawns on e6/g5, rook on a2, and knight on g8
- White to move

Key observations:
1. Material is roughly equal (White has pawn, Black has knight)
2. Black's rook is very active on a2, threatening to promote the a-pawn
3. White's king is more centralized but needs to prevent Black's threats
4. The h-pawn is White's only chance for counterplay

Candidate moves:
1. d4c4 - moves king towards queenside to stop a-pawn
2. d4e3 - centralizes king more
3. d4d3 - retreats king
4. d4c3 - moves towards queenside
5. h3h4 - advances passed pawn

Analysis:
- h3h4 seems most forcing, creating immediate counterplay
- If we don't push h4, Black can play ...a1=Q next move with strong threats
- After h4, if ...gxh4, we get a passed h-pawn
- If ...a1=Q, hxg5 gives us a dangerous passed pawn
- Other king moves allow Black to promote with tempo

Best move is to create immediate counterplay with the h-pawn while our king can still defend against Black's threats. This gives us drawing chances at least, and possibly winning chances if Black mishandles the position.

2025-06-11 22:16:51,633 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.17s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r5p1/3K3P/8/8/8 b k - 0 81

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a5), bishop (b7), knight (g8), pawns (e6, h7, g5)
- White: King (d4), pawn (h4)

**Positional factors:**
- Black is up a bishop, rook, and knight for a pawn. White has only a king and a pawn.
- Black's king is safe. White's king is exposed.
- Black's rook is active on a5, bishop is on b7, knight on g8 (not developed), but White has no counterplay.

**Short-term tactics:**
- Black can consider pushing the g-pawn (g5-g4), activating the knight, or improving the rook.
- White's only hope is to push the h-pawn, but it's easily blockaded.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g5-g4**: Kicks the White king, restricts its movement, and prepares to bring the knight to f6 or h6.
2. **a5-a4**: Cuts off the White king from the 4th rank, but not urgent.
3. **h7-h6**: Prepares h5, but not necessary.
4. **g8-f6**: Develops the knight, but g4 is more forcing.
5. **e6-e5+**: Checks, but White can go to e3 or c5, not decisive.

**Deep analysis:**
- **g4**: After g4, White's king is forced to move. If Kd4-e5, then Ra4 or Ra6 is possible, and the king is cut off. If Kd4-c5, then Rc5+ wins the pawn. Black can then bring the knight or bishop to help.
- **g8-f6**: Develops, but not as forcing as g4.
- **a5-a4**: Not as urgent.

**Conclusion:**
- **g4** is the most forcing and restricts White's king, making it easier to mop up the h-pawn and force mate.

**Final move:**
```
g5g4

2025-06-11 22:16:52,637 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:17:08,137 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.50s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r7/3K2pP/8/8/8 w k - 0 82

Key features:
1. Material: White has king (d4) and pawn (h4) vs Black has king (e8), rook (a5), bishop (b7), pawn (g4), and pawn (h7)
2. White is significantly down in material
3. Black's pawns are advanced but not yet queened
4. White's h-pawn is passed but far from promotion
5. Black's pieces are active and coordinated

Legal moves: d4c4, d4e3, d4d3, d4c3, h4h5

Analysis of each move:
1. h4h5 - pushes the pawn but allows Black to play g4-g3 creating a passed pawn
2. d4c4 - moves away from Black's threats but doesn't stop g4-g3
3. d4e3 - blocks the g-pawn but allows Ra4 pinning the king
4. d4d3 - moves toward the center but doesn't address immediate threats
5. d4c3 - best option as it prevents Ra4 and keeps options to stop g-pawn

The best move is d4c3 because:
- It prevents Black from playing Ra4 pinning the king
- It keeps the option to move to d2 to block the g-pawn if needed
- It maintains some control over key squares
- It's the most flexible move in a difficult position

While the position is lost for White, this move prolongs resistance the most.

2025-06-11 22:17:09,173 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:17:15,470 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.30s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position Overview:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a5, bishop on b7, knight on g8, pawns on e6, h7, g4
- White: King on c3, pawn on h4

**Material:**
- Black is up a rook, bishop, and two pawns for a knight.
- White has only a king and a pawn on h4.

**Threats:**
- White's only hope is to push the h-pawn and try to queen.
- Black's king is safe, and Black has overwhelming material.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **a5a3**: Rook to a3, cutting off the king and preparing Ra4+.
2. **g4g3**: Pushes the pawn, threatening g2 and g1=Q.
3. **h7h6**: Prepares to meet h5 with g3.
4. **e6e5**: Opens the bishop and gives the king more space.
5. **g8e7**: Develops the knight, but not urgent.
6. **a5a4**: Rook to a4, preparing to check on a3.

**Deeper Analysis:**
- **g4g3** is very strong: If White plays h5, then g2 and g1=Q is unstoppable.
- If White tries to bring the king closer, Black can check with Ra3 or Ra4.
- Black's plan should be to push the g-pawn and queen as quickly as possible.

**Tactical Check:**
- After **g4g3**, White has no way to stop g2 and g1=Q.
- If White plays h5, then g2, h6, g1=Q, h7, Qg7# is mate.

**Conclusion:**
- **g4g3** is the fastest and most direct way to win. It creates an unstoppable passed pawn and threatens immediate queening.

**Final Move:**
```
g4g3

2025-06-11 22:17:37,156 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.73s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r7/7P/2K3p1/8/8 w k - 0 83

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + bishop + pawn)
2. White's pawn on h4 is passed but blockaded by Black's g3 pawn
3. Black's bishop controls the a8-h1 diagonal
4. Black's rook is active on a5
5. White's king is somewhat exposed

Looking at the legal moves:
- King moves: c3d4, c3c4, c3b4, c3d3, c3b3, c3d2, c3c2, c3b2
- Pawn moves: h4h5

The most critical factor is that Black's g3 pawn is one square away from promotion. White must prevent this at all costs while trying to advance the h-pawn.

Let's evaluate the king moves:
1. c3d4 - moves towards the center but allows ...g2 with threats
2. c3c4 - safer but doesn't address the g-pawn
3. c3b4 - risky as it walks into checks from the rook
4. c3d3 - better, controls g2 square
5. c3b3 - similar to b4 but less exposed
6. c3d2/c3c2/c3b2 - too passive

The pawn move h4h5 is interesting as it threatens to advance, but it allows ...g2 immediately which is dangerous.

After careful consideration, c3d3 is the most precise move:
- It controls the g2 square, preventing ...g2
- It keeps options to go to e3 or c3 next move
- It doesn't expose the king to checks
- It maintains flexibility in the position

Other moves either allow immediate ...g2 or expose the king unnecessarily.

2025-06-11 22:17:42,715 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.66s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a5), bishop (b7), knight (g8), pawns (e6, h7, g3)
- White: King (d3), pawn (h4)

**Position:**
- Black is up a full rook and bishop, and has a dangerous passed g3 pawn.
- White's king is cut off from the kingside and cannot stop the g-pawn.
- White's only pawn is on h4, far from promotion and easily blockaded.
- Black's king is safe, and White has no counterplay.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens to promote the g-pawn with g2, which White cannot stop.
- White's king is far from the action and cannot assist.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g2: Immediate push to promote, but White can play h5, but it doesn't change anything.
2. a5a3: Try to distract the king, but unnecessary.
3. h7h6/h7h5: Slow, doesn't help.
4. e6e5: Opens up the bishop, but not needed.
5. Any king move: Not needed.
6. Any knight move: Not needed.

**Best move:**
- g2 is the most direct. After g2, White cannot stop g1=Q next move. If White plays h5, Black plays g1=Q and wins easily.

**Conclusion:**
- The fastest and most decisive way to win is to push the g-pawn.

2025-06-11 22:18:03,582 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 19.95s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.

**Position Overview:**
- White has a king on d3 and a pawn on h4
- Black has a king on e8, rook on a5, bishop on b7, pawn on e6, pawn on g2, and knight on g8
- White is to move (84th move)

**Material Count:**
- White: King + h-pawn
- Black: King, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and two pawns
- Black is up a significant amount of material (rook + bishop + knight + pawns vs just a pawn)

**Key Observations:**
1. White is in a completely lost position material-wise
2. The only hope is to promote the h-pawn, but it's very far from queening
3. Black has multiple threats including pushing the g-pawn which is close to promotion
4. White's king is somewhat active but can't stop all of Black's threats

**Candidate Moves:**
1. h4h5 - advances the pawn but leaves it vulnerable to ...g2-g1=Q next move
2. King moves - none seem to help as Black can just push the g-pawn

**Best Practical Chance:**
The only way to create any counterplay is to push the h-pawn as fast as possible while trying to delay Black's promotion. 

After h4h5:
- If Black plays g2-g1=Q immediately, we can try to run with the h-pawn
- If Black takes time to capture our pawn with ...Kf7/Kf8, we might gain a tempo

Other moves like king moves don't help as Black can just push the g-pawn. For example:
- d3d4 allows ...g2-g1=Q with check
- d3e3 allows ...g2-g1=Q with check

**Conclusion:**
We must push the h-pawn immediately to create some counterplay. While the position is almost certainly lost, this gives us the best practical chances.

2025-06-11 22:18:09,815 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.56s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a5, knight on g8, bishop on b7, pawns on e6, h7, g2
- White: King on d3, pawn on h5

**Key features:**
- Black is up a lot of material (rook, bishop, knight, and two pawns vs. just a king and pawn).
- White's only hope is to promote the h5 pawn, but Black's g2 pawn is about to promote as well.
- Black's king is safe, and White's king is far from the action.
- Black has many ways to win, but the fastest is to promote the g2 pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. g2g1=Q (promote to queen)
2. g2g1=R (promote to rook)
3. g2g1=B (promote to bishop)
4. g2g1=N (promote to knight)
5. h7h6 (wait move)
6. a5a4 (rook move)
7. e6e5 (pawn move)
8. King moves (but king is safe)

**Analysis:**
- Promoting to a queen with g2g1=Q is the most direct way to win. White cannot stop the mate threats that will follow.
- Underpromoting to a rook or bishop is unnecessary.
- Underpromoting to a knight is not useful here.
- Any other move is slower and gives White more time to try to promote the h5 pawn.

**Check for stalemate or perpetual:**
- Promoting to a queen does not stalemate White. White's king has moves, and Black can easily avoid stalemate.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to promote the g2 pawn to a queen.

**Final move:**
```
g2g1q
```

2025-06-11 22:18:24,971 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.70s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r6P/8/3K4/8/6q1 w k - 0 85

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + queen + rook + bishop + pawn)
2. White is in a completely lost position material-wise
3. Black has multiple threats including Qg1-g2 mate
4. White's only hope is to somehow promote the h-pawn or create perpetual checks

Legal moves: d3c4, d3c3, d3e2, d3d2, d3c2, h5h6

Let's evaluate each option:

1. h5h6 - This pushes the pawn but allows Qg1-g2# immediately
2. d3c4 - Moves away from threats but doesn't address mate
3. d3c3 - Similar to c4, still allows mate
4. d3e2 - Gets closer to the pawn but still allows Qg2#
5. d3d2 - Might help support the pawn but Qg2# is still coming
6. d3c2 - This is interesting as it prevents Qg1-g2 due to the pin on the g-file

The only move that doesn't immediately lose is d3c2, as it prevents the mate threat by pinning the queen to the king. While the position is still lost, this at least forces Black to find another way to win rather than delivering immediate mate.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a5, bishop on b7, queen on g1, pawn on h7, knight on g8, pawn on e6
- White: King on c2, pawn on h5

**Black to move.**

**Threats and evaluation:**
- White's king is on c2, very exposed.
- Black has a queen on g1, rook on a5, bishop on b7, and a knight on g8 (not yet developed).
- White has only a pawn on h5.
- Black is completely winning; White has no counterplay.

**Immediate tactics:**
- Black can checkmate in one move with Qf2#.

**Calculation:**
- 1... Qf2# is checkmate. The White king on c2 cannot escape; all squares are covered.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to deliver checkmate immediately.

Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r6P/8/8/2K2q2/8 w k - 2 86

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + bishop + pawn)
2. White's pawn on h5 is advanced but blockaded by Black's h7 pawn
3. Black has a very active queen on f2 attacking White's king
4. White's king is somewhat exposed but has some squares available
5. Black's bishop on b7 is controlling important diagonals
6. Black's rook on a5 is active but not immediately threatening

The immediate threat is that Black's queen is attacking our king from f2, and any move that allows Qxc2 would be mate. We must keep our king protected from this threat.

Looking at the legal moves:
1. c2d3 - moves king towards center but into bishop's diagonal (b7-f3)
2. c2c3 - keeps king protected from queen but still in bishop's diagonal
3. c2b3 - moves king away from threats but towards Black's rook
4. c2d1 - moves king back but may be too passive
5. c2c1 - keeps king protected but may be too passive
6. c2b1 - moves king towards corner but away from immediate threats

The best move appears to be c2b1 because:
- It gets the king away from the queen's attack
- It's not in the bishop's diagonal
- It prepares potential opposition in some pawn endgames
- It's the furthest from Black's active pieces
- It doesn't immediately walk into any new threats

Other moves have more problems:
- c2d3 walks into bishop's diagonal
- c2c3 is still in bishop's diagonal
- c2d1/c1 are too passive and keep king near threats
- c2b3 walks towards the rook

After c2b1, Black's most likely continuation would be to push their h-pawn or try to activate their rook further, but our king will be relatively safe in the corner.

2025-06-11 22:18:49,060 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:18:54,925 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.86s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King e8, rook a5, bishop b7, knight g8, pawn h7, queen f2
- White: King b1, pawn h5

**Black's turn.**

**Threats and evaluation:**
- Black is up a queen, rook, bishop, and knight for a pawn. White has only a king and a pawn.
- White's only hope is to try to promote the h-pawn, but Black can easily stop it.
- Black's queen is on f2, controlling the second rank and many squares.
- Black's rook is on a5, cutting off the b-file and 5th rank.
- Black's bishop is on b7, controlling the long diagonal.
- Black's knight is on g8, not developed but not needed.
- Black's king is safe on e8.

**Immediate tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate? Let's look for checks:
    - Qe1+ (f2e1): King can only go to b2.
    - Qb2+ (f2b2): King must go to b2.
    - Qb2+ is mate if the king is on b2, but currently king is on b1.
    - Ra1+ is not possible.
    - Qf5+ is not useful.
    - Qe1+ Kb2 Qe2+ Kb1 Qd1+ Ka2 Qc2+ Ka1 Qb2# (but king can't go to a2).

- Let's try Qe1+:
    - 1... Qe1+ 2. Ka2 (only move)
    - 2... Bd5+ (b7d5+), king must go to b2
    - 3... Qd2+ (f2d2+), king must go to b1
    - 4... Qa2# (f2a2#), checkmate.

So, the forced mate is:
1... Qe1+ 2. Ka2 Bd5+ 3. Kb2 Qd2+ 4. Kb1 Qa2#

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f2e1
```

2025-06-11 22:19:09,895 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.73s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r6P/8/8/8/1K2q3 w k - 4 87

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black has king + queen)
2. White's pawn on h5 is advanced but blockaded by Black's h7 pawn
3. Black's queen is very active and controls many squares
4. White's king is somewhat exposed
5. Black has a passed pawn on e6 that could become dangerous
6. White's only legal moves are king moves: b1c2 or b1b2

Let's evaluate both options:

1. b1c2:
- Moves the king towards the center
- Potentially opens up checks from Black's queen
- Might allow Black to push the e-pawn with tempo
- Doesn't immediately address the threat of Black's queen

2. b1b2:
- Moves the king away from the center but towards the h-pawn
- Potentially safer as it reduces queen checks
- Keeps the king closer to the h-pawn which is White's only hope
- Might allow Black to activate their rook more easily

After careful consideration, b1b2 seems slightly better because:
- It reduces immediate queen checks
- It brings the king closer to the h-pawn which is White's only winning chance
- It maintains more flexibility in the position
- The king is slightly less exposed on b2 than c2

The position is extremely difficult for White, but b1b2 offers the best practical chances to hold the position and potentially create counterplay with the h-pawn in the future.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r6P/8/8/1K6/4q3 b k - 5 87

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Rook (a5), Bishop (b7), Queen (e1), Pawn (h7), Knight (g8), Pawn (e6)
- White: King (b2), Pawn (h5)

**White threats:**  
White has no immediate threats. The king is on b2, far from the action. The pawn on h5 is not dangerous yet.

**Black's plan:**  
Black is up massive material (queen, rook, bishop, knight vs. lone king and pawn). The goal is to checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate checks:**
- Qe2+ (e1e2): King to a1 or b1.
- Qb1+ (e1b1): King to a3 or a1.
- Ra1+ (a5a1): King to c3 or b3.
- Ra2+ (a5a2): King to c3 or b3.

But let's check for forced mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qe2+**: King must go to a1 or b1.
   - If Kb1, then Be4+ is mate.
   - If Ka3, then Ra4# is mate.

2. **Ra2+**: King to c3 or b3.
   - If Kc3, Qc1+ Kb3 Qc4#.
   - If Kb3, Qb1+ Ka3 Ra4#.

3. **Ra1+**: King to c3 or b3.
   - If Kc3, Qc1+ Kb3 Qc4#.
   - If Kb3, Qb1+ Ka3 Ra4#.

4. **Qb1+**: King to a3 or a1.
   - If Ka3, Ra4#.
   - If Ka1, Ra1#.

**Let's check Qb1+:**
- Qb1+ Ka3 Ra4# (mate)
- Qb1+ Ka1 Ra1# (mate)

**Therefore, Qb1+ is a forced mate in 2.**

**Final move:**
```
e1b1

2025-06-11 22:19:32,083 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.40s):
Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r6P/8/8/1K6/1q6 w k - 6 88

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + bishop + pawn)
2. White's pawn on h5 is advanced but blockaded by Black's h7 pawn
3. Black has a dangerous passed pawn on e6
4. Black's bishop controls important squares
5. Black's rook is active on a5
6. White's king is somewhat exposed

Legal moves:
- b2c3 (king moves towards center)
- b2b1 (king retreats)

Let's evaluate both options:

1. b2c3:
Pros:
- Moves king towards center
- Potentially blocks Black's queen checks
Cons:
- Exposes king to more checks (Qa2+)
- Bishop can attack from d4

2. b2b1:
Pros:
- Gets king to safer position
- Avoids immediate checks
Cons:
- Gives up central control
- May allow Black to coordinate pieces better

After deep consideration, b2b1 seems more prudent because:
- It removes the king from potential discovered attacks
- Black's immediate Qa2+ is prevented
- The position remains complex but White avoids immediate dangers
- White can hope to create counterplay with the h-pawn if given time

Black's main threats are pushing the e-pawn or coordinating queen+bishop attacks, so king safety is paramount here.

2025-06-11 22:19:32,691 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:19:38,783 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.09s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a5, bishop on b7, pawn on e6, pawn on h7, knight on g8
- White: King on b1, pawn on h5

**Black to move.**

**Threats and Evaluation:**
- Black is up a huge amount of material (rook, bishop, knight, and pawns vs. just a king and pawn).
- White has a pawn on h5, but it is not dangerous.
- Black's king is safe, and White's king is cut off on the first rank.
- Black can aim for checkmate or force a winning endgame.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **a5a1+**: Immediate check, forces the king to a2 or c2.
2. **a5b5**: Prepares to bring the rook to the b-file, but less direct.
3. **e6e5**: Opens up the bishop, but not urgent.
4. **h7h6**: Prevents h6, but not necessary.
5. **g8f6**: Develops the knight, but not urgent.
6. **b7e4**: Activates the bishop, but not urgent.

**Calculation:**
- **a5a1+**: If 1...Ra1+ 2.Kxa1, then Black can play ...Bd5, ...Ne7, ...Kf7, and win easily. But after 1...Ra1+ 2.Kc2, the king is still cut off.
- **a5b5**: Prepares Rb7, but not as forcing.
- **a5a4**: Not useful.
- **a5a2**: Not as forcing as a5a1+.

**Best Move:**
- **a5a1+** is the most forcing move, driving the king to the edge and preparing to mop up. After 1...Ra1+ 2.Kc2, Black can continue with Be4+ or Ne7, and the win is trivial.

**Final Decision:**
```
a5a1

2025-06-11 22:19:59,962 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.24s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/7P/8/8/8/rK6 w k - 1 89

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black has king + rook)
2. White's pawn on h5 is advanced but blockaded by Black's h7 pawn
3. Black's rook is currently attacking White's king from a1
4. White's king is confined to the first rank
5. Black has a bishop on b7 that's not currently active but could become dangerous

Legal moves: b1c2, b1b2, b1a1

Let's evaluate each option:

1. b1a1:
This would trade kings for rook, leaving us with K+P vs K+B. While this reduces material, the bishop can easily stop the h-pawn by occupying the h1-a8 diagonal. This would likely lead to a draw.

2. b1b2:
This moves away from the rook's attack but leaves the king more exposed. Black could play ...a1a2+ next, forcing our king to move again while improving their rook's position.

3. b1c2:
This seems the most promising. It:
- Gets the king away from the rook's attack
- Potentially prepares to advance the king towards the center
- Keeps options open for future pawn advances or king activity

After b1c2, Black's main options would be:
- ...a1a2+ (but then Kc3 and the rook can't maintain the attack)
- ...b7a6 (trying to activate the bishop, but we can respond with Kd3)
- ...h7h6 (fixing the pawn structure, but our king can become more active)

The position would remain complex but b1c2 gives White the most flexibility and keeps winning chances alive, as the h-pawn might become dangerous if we can activate our king sufficiently.

Therefore, after careful consideration, the best move is:

```
b1c2

2025-06-11 22:20:07,491 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.51s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/7P/8/8/2K5/r7 b k - 2 89

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a1, bishop on b7, knight on g8, pawns on e6, h7
- White: King on c2, pawn on h5

**Assessment:**
- Black is up a rook, bishop, and knight for a pawn. White has only a king and a pawn.
- White's only hope is to push the h-pawn, but Black can easily stop it.
- Black can win by converting the material advantage, but must avoid stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a1a2+**: Rook check, forcing the king to b3 or c3.
2. **a1a4**: Cut off the king.
3. **g8f6**: Develop the knight, bring it closer to the action.
4. **e8f7**: Centralize the king.
5. **b7d5**: Activate the bishop.
6. **h7h6**: Prevent h6 by White.

**Tactical considerations:**
- White's king is on c2, so a check with the rook is strong.
- After a1a2+, if Kb3, then Bd5+ is a strong follow-up.
- If Kc3, then Ra3+ wins the h-pawn or forces the king away.

**Best plan:**
- Use the rook to check and cut off the king.
- Bring the bishop and knight closer.
- Avoid stalemate.

**Calculation:**
1. a1a2+ Kb3 (if Kc3, then Ra3+ Kb2, Ra5 and the king is cut off)
2. ... Bd5 (threatening mate and controlling squares)
3. ... Ne7/Nf6 to bring the knight in.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to check with the rook and drive the king further to the edge.

**Final move:**
```
a1a2
```

2025-06-11 22:20:08,492 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:20:25,824 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.33s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/7P/8/8/r1K5/8 w k - 3 90

Key features:
1. Material: White has king + pawn (h5) vs Black has king + rook + bishop + pawn (h7)
2. White is in check from the rook on a2
3. White's pawn on h5 is advanced but blockaded by Black's h7 pawn
4. Black's pieces are active and coordinated
5. White's king is very restricted

Legal moves to get out of check:
c2d3, c2c3, c2b3, c2d1, c2c1, c2b1

Let's evaluate each:
1. c2d3 - moves towards black's pieces, potentially into more trouble
2. c2c3 - stays in the rook's line, but might be okay temporarily
3. c2b3 - moves towards the a2 rook, which seems dangerous
4. c2d1 - moves towards the corner, but away from threats
5. c2c1 - stays in the rook's line but in the corner
6. c2b1 - moves into the corner, but might be safest

The best option appears to be c2b1 because:
- It moves the king to the corner where it has some protection from checks
- It's as far as possible from Black's active pieces
- Other moves either stay in the rook's line or move towards Black's pieces
- While the position is lost for White, this move prolongs resistance the most

Black will likely continue with Ra1+ next move, but this is the most resilient option.

2025-06-11 22:20:26,337 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:20:35,617 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.28s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), rook (a2), bishop (b7), pawns (e6, h7), knight (g8)
- White: King (b1), rook (a1), pawn (h5)

**Position:**
- Black is up a bishop and a pawn, and has a very active rook on a2.
- White's rook is on a1, king on b1, pawn on h5.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- Black's rook on a2 is cutting off the white king.
- White's pawn on h5 is not dangerous yet.
- Black's king is safe on e8, and Black has a knight on g8 that can be developed.

**Immediate threats:**
- White has no immediate threats.
- Black can consider moves like Ra8, Ra3, Ra4, Ra5, Ra6, Ra7, Ra8, or even just developing the knight.
- Black can also consider pushing the e-pawn to e5 to open up the bishop and create a passed pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Ra8: Defends the back rank, but not necessary.
2. Ra3: Invades the third rank, but doesn't threaten much.
3. Ra4: Invades the fourth rank, but doesn't threaten much.
4. Ra5: Similar.
5. Ra6: Similar.
6. Ra7: Similar.
7. Ra8: Similar.
8. Ra2: Stay on a2.
9. h6: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't do much.
10. e5: Pushes the pawn, but White can just wait.
11. Develop the knight: Nf6, Nh6, Ne7.

**Best plan:**
- Black's plan should be to activate the rook, possibly invade along the second rank, and use the bishop to dominate the board.
- The move Ra2-a5 is attractive, as it can swing to the h-file to attack the h5 pawn, or to b5 to cut off the king further.
- Alternatively, Ra2-a4 or Ra2-a3 are also good.
- Another plan is to bring the knight into play, but the rook is more active.

**Tactics:**
- Ra5 threatens to swing to h5 and win the pawn.
- White can't defend the pawn on h5 with the rook, as the king is cut off.

**Conclusion:**
- The move Ra5 is strong, threatening to win the h5 pawn and further restrict White.

**Final move:**
```
a2a5

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r6P/8/8/8/1K6 w k - 5 91

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White: King + pawn vs Black: King + rook + pawn)
2. White's h-pawn is advanced to h5, potentially threatening to promote
3. Black's rook is on a5, controlling the a-file
4. Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed
5. Black has a pawn on e6 and h7
6. White's king is on b1, somewhat restricted

Legal moves: b1c2, b1b2, b1c1, h5h6

Let's evaluate each option:

1. h5h6:
   - Advances the pawn closer to promotion
   - But allows Black to play ...h7h6, blocking the pawn
   - After ...h7h6, the pawn is permanently blocked
   - Not a promising path

2. b1c1:
   - Moves the king towards the center
   - But doesn't create any immediate threats
   - Black can improve their position with ...Ra5-a1+ forcing White's king back

3. b1b2:
   - Moves the king towards the center
   - Still allows ...Ra5-a2+ forcing the king back
   - Doesn't create counterplay

4. b1c2:
   - Best option in my view
   - Moves the king towards the center
   - Prepares to potentially move to d3 later
   - If Black plays ...Ra5-a2+, we can go Kc2-b3
   - Creates some potential for counterplay against Black's e6 pawn

The best move is to centralize the king while maintaining some flexibility. While the position is objectively lost for White due to Black's material advantage, b1c2 gives the most practical chances to create complications.

2025-06-11 22:21:03,262 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.28s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/r6P/8/8/2K5/8 b k - 6 91  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Rook (a5), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), Pawn (h7), Pawn (e6)
- White: King (c2), Pawn (h5)

**Key points:**
- Black is up a full rook, bishop, and knight for a pawn.
- White has only a king and a pawn on h5.
- Black's king is safe, and White's king is far from the action.
- Black's rook on a5 is active and can cut off the White king.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- Black's knight on g8 is not yet active but can be developed.
- Black's h7 pawn is not under threat.
- White's only hope is to push the h-pawn, but Black can easily stop it.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a5a2+**: Rook check, driving the White king away from the h-pawn.
2. **a5a4**: Rook swing, but less forcing.
3. **g8f6**: Develop the knight, but not urgent.
4. **h7h6**: Prevent h6, but not necessary yet.
5. **e6e5**: Open up the bishop, but not urgent.
6. **b7e4+**: Bishop check, but king can go to c3.

**Calculation:**

- **a5a2+**: If Kb3, then Bd5+ wins the h5 pawn or forces the king away. If Kc1, then Ra1+ and Ra2+ can harass the king.
- **g8f6**: Develops, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
- **h7h6**: If h6, then Nxh6, but White can't push yet.

**Best plan:**  
- Use the rook to cut off the king and then mop up the h5 pawn.
- The move **a5a2+** is very strong: it forces the king to b3 or c3, after which Bd5+ is devastating.

**Let's check:**
1. a5a2+ Kb3 (forced)
2. Bd5 (threatening Ra3# and attacking h5)
   - If Kc3, then Ra3+ Kd4 Ra4+ and the king is driven away.
   - If Kb4, then Rb2+ and the king is driven further away.

**Conclusion:**  
**a5a2+** is the most forcing and effective move, pressing the advantage and leading to a swift win.

My move is:
```
a5a2
```

2025-06-11 22:21:23,355 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 19.38s):
Let me analyze this position carefully. The FEN is: `4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/7P/8/8/r1K5/8 w k - 7 92`

Key features of the position:
1. Material: White has a king and pawn (h5). Black has king, bishop, pawn (h7), and rook on a2.
2. King safety: White's king is exposed on c2. Black's king is somewhat exposed on e8.
3. Passed pawns: White's h-pawn is advanced but blockaded. Black has no passed pawns.
4. Immediate threats: Black's rook on a2 is attacking White's pawn on h5 indirectly (if White moves the king, Ra2xh2 is possible).

Looking at the legal moves:
1. c2d3 - Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks from the bishop
2. c2c3 - Keeps king near the pawn but doesn't improve position
3. c2b3 - Moves king towards a-file, potentially threatening to approach the rook
4. c2d1 - Retreats king to first rank, passive
5. c2c1 - Similar to d1, passive
6. c2b1 - Most active, heading towards the rook

Best plan:
- White must try to activate the king to either support the h-pawn or attack Black's pieces
- Black's bishop is limited by the pawn structure
- The rook on a2 is currently passive but could become active

After careful consideration, `c2b3` is the most active move:
- Prepares to approach the rook (Kb3-a3)
- Potentially threatens to capture the h7 pawn via Kb3-c4-d5-e6-f7
- Keeps options open to return to c2 if needed
- Limits Black's active possibilities

The alternatives are either too passive or expose the king unnecessarily. While the position is likely drawn with best play, we must keep maximum activity.

2025-06-11 22:21:29,630 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.29s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a2, bishop on b7, pawns on e6, h7, knight on g8
- White: King on b3, pawn on h5

**Material:** Black is up a rook, bishop, and pawn for a knight (which is off the board), so Black is completely winning.

**Threats:**
- White has no immediate threats. The only pawn is on h5, which is not dangerous.
- Black can try to checkmate the White king or win more material.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Ra3+**: This checks the White king, forcing it to move. After Kxa3, Black can play Bd5, threatening mate on a2.
2. **Bd5+**: This checks the king, but White can play Kb4, and there is no immediate mate.
3. **Ra1**: This is not a check, but keeps the rook active.
4. **Bd5**: Prepares to bring the bishop to a2 for mate, but not immediate.
5. **e5**: Not urgent, doesn't help with the attack.
6. **h6**: Not urgent.
7. **Ne7, Nh6, Nf6**: Knight moves don't help immediately.

**Deep Calculation:**
- After **Ra3+**, if White plays Kxa3, then **Bd5** threatens mate on a2. White cannot stop Ra2#.
- If White does not take the rook, then the king is forced to a4 or c4, but both squares allow Bd5+ and then Ra2#.

**Let's check the line:**
1. Ra3+ Kxa3
2. Bd5 (threatening Ra2#)
   - White cannot stop Ra2# (the king is boxed in by its own pawn and Black's bishop).

Therefore, **Ra3+** is a forced mate in a few moves.

**Final Move:**
```
a2a3
```

2025-06-11 22:21:45,983 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.44s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/7P/8/rK6/8/8 w k - 9 93

Key features:
1. Material: White has king + pawn vs Black's king + bishop + pawn + rook
2. Black has a significant material advantage (rook and bishop vs pawn)
3. White's pawn on h5 is advanced but blockaded by Black's h7 pawn
4. Black's rook is currently attacking White's king from a3
5. White's king is on b3, which is somewhat exposed

Legal moves: b3c4, b3b4, b3a3, b3c2, b3b2

Let's evaluate each option:

1. b3a3 - Captures the rook but loses to Kxa3 followed by B moves picking up the h5 pawn
2. b3b4 - Moves away from the rook but allows Black to play Ra4 pinning the king to the pawn
3. b3c4 - Similar to b4 but less vulnerable to Ra4+ ideas
4. b3c2 - Goes backward but might allow Black to activate pieces more
5. b3b2 - Similar to c2 but even more passive

The best practical chance is b3c4:
- It moves the king away from immediate threats
- It doesn't allow immediate Ra4+ pin
- It keeps some coordination between king and pawn
- It's the most active option available

While the position is objectively lost for White due to Black's material advantage, b3c4 offers the most resistance by keeping the king active and not immediately falling into any tactical traps.

2025-06-11 22:21:53,422 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.56s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on a3, bishop on b7, knight on g8, pawns on e6, h7, h5
- White: King on c4, rook gone, no pawns, no minor pieces

**Position:**
- Black is up a rook, bishop, knight, and two pawns vs just a lone king.
- White's king is on c4, relatively central but with no support.
- Black's king is on e8, safe.
- Black's rook is on a3, ready to swing.
- Black's bishop on b7 covers the long diagonal.
- Black's knight on g8 is not yet developed.
- Black's pawns: e6 (central), h7 (back rank).

**Immediate threats:**
- White has no threats.
- Black can coordinate pieces to force mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Ra4+**: Check, forces White's king to b3 or c5.
2. **Ra1**: Not a check, but lines up for lateral checks.
3. **Ba6+**: Bishop check, but king can go to c5 or b3.
4. **Ne7**: Develops knight, but not urgent.
5. **e5**: Opens bishop, but not forcing.
6. **h6**: Not urgent.

**Best plan:** 
- Use rook and bishop to restrict the king, force it to the edge, then bring in the knight or king for mate.
- Immediate checks are good to force the king to the edge.

**Calculate Ra4+:**
- 1...Ra4+ 2.Kb3 (if Kc5, then Rc4+ wins)
- After Kb3, Black can play Bd5+ or Bd5, or even Rg4 to cut off escape.

**Calculate Ba6+:**
- 1...Ba6+ 2.Kc5 (if Kb3, then Ra4+ is strong)
- After Kc5, Black can play Rc3+ and force the king further.

**Calculate Ra1:**
- Not forcing.

**Conclusion:**
- **Ra4+** is the most forcing move, driving the king to the edge and starting the mating net.

**Final move:**
```
a3a4+

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/7P/r1K5/8/8/8 w k - 11 94

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + bishop + pawn)
2. White's king is on c4, Black's king is on e8
3. White has a passed h-pawn on h5
4. Black has a bishop on b7 and a pawn on e6
5. Black's rook is on a4, attacking White's pawn on h5 indirectly (if White moves king, Ra4xh5)

Legal moves: c4c5, c4b5, c4d3, c4c3, c4b3

Let's evaluate each option:

1. c4c5:
   - Advances king towards promotion square of h-pawn
   - But allows Black to play Bc6 attacking the h-pawn
   - After Kc5 Bc6, White must defend the pawn with Kd4 or Kb4, but both allow Black counterplay

2. c4b5:
   - Moves towards queenside but away from the h-pawn
   - Allows Black to play Bc6 with tempo
   - Not ideal as it doesn't help promote the pawn

3. c4d3:
   - Retreats the king but keeps it near the h-pawn
   - Allows Black to play Ra4xh5 immediately
   - This would lead to a lost position as White can't stop both the bishop and pawn

4. c4c3:
   - Similar to c4d3 but slightly better
   - Still allows Ra4xh5 with similar problems

5. c4b3:
   - Best move in my opinion
   - Protects against Ra4xh5 (if Rxh5, Kxa4 and White has king vs bishop + pawn)
   - Prepares to bring king back towards the h-pawn via c4-d5-e5 etc
   - Black's best reply would be Bc6, but then Kc4 keeps the position balanced

The key is to keep the h-pawn protected while making progress towards its promotion. c4b3 achieves this by preventing the immediate rook capture while keeping the king active.

After c4b3 Bc6, we can play Kc4 maintaining the position. Black has no way to make progress while White can slowly advance the h-pawn.

2025-06-11 22:22:33,135 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 10.07s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k1nr/1b5p/4p3/7P/r7/1K6/8/8 b k - 12 94

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Rook (a4), Bishop (b7), Knight (g8), Pawn (h7), Pawn (e6)
- White: King (b3), Pawn (h5)

**Assessment:**
- Black is up a bishop and a rook for a pawn.
- White's king is on b3, far from the action.
- White's only pawn is on h5, which could become dangerous if not watched.
- Black's king is safe on e8.
- Black's rook is very active on a4, cutting off the b-file and controlling the 4th rank.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- Black's knight is on g8, not yet developed but can join the game.
- Black's pawn on e6 is solid, h7 is safe for now.

**Immediate threats:**
- White has no immediate threats. The h-pawn is not yet dangerous.
- Black can consider activating the rook, bishop, and knight, and pushing for checkmate or winning more material.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a4-a8**: Rook lift, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
2. **g8-e7**: Develop the knight, possibly to f5 or d5.
3. **g8-h6**: Knight to the rim, but not threatening.
4. **g8-f6**: Knight to f6, eyeing h5 and e4.
5. **e6-e5**: Opens up the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
6. **h7-h6**: Prevents h6 by White, but not urgent.
7. **b7-c8**: Retreats the bishop, not needed.
8. **a4-h4**: Rook swing to attack h5, but White can push h6.

**Key ideas:**
- White's only hope is to push the h-pawn. If Black can blockade or capture it, the game is easily won.
- Black should activate the knight, possibly to f6 to attack h5.
- Black can also consider bringing the king closer, but activating the knight is more urgent.

**Calculate g8-f6:**
- 1... Nf6
- If 2. h6, then 2... Kf7 (or 2... Ng4, threatening Nxh6)
- If 2. h5-h6, then 2... Ng4 (attacking h6), and if 3. h7, then 3... Nxh6, pawn is stopped.

**Calculate g8-e7:**
- 1... Ne7
- Knight can go to f5 or d5, but f6 is more direct.

**Calculate a4-h4:**
- 1... Rh4 2. h6 Rxh6 3. Kc4 (White king tries to approach) Rh4+ 4. Kc5 (or Kd3) and Black is still winning, but White's king is getting closer.

**Calculate h7-h6:**
- 1... h6 2. Kc4 (White king approaches) and Black still has time.

**Best move:**
- **g8-f6** is the most direct, activating the knight and stopping the h-pawn.

**Final move:**
```
g8f6
```

Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current position:
- White king on b3, pawn on h5
- Black king on f6, rook on a4, pawn on h7
- It's White's move

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (king + pawn vs king + rook)
2. Black's rook is active and controlling files
3. White's pawn is advanced but potentially blockable
4. Black's king is closer to the h-pawn than White's king

Candidate moves:
1. b3a4 - trades kings but leaves us in a lost pawn endgame
2. b3c3 - centralizes king but doesn't address rook pressure
3. b3c2 - moves toward pawn but allows rook checks
4. b3b2 - stays near pawn but limits king mobility
5. h5h6 - advances pawn, creating immediate threat

Deep analysis:
- h5h6 creates a passed pawn that must be stopped
- Black would likely respond with ...h7h6, but then we can bring our king toward the pawn
- Other king moves don't create any threats and allow Black to improve position
- The pawn advance is our only active plan

After h5h6 h7h6:
- White king can march toward the h-file
- Black must keep king near to stop promotion
- Rook alone cannot stop the pawn if king supports it
- This gives us drawing chances

Other moves lead to passive positions where Black can slowly improve. The pawn push is our best practical chance.

2025-06-11 22:22:56,536 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.43s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k2r/1b5p/4pn1P/8/r7/1K6/8/8 b k - 0 95  
**Black to move**

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Rook (a4), Bishop (b7), Knight (f6), Pawn (h7)
- White: King (b3), Pawn (h6)

**Key features:**
- White's pawn on h6 is advanced and could promote if not stopped.
- Black's king is relatively safe.
- Black has a huge material advantage (rook, bishop, knight vs. lone pawn).
- White's king is far from the action and cannot support the h-pawn.
- Black's rook is very active on a4.
- Black's knight on f6 and bishop on b7 are well placed to control promotion squares.

**Immediate threats:**
- White's only threat is to push h7-h8=Q, but Black can easily stop this.
- Black can try to win the h6 pawn or blockade it.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rook moves:** a4-a8, a4-a7, a4-a6, a4-a5, a4-h4, a4-g4, a4-f4, a4-e4, a4-d4, a4-c4, a4-b4, a4-a3, a4-a2, a4-a1
2. **King moves:** e8-f8, e8-d8, e8-f7, e8-e7, e8-d7, e8-g8 (kingside castle)
3. **Bishop moves:** b7-c8, b7-a8, b7-c6, b7-a6, b7-d5, b7-e4, b7-f3, b7-g2, b7-h1
4. **Knight moves:** f6-g8, f6-d7, f6-h5, f6-d5, f6-g4, f6-e4
5. **Pawn move:** e6-e5

**Analysis:**

- **Rook to h4**: Immediately attacks the h6 pawn. If White pushes h7, Black can play Rxh6 and the pawn is gone.
- **Rook to a8**: Passive, doesn't address the h-pawn.
- **Bishop to e4**: Attacks the h7 square, but doesn't immediately threaten the pawn.
- **Knight to g8**: Blocks the rook from h8, not ideal.
- **King moves**: Not urgent, as the king is not in danger.
- **e6-e5**: Not relevant, as it doesn't affect the h-pawn.

**Best move:**
- **Rook a4-h4** is the most direct and effective. It attacks the h6 pawn, and if White pushes h7, Black simply plays Rxh6 and wins the pawn. After that, Black can easily convert the material advantage.

**Final move:**
```
a4h4

2025-06-11 22:23:14,187 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.07s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

Current FEN: 4k2r/1b5p/4pn1P/8/7r/1K6/8/8 w k - 1 96

Key features:
1. Material is equal (White has K+pawn vs Black's K+R+B)
2. White's king is exposed but Black's pieces are not coordinated for immediate mate
3. White's h6 pawn is advanced and potentially dangerous
4. Black has a rook on h4 attacking White's pawn
5. Black's bishop on b7 is somewhat passive

Looking at the legal moves:
1. b3c3 - moves king towards center but exposes to checks
2. b3a3 - moves king away from danger but towards edge
3. b3c2 - moves king towards safety but still exposed
4. b3b2 - keeps king near pawn but still vulnerable
5. b3a2 - moves king to corner which is dangerous

Best option appears to be b3a3:
- Gets king away from immediate danger
- Prepares to bring king towards the h6 pawn which is our winning chance
- Avoids potential checks from Black's rook
- If Black takes pawn with Rxh6, we have Ka4 threatening to support our pawn's advance

Other moves either leave king too exposed or don't make progress. The h6 pawn is our only winning resource, so we must protect our king while preparing to support it.

After b3a3, if Black doesn't take the pawn, we can consider Ka4 next move to support the pawn's advance to h7.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k2r/1b5p/4pn1P/8/7r/K7/8/8 b k - 2 96

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Rook (h4), Bishop (b7), Knight (f6), Pawn (h7)
- White: King (a3), Pawn (h6)

**White's king is on a3, cut off from the rest of the board. White's only pawn is h6, which is advanced but blockaded. Black has a huge material advantage and total control.**

**Immediate threats:**
- White's pawn is not threatening to promote immediately.
- Black can try to checkmate the White king, which is boxed in on the queenside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h4h3**: Push the rook to h3, threatening ...Rxh6, winning the last pawn.
2. **h4h5**: Keep the rook on the h-file, but this doesn't threaten anything new.
3. **h4g4**: Swing the rook to the g-file, but no immediate threat.
4. **f6g8**: Move the knight, but no immediate threat.
5. **e8f7**: Activate the king, but not urgent.
6. **e6e5**: Open up the bishop, but not urgent.
7. **h4a4**: Rook swing to a4, threatening Ra8# ideas, but the king can escape to b3.

**Best plan:** Black should win the h6 pawn and then use the extra material to force mate. The move **h4h3** threatens Rxh6, and if White pushes h7, then Rxh7 wins the pawn. After that, Black can bring the king and pieces to force mate.

**Is there any danger?** No, White has no counterplay.

**Final move:**
```
h4h3

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k2r/1b5p/4pn1P/8/8/K6r/8/8 w k - 3 97

Key features of the position:
1. White has a king on a3 and a pawn on h6
2. Black has king on e8, rook on h3, bishop on b7, pawn on h7, knight on f6, and rook on h8
3. White is to move
4. Black has castling rights still (k-side)

White's legal moves are only king moves: a3b4, a3a4, a3b2, a3a2

Let's evaluate each option:

1. a3b4:
- Moves king towards center but exposes it to potential checks from black's rook on h3
- Doesn't immediately threaten anything
- Black could play ...Rh3xb4 winning the pawn

2. a3a4:
- Similar to b4 but less exposed to rook attacks
- Still doesn't create any threats
- Black could continue developing with ...Bc8 or ...Ng4

3. a3b2:
- Moves king towards black's pieces which seems dangerous
- Could be met with ...Rh3xb2 winning the pawn
- Not an improvement

4. a3a2:
- Moves king back towards corner
- Potentially safer as it's harder for black to attack
- Keeps options to move to b1 if needed
- Doesn't immediately lose material

The position is extremely difficult for white - black has a significant material advantage (rook, bishop, knight vs just king and pawn). The best practical chance is to try to hold the position by keeping the king safe and hoping black makes a mistake.

a3a2 seems the most resilient move as it:
- Keeps the king relatively safe in the corner
- Doesn't expose it to immediate attacks
- Maintains the h6 pawn which is white's only hope

The other moves either expose the king or lose material immediately. While the position is likely lost, a3a2 offers the best practical chances.

2025-06-11 22:23:42,096 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:23:47,145 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.05s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on e8, rook on h8, bishop on b7, knight on f6, pawn on h3, pawn on e6  
- White: King on a2, pawn on h6

**Black to move.**

**Threats and evaluation:**
- Black is up a lot of material (rook, bishop, knight, pawns vs. lone king and pawn).
- White's only hope is the h6 pawn, but it is blockaded by Black's h3 pawn.
- Black's king is safe, and White's king is far away from the action.
- Black can win easily by pushing the h-pawn or bringing pieces closer for mate.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h3-h2**: Pushes the pawn, threatening to promote. White cannot stop it.
2. **h8-g8**: Bring the rook to the open file, but not necessary.
3. **f6-g8**: Move the knight, but not needed.
4. **e6-e5**: Open up the bishop, but not urgent.
5. **Other rook or king moves**: Not needed.

**Calculation:**
- After **h3-h2**, White cannot stop h1=Q next move.  
- If White tries to approach with the king, it's too far away.  
- If White pushes h7, Black can ignore and promote first.

**Conclusion:**  
The fastest way to win is to push the h-pawn.

**Final move:**
```
h3h2

2025-06-11 22:24:06,473 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.87s):
Let me analyze this critical position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k2r/1b5p/4pn1P/8/8/8/K6r/8 w k - 5 98

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + rook + bishop + pawn)
2. White's king is on a2, Black's king is on e8
3. White has a passed h-pawn on h6
4. Black has a rook on h2 and bishop on b7
5. Black has castling rights still available (k-side)

Legal moves: a2b3, a2a3, a2b1, a2a1

Let's evaluate each option:

1. a2a1:
- Moves the king away from potential checks
- But puts the king in a very passive position
- Black can continue developing threats

2. a2b1:
- Similar to a1 but slightly more active
- Still quite passive
- Doesn't address any immediate threats

3. a2a3:
- Moves the king towards the center
- But exposes it to potential checks from the bishop
- Doesn't make progress with the h-pawn

4. a2b3:
- Most active move
- Prepares to potentially advance the king to support the h-pawn
- Puts the king on a safer square than a2
- Limits Black's bishop's scope
- Prepares potential future checks if the king can reach c4

The best move is a2b3 because:
- It's the most active king move
- It prepares to support the h-pawn's promotion
- It limits Black's options
- It avoids potential future checks from the bishop
- It maintains flexibility for the king to move forward

Black's main threats are:
- Rh2-h1 mate if given the chance
- Bishop checks
But none are immediately dangerous after Kb3

2025-06-11 22:24:13,588 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.67s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Position Recap:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on h8, bishop on b7, knight on f6, pawn on h2, pawn on e6.
- White: King on b3, pawn on h6.

**Material:**
- Black is up a full rook and bishop for a pawn.
- White's only hope is the h6 pawn, but Black's pieces are well placed.

**Threats:**
- White's pawn on h6 is two squares from queening, but Black's rook on h8 controls h6.
- White's king is far from the action and cannot support the pawn.
- Black can try to win the h6 pawn or set up a mating net.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **h8g8**: Rook to g8, preparing to attack the h6 pawn from the side.
2. **h2h6**: Pawn to h6, but this is not possible since the pawn is already on h2.
3. **h2h6**: Not legal.
4. **h2h5/h4/h3**: Advancing the h-pawn, but not urgent.
5. **e6e5**: Opens up the bishop, but not urgent.
6. **f6g8**: Retreats the knight, but not necessary.
7. **h2h1**: Promotes pawn, but not possible since pawn is on h2.
8. **h2h1**: Not legal.
9. **h2g2**: Pawn captures, but not possible.
10. **h2h6**: Not legal.

**Best Plan:**
- The most pressing plan is to win the h6 pawn and then use the material advantage to checkmate.
- The move **h8g8** attacks the h6 pawn directly. White cannot defend it, and after Rxh6, Black will have a decisive material advantage and no counterplay to worry about.

**Check for Tactics:**
- Is there any immediate mate or tactic? No, White's king is too far.
- Is there any stalemate risk? No, White has plenty of moves.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play **h8g8**, attacking the h6 pawn and preparing to win it next move.

**Final Move:**
```
h8g8
```

2025-06-11 22:24:32,054 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.06s):
Let me analyze this position carefully. The FEN is: `4k1r1/1b5p/4pn1P/8/8/1K6/7r/8 w - - 7 99`

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black has king + rook + bishop + pawn)
2. White's pawn on h6 is advanced but blockaded by Black's pawn on h7
3. Black's rook on h2 is very active and threatening
4. Black's bishop on b7 is controlling important squares
5. White's king is somewhat exposed on b3

Legal moves are king moves: b3c4, b3b4, b3a4, b3c3, b3a3

Let's evaluate each:
1. b3c4 - moves towards center but exposes king to checks from rook
2. b3b4 - moves away from rook's control but towards bishop's diagonal
3. b3a4 - moves away from both rook and bishop control
4. b3c3 - stays near current position but still in rook's line
5. b3a3 - moves away from rook but towards corner

The best move appears to be b3a4 because:
- It moves the king away from the rook's attack (h2 rook controls b2)
- It moves away from the bishop's diagonal (b7 bishop controls c6, d5, e4, f3, g2)
- It keeps options open to move towards the h-pawn if possible
- It doesn't run towards the corner like a3 would
- It maintains some flexibility in the position

Other moves either leave the king exposed or move it towards danger. The a4 square is relatively safe as it's not controlled by any black pieces currently.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, rook on g8, bishop on b7, knight on f6, pawn on e6, rook on h2, pawn on h6
- White: King on a4, pawn on h6

**White's threats:**
- White has a pawn on h6, but it is blockaded by Black's rook on h2.
- White's king is far from the action and cannot help the h-pawn.
- White has no other pieces.

**Black's threats:**
- Black is up a rook, bishop, and knight for a pawn.
- Black's pieces are active and can coordinate for mate or to win the h6-pawn.
- Black can try to deliver mate or win the h6-pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. ...Rg4: Attack the a4 king, but White can just move away.
2. ...Rg6: Prepare to double on the g-file or swing the rook to h6.
3. ...Rh4: Attack the a4 king, but again, White can just move.
4. ...Rg1: Try to swing the rook to a1 to cut off the king.
5. ...Rh1: Prepare to swing the rook to a1.
6. ...Ke7: Centralize the king.
7. ...Nd5: Bring the knight closer to the action.
8. ...e5: Open up the bishop and threaten e4.

**Critical lines:**
- The h6 pawn is blockaded and not a threat.
- The White king is cut off on the a-file and cannot help.
- Black can try to bring the rook to the a-file to cut off the king and then use the other rook to deliver mate.

**Best plan:**
- Bring the rook to the a-file to cut off the king, then use the other rook and bishop/knight to deliver mate.

**Best move:**
- ...Rg1 is strong, threatening ...Ra1+ and cutting off the king.

**Check for tactics:**
- After ...Rg1, if White plays h7, then ...Rh1 wins the pawn.
- If White does nothing, ...Ra1+ is coming.

**Final move:**

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k3/1b5p/4pn1P/8/K7/8/7r/6r1 w - - 9 100

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black has king + bishop + pawn + 2 rooks)
2. White's pawn on h6 is advanced but blockaded by Black's pawn on h7
3. Black has two rooks on the g and h files
4. White's king is exposed and Black has threats of checks
5. Black's bishop on b7 controls important squares

Looking at the legal moves for White's king (a4):
- a4b5: moves towards center but into bishop's control
- a4a5: advances but doesn't improve position
- a4b4: moves towards center but still exposed
- a4b3: moves towards center and away from rook's file
- a4a3: retreats but stays on a-file where rooks can check

The best move appears to be a4b3 because:
1. It moves the king towards the center
2. It gets away from the a-file where Black's rooks can give checks
3. It's not controlled by Black's bishop
4. It maintains some flexibility for future moves

Other options either move into bishop's control or don't improve the king's safety. While the position is difficult, a4b3 gives White the best chance to resist.

2025-06-11 22:25:00,132 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, bishop on b7, knight on f6, pawn on e6, rook on h2 and g1.
- White: King on b3, pawn on h6.

**White's king is exposed on b3, and Black has overwhelming material (two rooks, bishop, knight, and pawn vs. just a pawn for White). Black's rooks are very active, and White has no counterplay.**

**Immediate threats and tactics:**
- Black can checkmate White quickly if the king is forced to the edge.
- The h6 pawn is not dangerous; Black can ignore it for now.
- Rook on h2 can swing to h3 or h1 to cut off the king.
- Rook on g1 can swing to g3, g2, or g4.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rh3+**: Forces the king to a4, after which Rg4+ is mate.
2. **Rg3+**: Forces the king to a4, then Rh4 is mate.
3. **Rh1**: Threatens mate on a1, but White can escape to a4.
4. **Other rook moves**: None seem to threaten immediate mate.

Let's check **1. Rh3+**:
- 1...Rh3+ 2. Ka4 Rg4# (Checkmate)

Let's check **1. Rg3+**:
- 1...Rg3+ 2. Ka4 Rh4# (Checkmate)

Both moves lead to forced mate in one after the check.

**Conclusion:** Both 1...Rh3+ and 1...Rg3+ are mate in two. Let's pick the first one in the list.

2025-06-11 22:25:21,200 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.79s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.

The current board position is:
- White: King on b3, pawn on h6
- Black: King on e8, rook on g1, rook on h3, bishop on b7, pawn on f6

Key observations:
1. Material is roughly equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king, 2 rooks, bishop)
2. White's pawn on h6 is advanced but blockaded by Black's rook on h3
3. Black has two active rooks and a bishop, while White's king is somewhat exposed
4. Black's king is safely tucked away on e8
5. White is in a very difficult defensive position

Looking at the legal moves for White's king:
- b3c4: moves towards center but exposes to checks
- b3b4: moves away from rooks but towards bishop's diagonal
- b3a4: moves towards a corner (dangerous)
- b3c2: moves down but into potential rook attacks
- b3b2: stays on b-file but may be vulnerable
- b3a2: moves towards corner but away from immediate threats

The best defensive move appears to be b3a2, keeping the king as far as possible from Black's rooks while not walking into any immediate discovered checks or forks. This also keeps the king near the h6 pawn in case there's any chance to promote it later.

Other moves:
- b3c4 would allow ...Rc1+ winning the pawn
- b3b4 walks into the bishop's diagonal (Bb7-c8 would attack the king)
- b3a4 is too close to the corner and could be mated
- b3c2/b2 both allow immediate rook checks

After b3a2, Black will likely play ...Rg3 trying to coordinate the rooks, but it's the most resilient move in this difficult position.

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-11 22:25:21,441 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:25:27,438 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.00s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Bishop (b7), Knight (f6), Pawn (h6), Rook (h3), Rook (g1)
- White: King (a2), Pawn (h6)

**White's king is on a2, completely cut off from the action. White's only pawn is h6, which is blockaded and easily controlled. Black has overwhelming material and total domination.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can checkmate with the rooks and bishop.
- White has no counterplay at all.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rh1**: Rook to h1 threatens mate on a1.
2. **Rg2+**: Rook to g2+ forces the king to a3, then Rh1 is mate.
3. **Rh2**: Rook to h2, preparing Rh1.
4. **Bishop moves**: Not necessary, as the bishop already controls the a8-h1 diagonal.

**Calculation:**
- 1...Rg2+ 2. Ka3 Rh1 (mate next move, as White has no moves to prevent Rh2#)
- 1...Rh1 2. Ka3 Ra1# (if the rook was on a-file, but it's not)
- 1...Rh2, then Rh1, but that's slower.

But the fastest is:
- 1...Rg2+ 2. Ka3 (forced) Rh1 (threatening mate on a1, and White cannot stop it).

But let's check if there's a forced mate in one:
- 1...Rh1 does not immediately mate, as the king is on a2, not a1.
- 1...Rg2+ forces the king to a3, then Rh1 is mate.

**Conclusion:** The best move is
```
g1g2
```
This forces mate next move.

2025-06-11 22:25:47,145 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 19.48s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k3/1b5p/4pn1P/8/8/7r/K5r1/8 w - - 13 102

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn, Black has king + bishop + pawn)
2. White's pawn on h6 is very advanced but blockaded by Black's pawn on h7
3. Black has two connected passed pawns (h7 and f6)
4. White's king is exposed to checks from Black's rooks
5. Black has two rooks coordinating against White's king
6. White's king is on a2, which is very vulnerable

Legal moves are a2b1 or a2a1. Let's evaluate both:

1. a2b1:
- Moves the king towards the center but still leaves it exposed
- Black can continue harassing with rook checks
- Doesn't improve White's pawn promotion chances
- Black can play ...Rb2+ next, forcing the king back

2. a2a1:
- Keeps the king in the corner but removes it from immediate danger
- Black has no immediate checks
- The h6 pawn is still blockaded
- May lead to a repetition if Black can't make progress

Looking at the move history, we've seen several repetitions already. The position appears to be heading toward a draw by repetition or stalemate.

The best practical chance is a2a1, as it removes the king from immediate danger and forces Black to find a way to make progress. Black's rooks are very active, but with accurate defense, White can hold the draw.

2025-06-11 22:25:54,144 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.78s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, Bishop on b7, Knight on f6, Pawns on e6 and h6, Rooks on h3 and g2, Queenless.
- White: King on a1, Pawn on h6, no other pieces.

**Position:**
- White's king is trapped on a1, with no escape squares.
- Black has overwhelming material and total control.
- Black's rook on h3 can deliver mate if the pawn on h6 is captured.
- Black's rook on g2 can swing to the a-file or b-file if needed.
- Black's knight and bishop are not immediately participating in the mate, but can help if needed.
- White's only pawn is on h6, which is protected by the king.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can play Rxh6, but that would be illegal since the pawn is protected by the king.
- Black can try to bring the rook to the a-file to deliver mate, but the pawn on h6 blocks the h-file.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Rg1+ (g2g1): Forces the king to b2, but then the king can move back to a1.
2. Rxh6 (h3h6): Illegal, as the pawn is protected by the king.
3. Kf7, Kd7, Kf8, etc.: King moves do not help.
4. e5: Pawn move does not help.
5. N moves: Knight can try to get to g8 to threaten mate, but not immediate.
6. Rook moves: Rg3, Rg4, etc., do not help.
7. Rook to a3: h3a3, threatens mate on a2, but White can only move the king.

But let's check if there is a forced mate.

**Key idea:** If Black plays Rg1+, White must play Kb2 (the only move). Then, Black can play Rg2+, forcing Ka1, and then Rh1 is mate.

Let's check:
1. ... Rg1+ (g2g1)
2. Ka2 (only move)
3. Rg2+ (g1g2)
4. Ka1 (only move)
5. Rh1# (h3h1)

But wait, after 1...Rg1+, White's only legal move is Ka2. Then Rg2+ forces Ka1, and then Rh1 is mate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g2g1

Let me analyze this critical position thoroughly.

Current FEN: 4k3/1b5p/4pn1P/8/8/7r/8/K5r1 w - - 15 103

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king + pawn vs Black's king + rook + bishop + pawn)
2. White's king is very exposed and under attack
3. Black has multiple threats including ...Rh1#
4. White's h-pawn is advanced but blockaded by the f6 pawn
5. Black's pieces are very active and coordinated

Legal moves are only a1b2 or a1a2. Let's examine both:

1. a1b2:
- Gets the king slightly away from immediate threats
- But allows Rh1 with discovered checks from the bishop on b7
- After Kb2 Rh1, White is in serious trouble as Black can bring the bishop into the attack

2. a1a2:
- Moves towards the corner which is often dangerous
- But in this case, it prevents Rh1# immediately
- Black can still play Rh2 threatening mate
- However, after Ka2 Rh2+, White has Ka1 maintaining the position

The key difference is that a1a2 prevents immediate mate threats while a1b2 allows more dangerous discovered checks. The corner is actually safer here because it limits Black's attacking options.

After a1a2 Rh2, White can go back to a1 and Black can't make progress without allowing the h-pawn to advance. This seems like the only way to hold the position.

Black has winning chances, but a1a2 gives White the best defensive chances to potentially hold a draw through repetition or stalemate tricks.

2025-06-11 22:26:19,390 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.30s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on e8, Bishop on b7, Knight on f6, Pawn on h6, Rook on h3, Rook on g1, Pawn on e6
- White: King on a2, Pawn on h6

**White's king is stuck on a2, and White has only a pawn on h6. Black is completely winning.**

**Immediate threats:**
- White has no threats. Black can focus on checkmating or winning the h6 pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **h3xh6**: Captures the last White pawn, leaving White with only the king. This is the most direct way to remove any drawing chances.
2. **g1g2+**: Check, but White just moves the king between a2 and b3.
3. **Other rook moves**: Not as forcing as capturing the pawn.

**Long-term plan:** 
- Remove the h6 pawn, then coordinate the rooks and bishop/knight to force mate. With two rooks and minor pieces, mate is trivial.

**Short-term tactic:**
- Take the h6 pawn.

**Check for stalemate:** 
- After h3xh6, White's king still has a2 and b3 squares, so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:** 
The best move is to capture the pawn on h6.

2025-06-11 22:26:38,396 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.74s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k3/1b5p/4pn1r/8/8/8/K7/6r1 w - - 0 104

Key features of the position:
1. White has a lone king on a2
2. Black has king on e8, bishop on b7, pawn on h7, knight on f6, rook on h6, and rook on g1
3. White is to move and has only 3 legal king moves: a2b3, a2a3, a2b2

This is a clearly lost position for White. Black has overwhelming material advantage and can easily promote the h-pawn or coordinate their pieces to deliver checkmate. Our only hope is to prolong the game as much as possible in hopes of a stalemate or reaching the 50-move rule.

Let's evaluate each move:

1. a2b3:
   - Moves the king towards the center but closer to Black's rook on g1
   - Black can play ...h5-h4-h3 threatening to promote
   - King is more exposed to checks

2. a2a3:
   - Keeps the king on the a-file
   - Slightly safer as it's further from Black's rook
   - Still doesn't prevent Black's pawn push

3. a2b2:
   - Moves the king towards Black's bishop
   - Potentially dangerous as the bishop can check from a4
   - Doesn't improve our position

The best choice is a2a3 as it:
- Keeps the king as far as possible from Black's pieces
- Doesn't immediately walk into any checks
- Maintains maximum flexibility for future moves

While the position is lost, this move prolongs the game the most.

2025-06-11 22:26:45,089 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.41s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4k3/1b5p/4pn1r/8/8/K7/8/6r1 b - - 1 104

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Bishop (b7), Knight (f6), Pawn (h7), Rook (g1), Rook (h6)
- White: King (a3)

**White has only a king left, Black has overwhelming material.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- No immediate threats from White.
- Black can checkmate with correct coordination.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rg3** (to cut off the king and prepare mate)
2. **Rh2** (threatening mate with Ra1#)
3. **Rh4** (cutting off the king)
4. **Nd4** (centralizing, but not necessary)
5. **Kf7** (improving king, but not urgent)
6. **Bc6** (not relevant)
7. **e5** (not relevant)
8. **g1g8** (not relevant)

**Checkmate patterns:**  
- The White king is on a3, with no escape squares.
- If Black can get a rook to a1, it's mate.
- The h6 rook can swing to a6, but needs a clear path.
- The g1 rook can go to a1 via g1-a1, but a3 is occupied by the king.
- The h6 rook can go to h2, then a2, then a3, but a3 is occupied.

**Best plan:**  
- Use the h6 rook to cut off the king.
- Bring the bishop to d5 to control the b3 square.
- Use the knight to control escape squares.

But the fastest is to use the rook to cut off the king.

**Move: Rh2**  
- This threatens Ra2# (if the king moves to b4 or b3).
- If the king stays on a3, Black can bring the other rook to a1 and mate.

**Check for immediate mate:**  
- Rg3 does not threaten mate.
- Rh2 is the most direct, threatening to bring the rook to a2 or a1.

**Final decision:**  
The move **Rh2** is the most forcing, as it prepares to bring the rook to a2 and then mate, or to a1 if the king moves.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
h6h2

2025-06-11 22:27:06,486 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 21.11s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k3/1b5p/4pn2/8/8/K7/7r/6r1 w - - 2 105

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king, Black has king+bishop+pawn+2 rooks)
2. White's king is exposed and under heavy attack
3. Black has two rooks on the g and h files threatening mate
4. Black's bishop on b7 controls important squares
5. White's king is trapped in the corner with limited mobility

Legal moves are a3b4, a3a4, a3b3. Let's evaluate each:

1. a3b4:
   - Moves towards the center but exposes king to more checks
   - Black can play Rg1+ forcing Kb5 then Rh1 threatening mate
   - Very dangerous as it opens more lines for black's rooks

2. a3a4:
   - Similar problems as a3b4
   - Black can play Rg1+ Ka5 Rh1 threatening mate
   - Still leaves king very exposed

3. a3b3:
   - Keeps king slightly more protected
   - After Rg1+, Kb2 is possible
   - Still difficult but offers slightly more resistance
   - Potentially blocks the bishop's diagonal temporarily

The position is extremely difficult for White. Black has a forced win here as the rooks can coordinate to deliver mate. However, a3b3 offers the most resistance by:
- Keeping the king closer to the corner where it's slightly harder to attack
- Potentially interfering with the bishop's control
- Delaying the inevitable the longest

While the position is lost, a3b3 makes Black work hardest to prove the win. The other moves allow quicker mating attacks.

2025-06-11 22:27:13,235 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.46s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on e8, Bishop on b7, Knight on f6, Rooks on h2 and g1, Pawn on h7  
- White: King on b3

**White has only a king. Black has overwhelming material: 2 rooks, bishop, knight, and a pawn.**

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- White's king is on b3, with no pawns or pieces to help.
- Black's pieces are well placed to restrict the White king.
- The Black rooks on h2 and g1 are far from the action but can swing over.
- The bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- The knight on f6 can help with mating nets.
- The Black king is safe.

**Goal:**  
- Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Move the rook to the second rank to cut off the White king: h2-b2, h2-c2, etc.
- Move the bishop to control more squares: b7-d5, b7-e4, etc.
- Move the knight to help with the mate: f6-d5, f6-g4, etc.
- Move the king closer: e8-f7, e8-d7, etc.

**Best plan:**  
- Use the rook to cut off the White king's escape squares.
- Use the bishop and knight to restrict the king further.
- Avoid stalemating the White king.

**Let's check if there is an immediate mate:**
- Rook to b2: h2b2. This cuts off the b-file, and the White king is on b3.
- After h2b2, White's only move is Ka3 or Kc3 (if possible).
- If Ka3, then Rg1-a1 is mate.
- If Kc3, then Rg1-c1 is mate.

But let's check the move h2b2:

1. ... h2b2
2. Kc3 (only move)
3. Rg1-c1#
or
2. Ka3
3. Rg1-a1#

So, **h2b2** leads to forced mate in one after the king moves.

**Double-check for stalemate:**  
- After h2b2, White still has legal moves (Ka3, Kc3), so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
h2b2
```

2025-06-11 22:27:33,921 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.18s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current position:
- White has a lone king on b3
- Black has:
  - King on f6
  - Rook on b2
  - Pawn on h2 (which is about to promote)

Key observations:
1. Black's h-pawn is on h2 and will promote next move if not stopped
2. Black's rook is already controlling the b-file
3. White's king is somewhat restricted in movement

Possible moves for White:
1. b3c4 - moves towards the h-pawn but may be too slow
2. b3a4 - moves away from the rook's control but away from the h-pawn
3. b3c3 - stays near current position
4. b3a3 - moves towards the a-file
5. b3b2 - captures the rook but allows h-pawn promotion

Let's evaluate each:

1. b3c4:
- After Kc4, Black plays h1=Q
- White cannot stop the queen from checking and eventually mating

2. b3a4:
- After Ka4, Black plays h1=Q
- White is far from the action and will be mated

3. b3c3:
- After Kc3, Black plays h1=Q
- Similar problems as above

4. b3a3:
- After Ka3, Black plays h1=Q
- Again, White is in trouble

5. b3b2:
- Takes the rook: Kxb2
- Then Black promotes: h1=Q
- Now White has Kb2 vs Qh1
- This is a theoretically lost position, but it's the most resistant option

The best practical chance is to eliminate the rook first, as the queen vs king ending gives some tiny hope for a stalemate trap, whereas allowing both the rook and queen would be completely hopeless.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
b3b2
```

2025-06-11 22:27:34,447 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:27:40,601 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.15s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Bishop (b7), Knight (f6), Pawn (h7), Rook (g1), Pawn (e6)
- White: King (b2)

**Black to move.**

**Threats and Evaluation:**
- Black is up a huge amount of material: bishop, knight, rook, and pawn vs lone king.
- White has no pawns and only the king.
- There are no stalemate tricks: White's king on b2 has escape squares (a3, b3, c3, a1, c1).
- The only thing to watch for is not to stalemate the White king.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **Rook moves:** The rook can cut off the White king or check.
   - g1g2: Cuts off the king from the second rank.
   - g1g4: Cuts off the king from the fourth rank.
   - g1g3: Cuts off the king from the third rank.
   - g1g5/g6/g7/g8: Not as forcing.
2. **King moves:** e8f8, e8d8, e8f7, etc. Not urgent.
3. **Bishop moves:** b7c8, b7a8, b7c6, b7a6, b7d5, b7e4, b7f3, b7g2, b7h1. Bishop can help restrict the king.
4. **Knight moves:** f6g8, f6d7, f6h5, f6d5, f6g4, f6e4. Knight can help restrict the king.
5. **Pawn moves:** h7h6, h7h5, e6e5. Not urgent.

**Best Plan:**
- The fastest way to checkmate is to use the rook to cut the king, then bring the king in, or coordinate rook and bishop/knight for a forced mate.
- The move **g1g2** is strong: it cuts off the White king from the second rank, forcing it to the first rank, which is a step toward checkmate.

**Check for Stalemate:**
- After g1g2, White can play Kc3, Ka3, Kc1, or Ka1. No stalemate.

**Alternative:**
- Rook to g4 or g3 also restricts the king, but g2 is most direct.

**Final Move:**
```
g1g2
```

2025-06-11 22:28:01,874 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.66s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current position:
- White: King on b2, pawn on h5
- Black: King on f6, rook on g2, pawn on h7
- It's White's move (turn 107)

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (king + pawn vs king + rook + pawn), but the rook gives Black a decisive advantage
2. Black's rook is already controlling the 2nd rank
3. Black's h-pawn is one move from queening (h7-h6-h7-h8=Q)
4. White's h-pawn is blocked by Black's king
5. White's king is confined to the a/b files due to Black's rook control

Possible moves for White:
1. b2c3 - moves king towards center but allows Black to push h-pawn
2. b2b3 - similar to above
3. b2a3 - moves king away from potential checks
4. b2c1 - moves king back
5. b2b1 - stays near current position
6. b2a1 - moves to corner

Best defensive strategy:
- Try to delay Black's pawn promotion as long as possible
- Avoid allowing Black's king to assist in the promotion
- Keep the king near the a1 corner to minimize rook's checking power

After careful consideration, b2a1 is the most resilient move because:
1. It moves the king to the corner where it's harder for the rook to deliver checks
2. It maintains some flexibility to move to a2 if needed
3. It doesn't immediately allow Black's h-pawn to advance with tempo
4. It's the only move that doesn't potentially walk into future rook checks

While the position is technically lost, this move makes Black work hardest to convert their advantage.

2025-06-11 22:28:10,538 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.28s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on e8, Bishop on b7, Pawn on f6, Pawn on e6, Pawn on h7, Rook on g2  
- White: King on a1

**White's king is stuck on a1, completely boxed in by its own pawnless position and Black's pieces. Black has a rook on g2, bishop on b7, and pawns on f6, e6, h7.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black is completely winning. White has no pieces and no moves.  
- The only thing to be careful of is stalemating the White king.

**Candidate moves:**
- Rook moves: g2-g1, g2-g3, g2-g4, etc.  
- Bishop moves: b7-c8, b7-a8, b7-c6, etc.  
- King moves: e8-f8, e8-d8, etc.  
- Pawn moves: e6-e5, h7-h6, h7-h5

**Plan:**  
- The White king is stuck on a1, so the only way to avoid stalemate is to keep giving it a square to move to, or to checkmate it.
- The most direct way to checkmate is to bring the rook to a2 (g2-a2), then play bishop to d5 (if needed), and then mate with Ra1#.
- But currently, the bishop on b7 covers a8, so the king has no moves. If we move the bishop, the king will have a move, so we can proceed.

**Check for stalemate:**  
- If Black plays g2-a2, the king is not stalemated because it can move to b1 (since the bishop is on b7).
- If Black plays g2-a2, then next move Ra1# is mate.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- No, this is the fastest.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
g2a2
```

2025-06-11 22:28:30,033 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 18.98s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 4k3/1b5p/4pn2/8/8/8/r7/K7 w - - 3 108

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king, Black has king+bishop+pawn)
2. Black has a passed h-pawn that's close to promotion
3. White's king is confined to the a-file
4. Black's rook is controlling the a-file
5. Black's bishop controls the long diagonal

Legal moves are a1a2 or a1b1. Let's evaluate both:

1. a1a2:
This would walk into the rook's control. After a1a2, Black can play a2a2, then:
- If White takes a2a2, Black plays b7a6+ skewering the king
- If White doesn't take, Black can push the h-pawn

2. a1b1:
This seems more resilient. It keeps the king connected to potential future squares while avoiding immediate skewers. Black's main threat is pushing the h-pawn, but White's king might have more mobility to oppose it.

The position is extremely difficult for White, but a1b1 offers more resistance by:
- Avoiding immediate material loss
- Potentially allowing the king to move toward the h-pawn in future moves
- Keeping options open for opposition against the pawn

After a1b1, Black will likely push h5-h4, but White's king can start moving toward it via b1-c1 etc. While the position remains lost, this gives the most practical chances.

```

2025-06-11 22:28:40,325 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.92s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Bishop (b7), Knight (f6), Pawn (e6), Pawn (h7), Rook (a2)
- White: King (b1)

**Position:**
- White's king is on b1, boxed in by Black's rook on a2 and bishop on b7.
- Black's rook on a2 cuts off the second rank.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal and covers c8, a8, etc.
- Black's knight and pawns are centralized and can help in mating nets.
- White has no pieces except the king.

**Goal:** 
- Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible, avoid stalemate, and prevent any escape.

**Immediate Candidate Moves:**
1. Rook moves: a2-a8, a2-a7, etc. But a2-a1+ is not mate, as White can go to c2.
2. Bishop moves: b7-c8, b7-a8, b7-c6, etc. But moving the bishop away from b7 allows White's king to escape to a2.
3. Knight moves: f6-g8, f6-d7, f6-h5, etc.
4. King moves: e8-f8, e8-d8, etc.
5. Pawn moves: h7-h6, e6-e5, h7-h5.

**Key Considerations:**
- Do not stalemate White's king (currently, White can move to a2 or c1).
- The Black rook on a2 is perfectly placed to cut off the second rank.
- The bishop on b7 covers c8 and a8, so the king cannot escape that way.
- The knight can be repositioned to help with a mating net.

**Best Plan:**
- Bring the king closer to help with mate.
- Use the knight to cover c1, so that after Ra1+, Kc2 is not possible.
- Alternatively, use the bishop to cover c1, then deliver Ra1#.

**Calculation:**
- If ...Nd5, then the knight covers c1, and Ra1# is mate.
- But currently, the knight cannot go to d5 in one move.
- If ...Nd7, then ...Nc5, then ...Ra1# is mate.

But let's check if there is a forced mate in a few moves.

**Move 1: ...Nd7**
- Prepares Nc5, covering c1.
- White has no moves except Kc1 or Ka1 (but both are not possible, as a1 is occupied and c1 is legal).
- After ...Nd7, White plays Kc1.
- Then ...Nc5, and now c1 is covered.
- Now ...Ra1# is mate.

But after ...Nd7, if White plays Kc1, then ...Nc5, and White has to go back to b1.

Alternatively, let's see if ...Ra8 or ...Ra3+ does anything. No, as White can just move back and forth.

**What about ...Be4+?**
- Not useful, as White just moves Kc1.

**What about ...Bd5?**
- Not possible, as the bishop is on b7.

**What about ...Be4+?**
- Not useful.

**What about ...Ra3?**
- Not useful.

**What about ...Nd5?**
- Not possible.

**What about ...Be4+?**
- Not useful.

**What about ...Nd7?**
- This is the best move, as it prepares Nc5, and then Ra1#.

**Summary:**
- The best move is to play ...Nd7, preparing Nc5, and then Ra1#.

**Final Move:**
```

2025-06-11 22:29:00,022 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 19.19s):
Let me analyze this position deeply.

Current FEN: 4k3/1b1n3p/4p3/8/8/8/r7/1K6 w - - 5 109

Key features:
1. Material is equal (White has king, Black has king, bishop, knight and pawn)
2. White's king is on b1, Black's rook on a2 is pinning White's king to the back rank
3. Black has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h7
4. Black's pieces are more active (bishop on b7, knight on d7)
5. White has only king moves available (b1a2 or b1c1)

Let's examine both legal moves:

1. b1a2:
- Moves into the pin, but captures the rook
- After a2xb7, Black can play h7-h5-h4-h3 etc. promoting the pawn
- White's king is too far to stop the pawn
- Black can also bring knight to support promotion

2. b1c1:
- Keeps the rook pinned but doesn't capture it
- Black can continue improving position with moves like h7-h5
- Eventually Black can bring king to support the pawn
- White has no counterplay

After careful consideration, b1a2 is forced as it's the only way to eliminate the immediate threat of the rook. While the h-pawn will promote, capturing the rook gives White some slim chances if Black makes mistakes in the pawn promotion process.

The alternative b1c1 just delays the inevitable as Black can slowly improve their position while White's king remains passive.

2025-06-11 22:29:00,446 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:29:06,432 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.99s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King (e8), Bishop (b7), Knight (d7), Pawn (e6), Pawn (h7)
- White: King (a2)

**Black to move.**

**Assessment:**
- Black is completely winning. White has only the king, while Black has a bishop, knight, and two pawns.
- The White king is on the edge (a2), and Black's pieces are centralized and coordinated.
- The only thing to be careful of is stalemating White, as White has no legal moves except with the king.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6e5**: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't threaten anything immediately.
2. **h7h6**: Prepares to push the h-pawn, but not urgent.
3. **d7c5**: Knight closer to the White king, but not threatening.
4. **d7e5**: Knight centralizes.
5. **d7f6**: Knight to f6, but not directly threatening.
6. **b7d5**: Bishop to d5, controls more squares.
7. **b7c6**: Bishop to c6, not threatening.
8. **e8f7**: King to f7, centralizing.
9. **e8d8**: King to d8, centralizing.

**Best plan:**
- The quickest way to win is to use the bishop and knight to restrict the White king, then bring the king in and push the pawns.
- There is no immediate mate, but we can start by activating the king.

**Move selection:**
- **e8f7**: King to f7, centralizing and preparing to support pawn advances. This is a classic endgame technique: bring the king closer.
- **d7c5**: Knight to c5, attacks a4 and b3, but White king is on a2, so not urgent.
- **b7d5**: Bishop to d5, cuts off the king further.

Of these, **e8f7** is the most flexible and keeps all options open.

**Final move:**
```
e8f7

Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b1n1k1p/4p3/8/8/8/K7/8 w - - 1 110

Key features:
- White has a lone king on a2
- Black has king on f7, bishop on b7, knight on d7, and pawn on h7
- White is to move

Legal moves for White's king: a2b3, a2a3, a2b2, a2b1, a2a1

This is a lost position for White, but we must play the most stubborn defense possible to maximize chances of a mistake from Black. The key is to keep our king as active as possible and try to prevent Black from coordinating their pieces effectively.

Let's evaluate each move:
1. a2a1 - moves king to corner, which is usually bad as it reduces activity
2. a2b1 - similar to a1, not ideal
3. a2b2 - keeps king more active, but still not optimal
4. a2a3 - moves toward center, but might allow Black to push pawn
5. a2b3 - most active move, keeps king centralized

The best practical chance is a2b3, keeping the king active and ready to move toward the center if needed. This makes it harder for Black to coordinate their pieces to promote the h-pawn.

2025-06-11 22:29:35,201 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 11.05s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on f7, knight on d7, bishop on b7, pawns on e6 and h7.
- White: King on b3.

**Black is up a bishop and knight, and has two pawns vs. just the White king.**

**Threats and Plans:**
- White has no counterplay; it's just a matter of converting the win.
- The only thing Black must avoid is stalemate or accidental perpetual.
- The quickest win is to use the king and minor pieces to force the White king to the edge and deliver mate, or promote a pawn.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **e6-e5**: Advance the pawn, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.
2. **h7-h6**: Prepares h5-h4-h3, but not urgent.
3. **King moves (f7-g8, f7-f8, f7-e8, etc.):** King is well placed, but could centralize.
4. **Knight moves (d7-f8, d7-b8, d7-f6, d7-b6, d7-e5, d7-c5):** Knight can help restrict the White king.
5. **Bishop moves (b7-c8, b7-a8, etc.):** Bishop can help cut off the White king.

**Best Plan:**
- Use the bishop to cut off the White king from the c-file.
- Use the knight to help restrict the king.
- Advance the e-pawn to promote, but only when the king is cut off.

**Best Move:**
- **Bishop to d5** would be ideal, but not possible now.
- **Bishop to d5** is not legal, but **Bishop to d5** would cut off the king.
- **Bishop to d5** is not legal, but **Bishop to d5** would cut off the king.
- **Bishop to d5** is not legal, but **Bishop to d5** would cut off the king.

So, let's look at **b7d5**: Not legal.

So, let's look at **b7c6**: This attacks the b3 square, further restricting the White king. If the king moves to a3, then we can play knight c5, and the king is boxed in.

Alternatively, **d7c5** immediately restricts the king to a3 and b3. Then, bishop can move to d5, and the king is boxed in.

But **d7c5** is legal and strong.

**Let's check for stalemate:**
- If knight goes to c5, White king has a3 and b3.
- No stalemate.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
d7c5
```

2025-06-11 22:29:57,295 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 21.34s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/4p3/2n5/8/1K6/8/8 w - - 3 111

This is a king and pawn endgame where White's king is at b3 and Black has:
- King at f7
- Bishop at b7
- Knight at c5
- Pawn at h7
- Pawn at e6

White has only a king, but it's White's move. The immediate concern is that Black has multiple threats:
1. Black's knight can fork our king with ...Nd3+
2. Black's bishop controls the a6-f1 diagonal
3. Black can push passed pawns

Our king needs to find the most active square while preventing Black's threats. Let's evaluate the legal moves:

1. b3c4 - moves towards center, attacks knight
2. b3b4 - moves away from center, less active
3. b3c3 - keeps pressure on knight but less central
4. b3a3 - moves away from action
5. b3c2 - moves down, not helpful
6. b3b2 - retreats, not good
7. b3a2 - retreats, bad

The best move is b3c4 because:
- It attacks the knight immediately
- Centralizes the king
- Prevents ...Nd3+ fork
- Prepares to potentially help stop pawns
- Limits Black's options

After Kc4, Black will likely move the knight (probably to e4 or a6), but we'll have more active play. This is the most principled move that maintains maximum activity while reducing Black's threats.

2025-06-11 22:30:05,271 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.37s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Bishop on b7, Pawn on e6, Pawn on h7, Knight on c5  
- White: King on c4

**Black to move.**

**Positional factors:**  
- White's king is far from Black's pawns and pieces.
- Black has a bishop, knight, and two pawns versus just a king.
- Black's e6 pawn is ready to advance.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal and can help restrict the White king.
- Black's knight on c5 is centralized and can jump to key squares.
- Black's king is safe on f7.

**Immediate tactics:**  
- No immediate mate, but Black can push for a win.
- The e6 pawn can advance, but let's check if there are any tactical shots with the knight or bishop.
- The move h7-h6 or h7-h5 is not urgent; the pawn is safe for now.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e6-e5**: Push the pawn, restrict the White king, and prepare to bring the king closer.
2. **h7-h6**: A waiting move, but not urgent.
3. **Bishop moves**: Not much to do; the bishop is well-placed.
4. **Knight moves**: c5-d7, c5-e4, c5-a4, c5-d3, c5-b3. Let's check if any of these are strong.
   - **c5-e4**: Attacks the White king, but the king can move to b5 or d3.
   - **c5-d7**: Retreat, not needed.
   - **c5-b3**: King can go to b5.
   - **c5-d3**: King can go to d5.
   - **c5-a4**: King can go to b5.

**Strategic plan:**  
- Advance the e-pawn to e5, restrict the White king, and then bring the king closer to support the pawn and coordinate with the bishop and knight for a checkmate or to promote the pawn.

**Tactical check:**  
- e6-e5: If White plays Kxc5, then Ne4+ wins the king forking square, but the king can't take on c5.
- e6-e5: White's king can't approach the pawns or pieces easily.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to push the e-pawn and restrict the White king.

**Final move:**
```
e6e5

2025-06-11 22:30:24,982 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 19.05s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/2n1p3/2K5/8/8/8 w - - 0 112

Key features:
1. Material: White has just a king (Kc4), Black has king (Kf7), bishop (Bb7), knight (Nc5) and pawn (h7)
2. White's king is somewhat active but surrounded by black pieces
3. Black has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous
4. Black's pieces are coordinating well to restrict white's king
5. White is in zugzwang - any king move will worsen the position

Legal moves: c4c5, c4b5, c4b4, c4c3

Let's evaluate each:
1. c4c5 - moves towards the knight, but after Nxc5 Kxc5 Bxe5, black wins the e-pawn and has bishop vs. bare king
2. c4b5 - moves towards the bishop, but Bc6 traps the king and black can push the e-pawn
3. c4b4 - moves away from control of e5, allowing e4 followed by e3 with a winning pawn
4. c4c3 - seems the least bad, keeping some control over d4 and e5

After c4c3:
- Black can play e4 (but white's king can approach via d2)
- Or Nxb3 Kxb3 e4 Kc2 e3 Kd1 - but black still has to be careful with the bishop

All moves lose, but c4c3 offers the most resistance by keeping some control over key squares. The position is objectively lost for white due to black's material advantage and coordinated pieces.

2025-06-11 22:30:31,617 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.86s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Bishop on b7, Knight on c5, pawns on e5 and h7  
- White: King on c3

**Black's advantages:**  
- Up a bishop and knight, plus two pawns.  
- White has only a king, so this is a technical win for Black, but must avoid stalemate and be careful.

**Immediate threats:**  
- No immediate stalemate threats; White's king has squares.
- Black should avoid unnecessary pawn moves that could limit White's king and accidentally stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**  
1. **e5e4+**: Pushes the pawn with check, forcing the White king to move. This gains space and keeps the initiative.
2. **h7h6**: Useful waiting move, but not urgent.
3. **Move the bishop**: Not necessary; it's well-placed.
4. **Move the knight**: Could consider Nc5-e4+ or Nc5-d7, but e4+ is not check, so not urgent.

**Best plan:**  
- Push the e-pawn with check, drive the king back, and use the bishop and knight to restrict the king and promote a pawn.

**Check for stalemate after e5e4+:**  
- If Kd4, then Ne6+ or Ne4+ is possible.
- If Kc2, then e3 is coming.
- No stalemate risk.

**Final move:**  
The best move is to push the e-pawn with check.

2025-06-11 22:30:49,181 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.66s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/2n5/4p3/2K5/8/8 w - - 0 113

Key features:
- White has a lone king at c3
- Black has king at f7, bishop at b7, knight at c5, pawn at e4, and pawn at h7
- White is to move in this desperate position

Looking at the legal moves:
1. c3d4 - moves towards the e4 pawn but allows ...Nxd4 winning the king
2. c3c4 - moves away but allows ...Nb3+ winning the king
3. c3b4 - moves towards the bishop but allows ...Nd3+ winning the king
4. c3d2 - moves away but allows ...Nb3+ winning the king
5. c3c2 - seems safest but allows ...Nd3+ winning the king
6. c3b2 - moves towards the bishop but allows ...Nd3+ winning the king

After careful analysis, all king moves lead to immediate loss through knight forks. The position is completely lost for White as any move allows Black to win the king with a knight fork. There is no way to prevent this.

Since we must make a move, I'll choose the one that delays the inevitable the longest:

```
c3c2
```

This at least forces Black to find the correct sequence to win the king. However, Black can simply reply with ...Nd3+ followed by ...Nxc1, winning the king next move. The position is hopeless for White.

2025-06-11 22:30:55,766 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.76s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, bishop on b7, knight on c5, pawn on e4, pawn on h7  
- White: King on c2

**Position:**  
- Black is up a bishop, knight, and two pawns.  
- White's king is cut off on the queenside, and has no pawns or pieces.  
- Black's king is safe, and Black can win easily by pushing the e-pawn, bringing the king, or using the minor pieces to restrict the white king.

**Immediate threats:**  
- No immediate threats from White.  
- Black can push the e-pawn, but must be careful not to stalemate the white king.

**Candidate moves:**  
- e4-e3: Pushes the pawn, but after Kd1, e2+ is not mate, and White's king can try to run.  
- Nc5-d3: Brings the knight closer, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.  
- h7-h6/h7-h5: Not urgent, but can be played to avoid back-rank stalemates in the future.  
- Bc5-d3: Brings the bishop closer, but again, not urgent.  
- Kf7-e6/f6: Centralizes the king, but not urgent.

**Best plan:**  
- Push the e-pawn, but do not stalemate the white king.  
- Use the knight and bishop to restrict the white king's movement.  
- Bring the king closer if needed.

**Check for stalemate:**  
- If e3 and White plays Kd1, then e2+ and Kd2, then e1=Q is not stalemate, as White's king has squares.

**Best move:**  
- e3 is the most direct, as it pushes the passed pawn and restricts the white king.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
e4e3
```

2025-06-11 22:31:14,075 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.59s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/2n5/8/4p3/2K5/8 w - - 0 114

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal (White has king, Black has king, bishop, knight and pawn)
2. Black has a passed e-pawn that's one square from promotion
3. White's king is somewhat active but needs to deal with multiple threats
4. Black's pieces are coordinating well - the knight on c5 controls key squares

Looking at the legal moves:
1. c2c3 - moves towards the e-pawn but allows ...Nxb3 winning material
2. c2b2 - moves towards the e-pawn but allows ...Nd3+ winning the bishop
3. c2d1 - moves away from the e-pawn but keeps the king active
4. c2c1 - retreats the king but seems passive
5. c2b1 - similar to c2c1 but even more passive

The critical issue is that after any king move towards the e-pawn (c3/b2), Black can win material with either the knight or bishop. The e-pawn is about to promote, so we must prevent that while not losing material.

After deep consideration, the best move is:
```
c2d1
```

This:
1. Keeps the king active and central
2. Prepares to approach the e-pawn via d1-e2
3. Doesn't allow any immediate tactical blows from Black
4. Maintains flexibility to respond to Black's threats

Other moves either allow material loss or are too passive. While the position remains difficult, this is the most resilient move that gives White the best practical chances.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on f7, bishop on b7, knight on c5, pawn on e3, pawn on h7
- White: King on d1

**Black to move.**

**White's king is cut off on the first rank and cannot approach the pawns. Black has a passed e-pawn on e3, and White has no counterplay.**

**Immediate threats:**
- The e-pawn is two squares from queening.
- The bishop on b7 covers the long diagonal.
- The knight on c5 controls key squares.

**Candidate moves:**
1. e3-e2: Push the pawn, threatening to queen next move. White cannot stop it.
2. h7-h6/h5: Not urgent.
3. King moves: Not necessary.
4. Bishop moves: Not urgent.
5. Knight moves: Not urgent.

**Is there any stalemate risk?**
- If e2, White's king is on d1 and has c1, c2, e1, e2, d2 available. But after e2, if White does nothing, Black can play e1=Q next move.

**Is there any way for White to draw?**
- No. White's king is far from the action, and Black will queen easily.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- After e2, e1=Q is unstoppable. Black can then use the queen, bishop, and knight to force mate.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the pawn:

```
e3e2

Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/2n5/8/8/4p3/3K4 w - - 0 115

Material count:
- White: King
- Black: King, bishop, knight, pawn on e2, pawn on h7

This is a completely lost position for White. Black has two pawns (one of which is very close to promotion) plus two minor pieces against a bare king. The only question is whether we can prolong the game or create any stalemate opportunities.

Our king is on d1. Let's examine each legal move:

1. d1e2 - moves towards the pawn, but after ...e1=Q+ we lose immediately
2. d1d2 - blocks the pawn's path, but black can play ...Bxd2 or ...Nxd2 winning easily
3. d1c2 - moves away, but black can push ...e1=Q+ 
4. d1e1 - takes the pawn, but after ...Bxe1 it's mate in a few moves
5. d1c1 - moves the king to the corner, which might be the most resilient

The best practical chance is d1c1, hoping for black to make a mistake in the conversion. From c1, the king is slightly safer from immediate mating threats. While the position is objectively lost, this move makes it hardest for black to coordinate their pieces to deliver mate or promote the pawn.

2025-06-11 22:31:38,188 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:31:42,447 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.26s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Bishop on b7, Knight on c5, Pawn on e2, Pawn on h7  
- White: King on c1

**Black to move.**

**Immediate threats and evaluation:**
- Black is completely winning: up a bishop, knight, and two pawns, with a pawn on e2 ready to promote.
- White's king is far from the action and cannot stop the e-pawn.
- No White pieces remain, so no counterplay is possible.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e2e1=Q**: Promote the pawn to a queen. This is the most forcing move and immediately increases Black's material advantage.
2. **e2e1=N/B/R**: Underpromotion is unnecessary; queen is best.
3. **Other moves** (bishop, knight, king, h7-h6/h5): None of these are as strong as queening.

**Check for stalemate:**
- After e2e1=Q, White's king on c1 will have c2 and b1 as escape squares, so not stalemate.

**Check for fastest mate:**
- After e2e1=Q, Black can bring the queen and bishop/knight to force mate quickly. No need to delay.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/2n5/8/8/8/2K1q3 w - - 0 116

The position is:
- White has only a king at c1
- Black has:
  - King at f7
  - Bishop at b7
  - Knight at c5
  - Pawn at h7
  - Queen at e1

Legal moves: c1c2 or c1b2

This is a clearly lost position for White. Black has overwhelming material advantage (queen, bishop, knight vs bare king) and can force checkmate. Our only hope is to prolong the game in hopes of a stalemate or reaching the 50-move rule.

Let's evaluate the two options:

1. c1c2:
- Moves the king towards the center
- Black can continue harassing with queen checks
- May allow black to coordinate pieces more easily

2. c1b2:
- Moves the king towards the edge
- Potentially more chances for stalemate traps
- The bishop on b7 controls the a8-h1 diagonal, but our king would be moving away from it
- The queen can still give checks from multiple directions

Between these, c1b2 seems slightly better because:
- It moves the king away from the bishop's diagonal
- It keeps the king closer to the corner (a1), which might help in setting up potential stalemate traps
- It doesn't immediately walk into any obvious mating nets

While the position is objectively lost, c1b2 gives slightly more chances for Black to make a mistake or potentially reach a stalemate.

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```

2025-06-11 22:32:06,458 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.11s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: Queen (e1), Bishop (b7), King (f7), Knight (c5), Pawn (h7)
- White: King (b2)

**White's king is on b2, with no pawns or pieces. Black has overwhelming material.**

**Immediate threats/checkmates:**  
- The White king is on b2, and Black's queen is on e1, bishop on b7, knight on c5, king on f7.
- The Black queen can check on d2, c3, b4, a5, etc.
- The Black bishop on b7 covers a8-h1 diagonal, including c6, d5, e4, f3, g2, h1.
- The knight on c5 covers b3, d3, e4, e6, b7, a4, a6, d7.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qd2+**: Forces the king to a3 or b1 (since a1 is covered by the queen, c1 is covered by the queen, c3 is covered by the queen and knight).
2. **Qb4+**: King can only go to a2.
3. **Na4+**: King can only go to a3.
4. **Nd3+**: King can only go to a3 or b1.
5. **Qe2+**: King can only go to a3 or b1.

Let's check **Qd2+**:

- 1... Qd2+  
  - If 2. Ka3, then ... Qc3# is mate (bishop on b7 covers a8-h1 diagonal, knight on c5 covers b3).
  - If 2. Kb1, then ... Be4+ is mate (king can't go to a2 or c1, both covered by queen and bishop).

So, **Qd2+** is a forced mate in 2.

**Verification:**
- 1... Qd2+ 2. Ka3 Qc3# (bishop covers b2, knight covers b3, queen covers all other squares)
- 1... Qd2+ 2. Kb1 Be4+ (king can't move anywhere, that's mate)

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e1d2
```

2025-06-11 22:32:21,885 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.16s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/2n5/8/8/1K1q4/8 w - - 2 117

Key features:
- White has only a king on b2
- Black has:
  - King on f7
  - Bishop on b7
  - Knight on c5
  - Pawn on h7
  - Queen on d2 (attacking white's king)

White's legal moves: b2a3, b2b1, b2a1

This is a completely lost position for White. Black has overwhelming material advantage and can force checkmate in a few moves regardless of what White does. The black queen already controls all squares around the white king, and black has additional pieces to deliver mate.

Let's examine each option:
1. b2a3 - allows Qb2# next move
2. b2b1 - allows Qb2# next move
3. b2a1 - delays mate by one move, but black can still force mate quickly with accurate play

Since all moves lead to forced mate, the most stubborn is b2a1, making black work a bit harder to deliver mate. After b2a1, black would likely play Qc1+ forcing Ka2, then Qb2+ Ka1, and can bring other pieces to deliver mate.

While the position is hopeless, we should make the most stubborn move to force black to demonstrate the win.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Bishop on b7, Knight on c5, Queen on d2, Pawn on h7  
- White: King on a1

**Black to move.**

**White's king is on a1, and Black's pieces are dominating the board.**  
- The Black queen on d2 controls the second rank and the a2 square.
- The bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- The knight on c5 covers key squares around the White king.
- The king is safe on f7.
- The pawn on h7 can be advanced if needed.

**Immediate threats:**  
- The White king is stuck on the a-file and cannot escape.
- Black can try to deliver checkmate or force mate in a few moves.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qd1+**: Forces the White king to b2, but then what?
2. **Nb3+**: Forces the king to b2, but then what?
3. **Bd5**: Not forcing.
4. **Qe1+**: Not possible.
5. **Qd4+**: Not possible.
6. **Qe2**: Not forcing.
7. **Qb4**: Not forcing.

Let's look at **Qd1+**:
- 1...Qd1+ 2. Ka2 (only move)
- Now, what next? Let's see if there is a forced mate.

Alternatively, **Nb3+**:
- 1...Nb3+ 2. Kb2 (only move)
- Now, Qc1# is checkmate.

Let me check that:
- 1...Nb3+ 2. Kb2 Qc1#

Yes, that's mate.

Legal moves in UCI notation: a1b1

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-11 22:32:39,535 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 12.09s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/1n6/3q4/K7 w - - 4 118

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (White has king vs Black has king + bishop + knight + pawn)
2. White is in a desperate situation with the king on a1 and Black's queen controlling most squares
3. The only legal move is a1b1 (king moves to b1)
4. Black has multiple threats including queen checks and potential discovered attacks

Looking at possible continuations:
- After a1b1, Black can play qd2 with a discovered attack on our king by the bishop on b7
- Or Black could play qc1+ forcing our king back to a1
- Alternatively, Black might play qb2+ forcing our king to c1, then bring the knight into play

This appears to be a completely lost position with no realistic drawing chances. The material disadvantage is too great and Black's pieces coordinate well to prevent any counterplay.

Since we must make a move, and a1b1 is the only legal option, we have no choice but to play it. Any delay would just allow Black to improve their position further.

2025-06-11 22:32:43,893 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.13s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: King on f7, Bishop on b7, Knight on b3, Queen on d2, Pawn on h7
- White: King on b1

**Position:**
- White's king is on b1, boxed in by its own position and Black's pieces.
- Black's queen on d2 controls the b2 square and a lot of the board.
- Black's knight on b3 covers a1, c1, d2, and a5.
- Black's bishop on b7 covers e4, f3, g2, h1, and a8.
- Black's king is safe on f7.
- White has no pieces left.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black is completely winning. The White king is trapped on b1 with no escape squares except a1 and c1, both covered by the knight.
- Black can deliver checkmate with Qc1#.

**Check for stalemate:**
- If Black plays Qc1#, the White king is on b1, and all adjacent squares (a1, c1, a2, b2, c2) are covered by Black's pieces or the edge of the board.
- White has no legal moves and is in checkmate.

**Final move:**

2025-06-11 22:33:01,276 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.15s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/1n6/8/1Kq5 w - - 6 119

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (both sides have queen vs bishop+knight)
2. White king is on b1, black queen on c1
3. Black has a knight on b3 and bishop on b7
4. White's only legal move is b1a2 (king moves to a2)

Danger assessment:
- Black has immediate threats with Qc1xa1# if White doesn't move
- The knight on b3 controls a1 and c1 squares
- The bishop on b7 controls the a8-h1 diagonal

Best continuation analysis:
1. b1a2 is forced to avoid immediate mate
After b1a2, possible black responses:
- Qc1-c2 (attacking a2)
- Qc1-b2 (attacking a2 and controlling a1)
- Bishop moves (but unlikely as they're all worse)
- Knight moves (but they lose control of key squares)

The most dangerous response would be Qc1-c2, threatening Qc2xa2#. White would then have to respond with:
- a2a3 (but then Qc2-b2#)
- a2b1 (but Qc2-b2#)
- a2a1 (but Nxb2#)

This leads to forced mate in 3 for Black after b1a2 Qc1c2 a2a1 Nxb2#

However, since b1a2 is the only legal move, we must play it and hope Black makes a mistake. There's no alternative.

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:

2025-06-11 22:33:07,027 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.51s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: Queen (c1), Bishop (b7), Knight (b3), King (f7), Pawn (h7)  
- White: King (a2)

**White has only a king left, Black has overwhelming material.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- The White king is on a2, boxed in by Black's knight on b3 and bishop on b7.  
- The Black queen on c1 controls the c-file and the first rank.  
- Black's king is safe on f7.

**Checkmate ideas:**  
- The White king's only escape squares are a3 and b1, but both are covered by Black's pieces:  
    - b3 covers a1 and a3  
    - Queen on c1 covers c2, c3, b2, b1, etc.  
    - Bishop on b7 covers a8, b8, c8, d8, e5, f3, g2, h1

**Candidate moves:**  
- c1a3: Queen to a3 is checkmate (the knight on b3 covers a1, the queen covers b2 and a3, the bishop covers b7, and the king cannot escape).
- c1a1: Queen to a1 is not mate, as the king is already not on a1.
- c1c2: Queen to c2 is not mate, as the king can still move to a3.
- b3a1: Knight to a1 is not mate, as the king can still move to a3.

**Double-check:**  
- After c1a3, the king on a2 cannot move to a3 (covered by queen), cannot move to b3 (covered by knight), cannot move to b2 (covered by queen), cannot move to a1 (covered by knight), cannot move to b1 (covered by queen).  
- All escape squares are covered.

**Conclusion:**  
The move c1a3 is checkmate.

**Final move:**
```
c1a3
```

2025-06-11 22:33:07,462 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:33:27,969 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 20.51s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/qn6/K7/8 w - - 8 120

Key features of the position:
1. Material is equal - both sides have a queen and bishop (though Black has an extra pawn)
2. White's king is on a2, Black's on f7
3. Black has a passed h-pawn that's close to promotion (h7)
4. Black's queen is very active on a3, attacking White's king
5. White has only two legal moves: a2a3 or a2b1

Let's evaluate both options:

1. a2a3:
- Moves the king towards the center but into the queen's attack
- Black can respond with Qa3xa3 (capturing our king) - this is checkmate!
- Therefore, a2a3 is immediately losing

2. a2b1:
- Moves the king away from the queen's attack
- Black's main threats would be:
   - Qa3xb3 (winning our bishop)
   - Or pushing the h-pawn (h7-h6 then h6-h5 etc.)
- After Qxb3, we'd have Kxb3, but then Black can promote the h-pawn
- However, this is our only non-losing move

The position is actually lost for White because:
- If we don't take the queen (a2b1), Black can just push the h-pawn to promotion
- If we do take the queen (a2a3), it's immediate checkmate
- There's no perpetual check or stalemate possibility

Since a2a3 is immediate checkmate, we must choose a2b1 even though the position is lost. This at least prolongs the game and gives Black the chance to make a mistake (though with proper play, Black should win).

Therefore, the only legal move that doesn't lose immediately is:

```
a2b1
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/qn6/8/1K6 b - - 9 120

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a3), Bishop (b7), King (f7), Pawn (h7), Knight (b3)
- White: King (b1)

**White's king is on b1, boxed in by Black's knight on b3 and queen on a3. Black's bishop on b7 covers a8 and e4, and the queen dominates the a-file and third rank. The knight on b3 covers a1, a5, c1, and d2. The king on f7 is safe.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens mate with Qa1# if the king is on b1 and a1 is not covered.
- The knight on b3 covers c1 and a1, so the king cannot escape.
- White has no pieces, so no counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: This is check, but the king is already on b1, so this is mate.
2. **Other moves**: All other moves are unnecessary, as Qa1# is checkmate.

**Conclusion:** The best move is the immediate checkmate.

Legal moves in UCI notation: b1c2

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/1n6/8/qK6 w - - 10 121

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (White has king, Black has king+bishop+knight+pawn+queen)
2. White's king is very exposed on b1
3. Black has multiple threats including the queen on a1 and potential discovered checks
4. White's only legal move is b1c2 (king moves to c2)

Let's evaluate b1c2:
- Gets the king slightly away from immediate threats
- Still leaves the king exposed to potential discovered checks
- Doesn't solve the fundamental problem of being in a losing position

Unfortunately, White is in a completely lost position here. Black has too many active pieces and threats, while White has no counterplay. The best we can do is prolong the game, but there's no realistic chance to save it.

Given that b1c2 is the only legal move, we must play it, though it's just delaying the inevitable.

2025-06-11 22:33:43,481 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:33:48,442 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.96s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Bishop (b7), Knight (b3), King (f7), Pawn (h7)
- White: King (c2)

**Position:**
- White king is on c2, boxed in by Black's knight on b3 and bishop on b7.
- Black's queen is on a1, controlling the a-file and the long diagonal.
- Black's king is safe on f7.
- White has no pawns or pieces left.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can deliver checkmate if the White king is forced to the b-file and the queen can deliver mate.
- The White king has only two legal moves: c2-b3 (capturing the knight) or c2-d1.

**Candidate moves:**
- a1a2: Queen to a2, restricting the White king further.
- a1a4: Queen to a4, controlling the fourth rank.
- b3c5: Move knight, but then White king escapes to b3.
- b7c8: Bishop move, but not necessary.
- h7h6/h7h5: Pawn moves, not urgent.

**Check for forced mate:**
- If Black plays a1a2, the White king cannot move to b3 (knight guards), cannot move to d1 (queen guards), and cannot stay on c2 (queen attacks). That is checkmate.

**Double-check:**
- After a1a2, White king on c2:
    - b3 is guarded by knight.
    - d1 is guarded by queen.
    - c2 is attacked by queen.
    - No other squares to move.
- Therefore, a1a2 is checkmate.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
a1a2
```

Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/1n6/q1K5/8 w - - 12 122

Key features:
1. Material: White has only a king (Kc2), Black has queen (Qa2), knight (Nb3), bishop (Bb7), and pawn (h7)
2. King safety: White king is exposed, Black king is relatively safe
3. Immediate threats: Black has potential discovered checks with the knight
4. Pawn structure: Only Black has a pawn (h7) which could promote

Legal moves: c2d3, c2c3, c2d1

Let's evaluate each option:

1. c2d3:
   - Moves king towards center but closer to Black's pieces
   - Allows Qa2xd3 next move winning the king
   - Very dangerous

2. c2c3:
   - Puts king on same file as Black's queen
   - Allows Nb3xc3+ winning the king
   - Also dangerous

3. c2d1:
   - Moves king away from immediate threats
   - Keeps distance from Black's pieces
   - Best chance to prolong resistance

After c2d1, Black would likely play Qa2a1+ forcing Kd1c2, but this at least prevents immediate loss. The other moves lead to immediate checkmate or king capture.

Given the material disadvantage, White's best hope is to avoid immediate loss and hope Black makes a mistake. c2d1 is the only move that doesn't lose immediately.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/1n6/q7/3K4 b - - 13 122

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on f7, bishop on b7, knight on b3, queen on a2, pawn on h7
- White: King on d1

**White's king is on d1, boxed in by its own position and Black's pieces. Black has overwhelming material and total control. The White king has no escape squares.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's queen on a2 controls the second rank and a1-h1 diagonal.
- The knight on b3 controls d2 and c1.
- The bishop on b7 controls f3, e4, d5, c6, b7, a8.
- The king on f7 is safe.

**Goal:** Deliver checkmate or force White into zugzwang with no escape.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the White king to c2 (the only legal move).
2. **Qd2+**: Not possible, as the queen is on a2.
3. **Ba6**: Not a check, but could reposition the bishop.
4. **Nd4**: Not a check, but could reposition the knight.
5. **Ba8**: Not a check, but could reposition the bishop.
6. **Qa4**: Not a check, but could reposition the queen.

**Check for mate in 1:**
- **Qa1+**: King must go to c2.
- After that, Black can continue with Qa2+, and the king must return to d1, repeating the position.

**Check for mate in 2:**
- Is there a way to deliver mate in 2?
- **Qa1+ Kc2 Qa2+ Kd1** (repeats).
- **Nd4**: Not a check, but after that, the king still has no escape.
- **Ba6**: Not a check, but doesn't change the situation.

**Is there a forced mate?**
- If Black plays **Nd4**, then the White king is still stuck, but it's not a check.
- If Black plays **Qa1+**, it's a check, but not mate.

**Is there a zugzwang or a way to force mate?**
- Black can play **Nd4**. Now, the White king is still stuck on d1, and the knight covers c2 and f3. The queen on a2 covers the second rank and a1-h1 diagonal. The bishop on b7 covers e4.

**Let's check the king's escape squares after Nd4:**
- c1: covered by knight on d4
- c2: covered by queen on a2
- e1: covered by queen on a2
- e2: covered by queen on a2
- d2: covered by knight on d4

So after **Nd4**, the White king is completely boxed in and cannot move. But it's not checkmate, as it's not in check.

**Is there a forced mate with the queen and knight?**
- **Qa1+ Kc2 Qa2+ Kd1** repeats.
- **Qa4**: Not a check, but doesn't help.

**What about Ba6?**
- Not a check, doesn't help.

**What about h6?**
- Not relevant.

**What about moving the king?**
- Not relevant.

**What about moving the knight to d4?**
- It restricts the king further.

**What about moving the queen to a1?**
- Qa1+ Kc2 Qa2+ Kd1 repeats.

**Is there a way to bring the bishop to a more useful square?**
- Ba8, Ba6, Bc8, etc., but none deliver checkmate.

**Conclusion:**
- There is no immediate mate in 1.
- The best move is to play **Qa1+**, keeping the king boxed in and forcing it to c2, after which Black can continue to press for mate.

**Final move:**
```
qa1

2025-06-11 22:34:33,902 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.70s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/3n4/8/q7/3K4 w - - 14 123

This is a desperate position for White. The material count is:
- White: King only
- Black: Queen, Bishop, Knight, and pawn

Key observations:
1. White is in a completely lost position material-wise
2. Black has multiple mating threats
3. White's king is very restricted
4. Black's pieces are all active and coordinated

Our legal moves are only d1e1 or d1c1. Let's examine both:

1. d1e1:
- Black can play qa1# (queen to a1 checkmate)
- Or qb1# (queen to b1 checkmate)
- Or even qe2# (queen to e2 checkmate)
All lead to immediate checkmate

2. d1c1:
- This might delay mate by one move
- Black can still play qa1+ forcing the king back to d1
- Then qb1# is still possible
- Or black could play qxc1# immediately

After careful consideration, d1c1 at least forces black to make one more move to deliver checkmate, while d1e1 allows immediate mate. In completely lost positions, it's proper chess etiquette to make the opponent demonstrate the mate.

Therefore, the best move in this hopeless position is:

```
d1c1
```

**White's king is on c1, boxed in by its own pieces and Black's pieces. Black has overwhelming material and a king that is very far away from any danger.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black's queen on a2 is cutting off the c2 and b1 squares.
- The knight on d4 controls c2 and b3.
- The bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- The king on f7 is safe.
- White's king has no escape squares.

**Checkmate threats:**
- Let's look for forced mates or ways to restrict the White king further.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the White king to b2 (the only move).
2. **Nb3+**: If the king is on c1, this is mate, but currently, the queen is on a2.
3. **Qb2+**: Not possible, as the queen is on a2.
4. **Ne2+**: Not useful.
5. **Ba6**: Not a check, but could help in some lines.
6. **Qb3**: Not a check, but increases pressure.

But let's check the forced lines:

**If 1...Qa1+ 2.Kc2 (only move), then?**
- 2...Be4+ (bishop moves to e4, checking the king)
- 3.Kb3 (only move), then Qb1+ is mate.

But let's check the move order:

1. ... Qa1+  
   2. Kc2 (only move)  
   2. ... Be4+  
   3. Kb3 (only move)  
   3. ... Qb1+  
   4. Ka3 (only move)  
   4. ... Qb3# (mate)

But wait, after 1...Qa1+ 2.Kc2, is Be4+ possible? Let's check the squares:

- After Kc2, Be4+ is possible.
- Kb3 is the only move.
- Qb1+ is mate, as the king cannot go to a4 (covered by bishop), nor b4 (covered by queen), nor a2 (covered by queen), nor c4 (covered by bishop).

But let's check if there's a faster mate.

**Is there a mate in one?**
- Nb3# is not possible, as the queen is on a2.
- Qc2# is not possible, as the king is on c1.

**Is there a mate in two?**
- Qa1+ Kc2 Be4+ Kb3 Qb1+ Ka3 Qb3#

So, the fastest mate is to play:
```
qa1+
```
This starts a forced mate sequence.

Legal moves in UCI notation: c1d2

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-11 22:35:01,483 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.91s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/3n4/8/8/q1K5 w - - 16 124

Key features of the position:
1. Material: White has only a king (Kc1), Black has queen (Qa1), bishop (Bb7), knight (Nd4), and pawn (h7)
2. King safety: White king is exposed, Black king is relatively safe
3. Immediate threats: Black has multiple mating threats, especially Qa1-a2#
4. Our only legal move is Kc1-d2

Let's examine Kd2:
- After Kd2, Black has several dangerous continuations:
  - Qa1-b2+ (forking king and knight)
  - Qa1-a2+ (with ideas of Qa2-b1#)
  - Nd4-c2 (forking king and queen)
  
The position appears completely lost for White as Black can force mate in a few moves regardless of our response. For example:
1. Kd2 Qa2+ 
2. Kd1 (or Kc1 Qb1#) Qb1+ 
3. Kd2 Qb2+ 
4. Kd1 Qc1#

Since we're forced to move the king and all possible moves lead to immediate mate, we have no choice but to play the only legal move available.

Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Bishop (b7), Knight (d4), King (f7), Pawn (h7)
- White: King (d2)

**White's king is exposed and cut off. Black's queen, bishop, and knight coordinate well.**

**Immediate threats:**
- Black threatens mate with ...Qa2+ or ...Nb3+.
- White has no counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa2+**: Forces the king to c3 or e3 (if c3, then Ne2# is mate).
2. **Nb3+**: King must go to c3, then Qa1+ and mate follows.
3. **Nf3+**: King must go to e3, then Qd4# is mate.
4. **Qb2+**: King to e3, then Qe2# is mate.

Let's check **Qa2+**:
- 1...Qa2+ 2.Ke3 (only move), then Qe2# is mate.

Let's check **Nb3+**:
- 1...Nb3+ 2.Kc3 (only move), then Qa1+ 3.Kb4 Qa4# is mate.

But **Qa2+** is immediate and forces mate in one after Ke3.

**Final Move:**

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```

Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/3n4/8/q2K4/8 w - - 18 125

Key features of the position:
1. Material: White has only a king (Kd2), Black has queen (Qa2), bishop (Bb7), knight (Nd4), and pawn (h7)
2. King safety: White's king is exposed, Black's king is relatively safe
3. Immediate threats: Black's knight on d4 is attacking White's king
4. Possible checks: Black can deliver check with Qa2-a1 or Qa2-b2 next move

Legal moves for White:
- d2e3: moves towards center but into knight's attack
- d2d3: stays on same file as queen
- d2c3: moves away from threats but towards bishop's diagonal
- d2e1: moves towards corner
- d2d1: moves back
- d2c1: moves towards corner

Best defensive move appears to be d2c1 because:
1. It moves away from both the knight's attack and queen's potential checks
2. It doesn't walk into any immediate discovered attacks
3. It keeps options to move to b1 if needed
4. Other moves either walk into attacks or stay in dangerous positions

While the position is clearly losing for White, d2c1 offers the most resistance by minimizing immediate threats.

```

2025-06-11 22:35:31,645 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: Queen (a2), Bishop (b7), Knight (d4), King (f7), Pawn (h7)  
- White: King (c1)  

**Position:**  
- White's king is on c1, boxed in by its own position and Black's pieces.
- Black's queen on a2, knight on d4, bishop on b7, king on f7, pawn on h7.
- White has no pieces left, only the king.

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black is completely winning. The only concern is to avoid stalemate.

**Stalemate check:**  
- White's king on c1 has squares: b1, b2, c2, d1, d2, d3, c3, b3.
- But Black's knight on d4 covers b3, c2, e2, f3, f5, e6, c6, b5.
- Black's queen on a2 covers b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2, a1, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, b3, c4, d5, e6, f7, g8.
- Black's bishop on b7 covers c8, d7, e6, f5, g4, h3, a8, a6, c6, d5, e4, f3, g2, h1.

**Legal moves:**  
- Black has many moves, but the most forcing way is to checkmate or restrict the king further.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qa1+**: Forces the king to b2 or c2. But after Kd2, the king escapes a bit.
2. **Qa3**: No check, but keeps control.
3. **Ne2+**: This is a check. If Kd1, then Nc3+ wins the king.
4. **Nb3+**: This is a check. If Kd1, then Nc3+.
5. **Qa1**: No check, but threatens mate.
6. **Ba6**: No check, but restricts king.

But let's check for mate in 1 or 2.

**Check for mate in 1:**
- **Qa1+**: White can play Kd2, not mate.
- **Ne2+**: White can play Kd1, not mate.
- **Nb3+**: White can play Kd1, not mate.

**Check for mate in 2:**
- **Qa1+ Kd2 Qa2**: King has to go back to c1.
- **Qa1+ Kd2 Qd1#**: Let's check this line.
    - 1...Qa1+ 2.Kd2 Qd1# (Yes, this is mate, since the knight covers e2 and b3, bishop covers e4, queen covers all other squares.)

So, the move is:

```
a2a1
```

This is the most forcing move, leading to mate next move.

Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/3n4/8/8/q1K5 w - - 20 126

Key features of the position:
1. Material: White has just a king (Kc1), Black has queen (Qa1), bishop (Bb7), knight (Nd4), and pawn (h7)
2. King safety: White's king is exposed, Black's king is relatively safe
3. Immediate threats: Black has multiple mating threats, especially Qa1-a2 mate
4. White's only legal move is Kc1-d2

The position is completely lost for White. Black has overwhelming material advantage and multiple ways to deliver checkmate. The only move available (Kd2) doesn't prevent any of Black's mating threats.

For example, after 1. Kd2, Black can play:
- 1...Qa2+ 2. Ke3 Qe2#
- Or 1...Qb1 2. Ke2 Qe1#
- Or other immediate mating sequences

Since the position is completely hopeless and any move leads to immediate mate, the only proper move is to resign. However, since we must provide a move in UCI notation, I'll give the only legal move available:

```
c1d2
```

(Note: In a real game, I would resign in this position as it's completely lost with no counterplay possible)

2025-06-11 22:35:52,640 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.37s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**FEN:** 8/1b3k1p/8/8/3n4/8/3K4/q7 b - - 21 126

**Black:** King on f7, Queen on a1, Bishop on b7, Knight on d4, Pawn on h7  
**White:** King on d2

It's Black to move.

**Material:**  
Black has a queen, bishop, knight, pawn, and king.  
White has only a king.

**Objective:**  
Checkmate White as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Key Points:**
- White's king is on d2, with escape squares: c1, c2, c3, d1, d3, e1, e2, e3.
- Black's knight on d4 controls c2, e2, f3, f5, e6, c6, b5, b3.
- Black's queen on a1 can check on a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, b2, c3, d4, e5, f6, g7, h8.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- Black's king is on f7, far from the action.
- Black's pawn on h7 is irrelevant for now.

**Immediate Checks:**
- Qa2+ (forces White king to c1 or e1)
- Nb3+ (forces White king to c2 or e1)
- Nf3+ (forces White king to d1 or e2)
- Nf5+ (forces White king to e2 or d3)

But let's look for forced mates or ways to restrict the White king.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. Qa2+ (forces Kc1 or Ke1)
2. Nb3+ (forces Kc2 or e1)
3. Nf3+ (forces Kd1 or e2)
4. Nf5+ (forces Ke2 or d3)
5. Bxe4 (removes a defender, but not urgent)
6. h5/h6 (irrelevant)

**Let's analyze Qa2+:**
- 1...Qa2+ 2.Ke1 (if 2.Kc1, then Qa1# is mate)
- 2.Ke1 (now what? Nf3+ forces Kd1, then Qd2# is mate)

Let's check this line:
1...Qa2+ 2.Ke1 Nf3+ 3.Kd1 Qd2#

Is that mate?
- After 3...Qd2#, White's king is on d1, squares c1, e1, c2, e2 are all covered by Black's pieces.

Alternatively, after 1...Qa2+ 2.Kc1 Qa1# is mate.

**So, 1...Qa2+ is a forced mate in 2 or 3.**

**Double-check for stalemate:**
- After 1...Qa2+ 2.Ke1 Nf3+ 3.Kd1 Qd2#, White is mated.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
a1a2
```

2025-06-11 22:36:07,057 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 14.05s):
Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/3n4/8/q2K4/8 w - - 22 127

Key features:
1. Material: White has only a king (Kd2). Black has queen (Qa2), knight (Nd4), bishop (Bb7), and pawn (h7).
2. King safety: White's king is exposed and vulnerable to checks.
3. Immediate threats: Black's queen is attacking White's king from a2, and the knight on d4 controls many squares.

Legal moves for White's king:
- d2e3: moves towards center but into queen's control
- d2d3: stays on d-file but still in queen's range
- d2c3: moves away from queen but towards black's pieces
- d2e1: moves back but still in danger
- d2d1: similar to e1
- d2c1: moves towards corner but may be more dangerous

Best option seems d2c1 because:
1. It moves the king away from the queen's direct line of attack
2. It's harder for black to deliver immediate checkmate from this position
3. It keeps some flexibility to move to b1 if needed
4. Other moves either stay in queen's range or move towards black's pieces

While the position is clearly lost for White, d2c1 prolongs the game the most and gives the best chance for a potential stalemate opportunity if Black makes a mistake.

2025-06-11 22:36:12,075 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.72s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: Queen (a2), Bishop (b7), Knight (d4), King (f7), Pawn (h7)
- White: King (c1)

**White's king is on c1, boxed in by Black's pieces and the queen on a2. Black's knight on d4 controls key escape squares (b3, c2, e2), the bishop on b7 covers c8, and the queen on a2 is menacing. Black's king is safe on f7.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black can try to deliver mate or force the White king into a mating net.
- White has no pieces and cannot threaten Black.

**Candidate moves:**  
- a2c2: Queen to c2, check, but the king can take on c2.
- a2a1: Queen to a1, but this doesn't threaten anything.
- d4b3+: Knight to b3, check. If K moves to b1, then Qb2# is mate.
- d4e2+: Knight to e2, check. King has to go to d1 or b1.
- b7c8: Bishop move, but not threatening.
- h7h6: Pawn move, not relevant.

**Let's check d4b3+:**
- 1...Nd4-b3+ 2.Kc1xb3 (only move)
- Then Qb2# is mate.

**So, 1...Nb3+ is a forced mate in 1.**

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d4b3
```

2025-06-11 22:36:27,323 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 15.02s):
Let me analyze the position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/1n6/q7/2K5 w - - 24 128

Key observations:
1. Material is equal (White has king, Black has king+bishop+knight+pawn)
2. Black has a passed pawn on h7 that is close to promotion
3. White's king is somewhat exposed
4. Black has threats with queen checks and potential discovered attacks
5. The only legal move is c1d1 (King moves from c1 to d1)

This is a desperate situation for White. Let's evaluate the consequences of c1d1:

After c1d1:
- Black can play Qa1+ (queen check)
- Then White must move to d2 (only safe square)
- Black can then play Nc1+ (knight check)
- White must take the knight with Kxc1
- Then Black plays Qa1+ again
- White must go to Kd2
- Then Black can play Qb2+ with a discovered check from the bishop
- This leads to mate or massive material loss

Alternative lines after c1d1 also seem to lead to mate or loss of material. Unfortunately, White is in a completely lost position with no saving moves.

Since c1d1 is the only legal move and all variations lead to mate or material loss, we must play it despite the inevitable outcome.

2025-06-11 22:36:33,275 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.73s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black: King on f7, Bishop on b7, Knight on b3, Queen on a2, Pawn on h7
- White: King on d1

**Material:** Black is up a queen, bishop, knight, and pawn vs. lone king.

**Immediate threats:** Black has overwhelming material and White has only a king. The goal is to checkmate as efficiently as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Queen moves: a2-a1+, a2-a3, a2-a4, etc.
- Bishop moves: b7-c8, b7-a8, b7-c6, etc.
- Knight moves: b3-c5, b3-a5, b3-d4, etc.
- King moves: f7-g8, f7-f8, etc.
- Pawn moves: h7-h6, h7-h5

**Checkmate patterns:** With queen, bishop, and knight, mate should be straightforward. The White king is on d1, so let's look for forced mates or ways to restrict the king.

**Direct checks:**
- Qa1+ forces the king to c2 or e2 (since c1 is covered by the knight, e1 is covered by the queen, c2 is the only legal move).
- After Qa1+ Kc2, then ...Be4+ is mate (since b1, c1, d1, d3, b3, and b2 are all covered).

Let's verify this:

1. ... Qa1+  
2. Kc2 (only move)  
3. Be4# (bishop covers d3, queen covers b2, knight covers b3 and c1, king covers d1, so all escape squares are covered)

**Conclusion:** This is a forced mate in two.

**Final move:**
```
a2a1

2025-06-11 22:36:51,015 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 17.50s):
Let me analyze this critical endgame position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/1n6/8/q2K4 w - - 26 129

Key features:
1. Material: White has only a king (Kd1), Black has queen (Qa1), knight (Nb3), bishop (Bb7), and pawn (h7)
2. King safety: Both kings are exposed
3. Immediate threats: Black's queen controls many squares around white's king
4. Legal moves: Kd1-e2 or Kd1-c2

Let's evaluate both options:

1. Kd1-e2:
- Moves king towards center but closer to black's pieces
- Black can respond with Qa1xe2+ winning the king
- This is actually forced mate: 1...Qxe2+ 2.Kxe2 Bc6+ 3.K moves Nxd4+ etc.

2. Kd1-c2:
- Moves king away from immediate threats
- Creates potential for opposition against black's king
- After 1.Kc2, black has several options but no immediate forced win
- Best try might be 1...Qa2+ 2.Kc1 Qa1+ (repetition) or 2...Bb6 trying to coordinate pieces

The key realization is that Kd1-e2 leads to immediate forced mate, while Kd1-c2 offers some resistance. Black has overwhelming material advantage and can eventually coordinate their pieces to deliver mate, but Kc2 makes it more difficult.

Given the absolute urgency and critical nature of the position, I must choose the move that prolongs resistance as much as possible:

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:

2025-06-11 22:36:57,315 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.00s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**
- Black: Queen (a1), Bishop (b7), Knight (b3), King (f7), Pawn (h7)
- White: King (c2)

**Position:**
- White's king is on c2, boxed in by Black's knight on b3 and queen on a1.
- Black's bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.
- Black's queen on a1 is extremely powerful, cutting off escape squares.
- Black's knight on b3 covers a lot of squares around the White king.
- Black's king is safe on f7.
- White has no pieces except the king.

**Immediate threats:**
- Black can checkmate if the White king is forced to b1 or c1, as the queen and knight cover those squares.
- Black must avoid stalemate. If the White king cannot move and is not in check, it's a draw.

**Candidate moves:**
1. a1a2+ (Queen check)
   - White must play Kd1 or Kb1.
2. a1a4 (Queen move, not a check, but keeps pressure)
3. b3d4+ (Knight check)
   - White must play Kd3 or Kd1.
4. h7h6/h7h5 (pawn moves, not urgent)
5. f7g8/f7f8/etc. (king moves, not urgent)

**Best move?**
- Let's check a1a2+:
    - If 1...Qa2+ 2.Kd1 (only move), then Black can play Qb1# (mate).
    - If 1...Qa2+ 2.Kb1, then Black can play Nd2+ and after Kc1, Qb1#.
    - But after 2.Kd1, Qb1# is mate.

So, **a1a2+** leads to forced mate.

**Double-check for stalemate:**
- After Qa2+, White has legal moves, so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to play **a1a2+**, which forces mate next move.

Final answer:
```
a1a2
```

2025-06-11 22:37:14,472 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3) (took 16.87s):
Let me analyze this position carefully.

Current FEN: 8/1b3k1p/8/8/8/1n6/q1K5/8 w - - 28 130

Key features of the position:
1. White king is at c2, Black king at f7
2. Black has:
   - Queen at a2
   - Knight at b3
   - Bishop at b7
   - Pawn at h7
3. White has only the king
4. Material is heavily in Black's favor (Queen+Bishop+Knight vs bare King)
5. Black's pieces are very active and coordinated
6. White is in a desperate situation with only 3 legal king moves

Let's examine each legal move:

1. c2d3:
   - Moves king towards center but into potential attack
   - Black can play Qb2+ winning immediately
   - Or Nb4+ forking king and queen
   - Very dangerous

2. c2c3:
   - Moves king towards Black's queen
   - Black can play Qa1+ forcing king back
   - Or Nb4+ forking
   - Doesn't improve position

3. c2d1:
   - Moves king away from immediate threats
   - Potentially the safest option
   - Black would need to find a way to continue the attack
   - Might prolong resistance

Given the material deficit and Black's coordinated pieces, the position is objectively lost for White. The best we can hope for is to prolong the game and hope for a mistake.

After careful consideration, c2d1 appears to be the most resilient move, as it removes the king from immediate checks and forks. While the position remains lost, this move makes Black work harder to demonstrate the win.

Legal moves in UCI notation: f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7, f7g6, f7f6, f7e6, b7c8, b7a8, b7c6, b7a6, b7d5, b7e4, b7f3, b7g2, b7h1, b3c5, b3a5, b3d4, b3d2, b3c1, b3a1, a2a8, a2a7, a2a6, a2a5, a2a4, a2a3, a2h2, a2g2, a2f2, a2e2, a2d2, a2c2, a2b2, a2b1, a2a1, h7h6, h7h5

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-06-11 22:37:14,705 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-11 22:37:21,135 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.43s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: Queen (a2), Bishop (b7), Knight (b3), King (f7), Pawn (h7)
- White: King (d1)

**White's king is on d1, boxed in by its own position and Black's pieces. Black's queen is on a2, bishop on b7, knight on b3, king on f7, pawn on h7.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- Black is completely winning. White has only the king, and Black has overwhelming material.
- The White king is nearly mated, with very few escape squares.

**Candidate moves:**  
- Look for forced mate or a move that restricts the White king further.
- Queen moves: a2-d2 is check and forces the White king to c1 or e1 (but e1 is covered by the bishop).
- Knight moves: b3-d4/c5/d2/c1/a1 (but none are check).
- Bishop moves: b7-c8/a8/c6/a6/d5/e4/f3/g2/h1 (none are check).
- King moves: f7-g8/f8/e8/g7/e7/g6/f6/e6 (not relevant for mate).
- Pawn moves: h7-h6/h5 (not relevant for mate).

**Check for mate in 1:**  
- Qa2-d2+ forces Kc1 (as e1 is covered by bishop), then Qd2-c1# is mate.
- But let's check if Qd2 is mate immediately:  
  - Qd2+ K moves to c1 only (e1 is covered by bishop), then Qc1# is mate.

**Is there a mate in 1?**  
- Qd2+ is not mate, but after Kc1, Qc1# is mate.

**Is there a mate in 2?**  
- Yes, Qd2+ Kc1 Qc1#.

**Is there a mate in 1 with another move?**  
- Qb2 is not check.
- Qb1 is not check.
- Qc2 is not check.
- Qc4 is not check.
- Qd5 is not check.
- Qe6 is not check.
- Qf7 is not check.
- Qg8 is not check.
- Qh1 is not check.

**Any knight move is not check.**

**Any bishop move is not check.**

**Therefore, the best move is Qd2+, forcing mate next move.**

So, the best move is:
```
a2d2
```
