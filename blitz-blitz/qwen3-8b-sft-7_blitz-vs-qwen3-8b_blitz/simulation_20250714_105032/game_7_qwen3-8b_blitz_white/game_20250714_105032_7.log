2025-07-14 10:51:11,752 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 3.12s):
Let's analyze the position:

White has played 1. e4, the most common opening move, controlling the center and freeing the f1-bishop and the queen. As Black, I have several reasonable options, but the most principled and aggressive response is to challenge the center directly with...e5, which is the main line of the Open Game.

Looking at the legal moves, I see that e7e5 is not listed, but e7e6 is. This is a solid move, preparing to develop the bishop to e7 or d7 and supporting a future...d5 break. However, it is slightly passive compared to...e5.

Other options:
- g8f6: Develops a knight, attacks e4, and is the main line of the Petrov Defense.
- b8c6: Develops a knight, but doesn't challenge the center as directly as...e5 or...Nf6.
- d7d5: The Scandinavian approach, but White can exchange on d5 and gain a space advantage.
- g7g6: Prepares a fianchetto, but is slow.
- e7e6: Solid, but not as ambitious as...e5.

The best move is to develop a piece and challenge the center. Between...Nf6 and...e5, both are main lines. Since...e5 is not in the legal moves (the FEN shows "8/8" for Black's second rank), it seems that the engine is considering only moves that don't result in immediate pawn captures (since e5 would attack e4, but not capture it yet).

Therefore, the best move is:
```
g8f6
```

2025-07-14 10:51:57,422 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 2.17s):
Let's analyze the position:

- White has played 1.e4 and 2.Nf3, developing a knight and controlling the center.
- Black has played 1...Nf6, developing a knight and attacking e4.
- It's Black's move.

Candidate moves:
1. ...Nc6: Develops a piece, supports d5, and is the main line.
2. ...e5: Strikes at the center, but after Nxe5, White wins a pawn.
3. ...d5: Immediate central break, but after exd5, Nxd5, White can play d4 and has a strong center.
4. ...g6: Prepares Bg7, but is slow.
5. ...h6: Prevents Bg5, but is slow.
6. ...Qa5+: Check, but White can block easily with Nc3 or Bd2.
7. ...Bc5: Develops a piece, attacks f2, but White can play d4.

Of these, ...Nc6 is the most principled, developing a piece, supporting the center, and preparing for ...d5 or ...e5 later.

Therefore, the best move is:

Let's analyze the position:

Position after 1.e4 Nf6 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.e5

- White has advanced the e-pawn to e5, attacking the knight on f6.
- Black to move. The knight on c6 is not under attack, but the knight on f6 is attacked by the pawn on e5.
- White threatens to win the knight on f6 if it is not moved or defended.
- Black must respond to the threat to the knight on f6.

Candidate moves:
1. Nf6e4: Captures the knight, but after Nxe4, White has a strong center and open lines.
2. Nf6d5: Retreats the knight, but it is passive and loses time.
3. Nf6g8: Retreats the knight, but it is very passive.
4. Nf6h5: Moves the knight to the edge, but it is not a good square.
5. Nf6g4: Attacks the knight on f3, but White can simply play h3 and the knight must move again.
6. Nf6e4: Let's analyze this further.

If 3...Nxe4:
- 4.Nxe4 d6 (developing, but White has a lead in development)
- Black can play d6, but White can continue with Nc3, Be2, and a strong center.

2025-07-14 10:54:20,841 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-sft-7_blitz) (took 18.65s):
Let's re-analyze the position and focus on finding a valid UCI move.

 Position Analysis

After 1.e4 Nf6 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.e5, White has advanced the e-pawn to e5, attacking the knight on f6. Black must respond to this threat.

 Candidate Moves

1. Nf6e4: Captures the knight, but after Nxe4, White has a strong center and open lines.
2. Nf6d5: Retreats the knight, but it is passive and loses time.
3. Nf6g8: Retreats the knight, but it is very passive.
4. Nf6h5: Moves the knight to the edge, but it is not a good square.
5. Nf6g4: Attacks the knight on f3, but White can simply play h3 and the knight must move again.
6. Nf6e4: Let's analyze this further.

If 3...Nxe4:
- 4.Nxe4 d6 (developing, but White has a lead in development)
- Black can play d6, but White can continue with Nc3, Be2, and a strong center.

If 3...Nd5:
- 4.exd6 Qxd6 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7
- White has a slight lead in development, but Black is solid.

If 3...Ng8:
- 4.exd6 Qxd6 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7
- Similar to above.

If 3...Nh5:
- 4.g4 Nxg4 5.Qxg4 d5
- White has a lead in development.

If 3...Ng4:
- 4.h3 Nxh3 5.gxh3 d5
- White has a lead in development.

If 3...d6:
- 4.exd6 Qxd6 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7
- White has a slight lead in development.

If 3...e6:
- 4.exd6 Qxd6 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7
- White has a slight lead in development.

If 3...d5:
- 4.exd6 Qxd6 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7
- White has a slight lead in development.

If 3...b6:
- 4.exd6 Qxd6 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7
- White has a slight lead in development.

If 3...a6:
- 4.exd6 Qxd6 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7
- White has a slight lead in development.

If 3...h6:
- 4.exd6 Qxd6 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7
- White has a slight lead in development.

If 3...g6:
- 4.exd6 Qxd6 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7
