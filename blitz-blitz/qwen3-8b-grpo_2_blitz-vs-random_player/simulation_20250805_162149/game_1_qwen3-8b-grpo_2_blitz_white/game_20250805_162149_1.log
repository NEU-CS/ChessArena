You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-05 16:22:06,457 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 2.06s):
Let's analyze the position:

1. The FEN shows the starting position (after 0 moves).
2. White has all pieces in their starting positions.
3. Black also has all pieces in their starting positions.
4. The legal moves listed are all the possible first moves for White.

Evaluation:
- The most common and strongest first move is e2e4 (Pawn to e4)
- This move:
  - Controls the center
  - Opens lines for the bishop and queen
  - Prepares for castling
  - Follows opening principles
- Other moves like d2d4 or f2f4 are also reasonable but less common
- Moves like g1f3 (Nf3) or b1c3 (Nc3) are good developing moves but usually played after pawn moves

Conclusion:
The best move is e2e4, the standard pawn opening move that follows all opening principles and prepares for further development.

```

2025-08-05 16:22:50,579 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 2.78s):
Let's analyze the position carefully:

1. The FEN shows White has a pawn on e4 (e4e5 is a legal move) and Black has a pawn on e6. This is a standard opening position with White having a slight space advantage.

2. White's pieces are all in their starting positions except the e-pawn. Black's pieces are also in starting positions except the e-pawn.

3. The legal moves show several options:
   - Knight moves (g1h3, g1f3)
   - Bishop moves (f1a6, f1b5, f1c4, f1d3)
   - Queen moves (d1h5, d1g4, d1f3, d1e2)
   - Pawn moves (e4e5, h2h3, g2g3, etc.)

4. The most principled move is e4e5 - this:
   - Opens the e-file for White's rook
   - Gains space in the center
   - Prepares potential e5-e6 pawn breaks
   - Follows opening principles of controlling the center

5. Other moves:
   - Knight moves (g1f3) are also good developing moves
   - Bishop moves (f1c4) are reasonable
   - But e4e5 is the most direct way to claim space in the center

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e4e5
```

Let's analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a pawn on e5, Black has pawns on b5, e6. Material is equal.

2. King safety: White's king is still in the center. Black's king is also in the center.

3. Piece development: White has no pieces developed yet. Black has a knight on b8 and bishop on f8.

4. Pawn structure: White's e-pawn is advanced to e5, creating a passed pawn. Black has pawns on b5 and e6.

5. Candidate moves:
- d2d4: Central pawn push, opens lines for White's pieces
- f2f4: Gains space on kingside
- b1c3: Develops knight
- f1c4: Develops bishop to active square
- d1f3: Queen move, but seems too early

The most principled move is d2d4, which:
- Opens the center for White's pieces
- Supports the e5 pawn
- Prepares for castling
- Follows opening principles

Other moves either don't develop pieces or create weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:

```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.
