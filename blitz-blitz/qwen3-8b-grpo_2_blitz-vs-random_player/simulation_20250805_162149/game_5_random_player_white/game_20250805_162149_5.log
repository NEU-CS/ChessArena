You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-05 16:22:40,922 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 2.05s):
Let's analyze the position carefully:

1. The FEN shows it's Black's move (indicated by 'b' in the FEN)
2. White has a knight on h3 (unusual placement)
3. Black's pieces are in their starting positions
4. White's king is still on e1 (not castled yet)
5. The legal moves show Black has several options, mostly pawn moves and knight developments

Key considerations:
- White's knight on h3 is slightly exposed
- Black should develop pieces while maintaining control
- The most natural developing move is Nf6 (g8f6), which:
  - Develops the knight to its most active square
  - Protects e4 pawn
  - Prepares potential castling
  - Doesn't weaken any pawns

Other options:
- e7e5 would be a good central pawn push
- d7d5 is also a solid central option
- But Nf6 is the most immediate developing move

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8f6
```

2025-08-05 16:23:45,266 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 2.61s):
Let's analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Black is down a knight for a pawn (White has knight on h3, Black has knight on f6). Material is roughly equal.

2. King safety: Both kings are in their starting positions.

3. Piece activity: White's knight on h3 is well-placed. Black's knight on f6 is also active.

4. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, b3, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2. Black has pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7.

5. Candidate moves:
- e7e5: Central pawn push, gains space
- d7d5: Another central pawn push
- Nc6: Develops the knight
- Nh5: Moves knight to h5
- g7g5: Pawn push to gain space

The most principled move is e7e5, the King's Pawn Opening. This:
- Gains central control
- Opens lines for Black's bishop
- Prepares possible e5-e4 push
- Maintains flexibility

Other moves:
- d7d5 is also good but less flexible
- Nc6 is too slow
- Nh5 doesn't accomplish much
- g7g5 weakens pawns

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e7e5
```
