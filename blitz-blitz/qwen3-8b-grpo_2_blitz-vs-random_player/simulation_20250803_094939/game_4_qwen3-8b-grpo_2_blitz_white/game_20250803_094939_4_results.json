Current position: This is the starting position of a chess game (FEN shows it's White's turn to move).\n\n2. Key considerations for opening moves:\n   - Control the center (e4, d4, e5, d5)\n   - Develop knights before bishops\n   - Avoid moving the same piece multiple times\n   - Consider king safety (castling rights are still available)\n\n3. Evaluating candidate moves:\n   - g1h3/g1f3: Developing the knight to f3 is standard and controls center\n   - b1c3/b1a3: c3 is better as it controls more central squares\n   - h2h3/h2h4: These are passive pawn moves with no immediate benefit\n   - g2g3/g2g4: Similar to h-pawn moves, not very useful yet\n   - f2f3: Weakens e3 square\n   - e2e3: Blocks bishop development\n   - d2d3: Blocks bishop development\n   - c2c3: Controls d4 but not as active as other moves\n   - b2b3: Doesn't accomplish much\n   - a2a3: Very passive\n\n4. Best moves seem to be:\n   - g1f3 (develops knight to active square)\n   - b1c3 (develops knight to central square)\n   - e2e4 (claims center immediately)\n\nBetween these, e2e4 is most principled as it:\n- Claims the center\n- Opens lines for the bishop\n- Is the most aggressive move\n- Leads to typical opening positions\n\n```\ne2e4\n```",

Black has played ...Nf6 and ...g5, while White has developed the bishop to c4.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's king is still in the center\n   - White has a bishop on c4 eyeing f7\n   - Black's pawn on g5 is slightly weak\n   - White has several developing moves available\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - c4f7: Bishop sacrifice on f7 - tempting but Black can defend with ...Qe7\n   - g1f3: Developing knight with tempo on the pinned g5 pawn\n   - d1h5: Queen move attacking g5 pawn\n   - e4e5: Pushing pawn to gain space\n\n4. Best move seems to be g1f3 because:\n   - Develops a piece\n   - Attacks the pinned g5 pawn\n   - If Black takes the knight (Nxf3), White can play Qh5+ winning the pawn\n   - If Black doesn't take, White has a strong knight on f3\n   - Maintains all other options\n\nOther moves either don't develop pieces or don't take advantage of Black's pinned pawn. The knight move is the most forcing and active choice.\n\n```\ng1f3\n```",

Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6g8: Captures the rook, but allows Black to play ...Kxg8\n- f6h7: Checks the king, but Black can play ...Kxh7\n- c4e6: Attacks the bishop and threatens to win material\n- e1g1: Castles to safety and connects rooks\n\n4. Best move seems to be c4e6:\n- It attacks the pinned bishop on c3\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play Nxd7 winning the exchange\n- If Black plays ...Bxe6, then Nxd7 wins the rook on a8\n- It maintains all of White's threats while developing the initiative\n\nOther moves either don't capitalize on the pin or allow Black to escape the pin. c4e6 is the most forcing and winning move.\n\n```\nc4e6\n```",

Material is roughly equal (knight + rook vs queen, but White has an extra pawn).\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on h4, attacking g2 and h2\n- White's knight on g7 is threatening to capture the rook on h8\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has castling rights while Black doesn't\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7e8: Captures the rook but allows Qxg2\n- g7e6: Centralizes the knight but doesn't address the queen\n- e1g1: Castles and gets the king to safety\n- h1g1: Moves the rook but doesn't solve problems\n- e4e5: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1g1 (castling):\n- Gets the king to safety away from the queen's attacks\n- Connects the rooks\n- Maintains the threat of Nxe8\n- After castling, if Black takes g2 (Qxg2), White can play Nxe8 winning the exchange\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or miss opportunities. Castling is the most prudent move here.\n\n```\ne1g1\n```",

Candidate moves to consider:\n- g6h8: Captures the rook but allows Black to play Bxh8\n- g6e7: Centralizes the knight and threatens to jump to f5\n- c1h6: Attacks the a6 pawn and opens the c-file for the rook\n- e4e5: Advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n\n4.

Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7e8: Captures the bishop but allows Black to play ...a3, pushing the passed pawn\n- g7e6: Centralizes the knight but doesn't accomplish much\n- c1h6: Attacks the a5 rook but Black can defend\n- e4e5: Advances the pawn but blocks the bishop\n- a2a3: Stops the passed pawn but gives up the bishop pair\n\n4.

Material is roughly equal, but Black's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on e6 is very strong, attacking Black's king on d7\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n- Black's rook on a5 is eyeing the a-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6f8: Checks the king, but Black can just take the knight\n- e6d8: Checks the king, but Black can block with bishop\n- e6g7: Moves knight to safety while maintaining pressure\n- c1h6: Develops bishop with tempo on the rook\n- a1b1: Moves rook off the a-file\n\n4. Best move seems to be c1h6:\n- Develops the bishop with tempo (attacking the rook)\n- If Black takes the bishop (axh6), White can play e6f8+ winning the rook\n- If Black moves the rook, White can play e6f8+ winning the bishop\n- Maintains all of White's threats while improving piece coordination\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous move in the position.\n\n```\nc1h6\n```",

Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6f8: Bishop checks the king, but Black can block with ...Rd8\n- d4e6: Centralizes the knight and attacks the b5 pawn\n- d4f5: Attacks the h7 pawn and maintains central control\n- d5d6: Advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4e6 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the b5 pawn which is Black's main passed pawn\n- If Black takes the bishop with ...Bxe6, White can play dxe6 opening the d-file for the rook\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play dxe6 gaining a pawn\n- It maintains all of White's options while improving the knight\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. The bishop on h6 can wait as it's currently doing no harm.\n\n```\nd4e6\n```",

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on a7\n- White has a rook on e8 controlling the 8th rank\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- White's bishop on h6 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8h8: Rook lift to h8, threatening to swing to h7\n- h6f8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- e6f8: Knight moves to defend the rook\n- h4h5: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e8h8 because:\n- It prepares Rh7+, forcing the black king to move\n- After Kh7, White can play Bf8+ winning the rook on b8\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White gains time to push pawns or bring more pieces into attack\n- It maintains all threats while improving the rook's position\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. The rook lift is the most forcing and dangerous move.\n\n```\ne8h8\n```",

Best move seems to be h6g7:\n- It attacks the rook on f8\n- If Black takes the bishop (Kxf8), then Rg8+ wins the rook\n- If Black moves the rook, we can play d5d6 advancing our passed pawn\n- It maintains all of White's threats while improving the bishop's position\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow Black to consolidate. h6g7 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\nh6g7\n```",

Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7g8: Promotes the rook to queen, but not necessary yet\n- f6d8: Bishop check, but Black can just move the king\n- h4h8: Rook move, but doesn't accomplish much\n- b4b5: Advances the passed pawn\n- a2a4: Advances another passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be b4b5:\n- Creates an immediate passed pawn threat\n- Black can't stop both passed pawns (a and b)\n- Even if Black tries to capture the a-pawn, the b-pawn will queen\n- The rooks and bishop can handle any king movements\n\nThe move b4b5 is the most forcing and creates immediate winning threats.

Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Rook lift to potentially check the king\n- f4b8: Bishop move to control the b-pawn's path\n- g2g4: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn\n- b5b6: Advancing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be f4b8 because:\n- It directly controls the b5 pawn's advance\n- The bishop is very active on b8, eyeing the black king\n- It prevents Black from pushing b5-b4\n- It maintains all other options for White\n- It's a quiet move that improves piece placement\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or are too aggressive. The bishop move is both defensive and offensive.\n\n```\nf4b8\n```",

Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Rook check, but Black can just take the rook with Kxh8\n- c7f4: Bishop move attacking the king, but Black can play Kf6\n- g2g8: Rook move to g8, but doesn't accomplish much\n- b6b7: Pawn advance, but doesn't address the immediate position\n\n4. Best move seems to be d8d5:\n- Checks the king, forcing it to move\n- After Kf5-e4 (best response), White can play Bc7-d6+, winning the h2 pawn\n- Even if Black tries Kf5-f6, White can play Bc7-e5+ winning the a2 pawn\n- This maintains material advantage while eliminating Black's counterplay\n\nThe move d8d5 is the most forcing and leads to concrete advantages by winning Black's dangerous pawns.\n\n```\nd8d5\n```",

Why b6b7 is best:\n- Creates an immediate threat to promote\n- Black can't stop the pawn without giving up material (e.g. ...Kd7 allows Bf6+ winning the rook)\n- Even if Black tries ...Kf7, White can play Bf6+ winning the rook\n- The pawn is very close to promotion and Black has no way to stop it\n\nAll other moves either don't make progress or allow Black to defend.
