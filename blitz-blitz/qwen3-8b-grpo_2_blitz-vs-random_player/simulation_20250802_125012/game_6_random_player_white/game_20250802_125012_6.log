You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4

2025-08-02 12:50:51,951 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.96s):
Let's analyze the position:

The current FEN is: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1

This is the starting position after White has played c2-c3. Black has not yet moved any pieces.

Key factors to consider:
1. White has a slight space advantage with the c3 pawn.
2. Black's king is still in the starting position.
3. All pieces are still on their original squares.

Candidate moves:
1. g8h6 - Moves a knight to a less active position
2. g8f6 - Develops a knight to a natural position, controlling the center
3. b8c6 - Develops a knight and controls the center
4. b8a6 - Moves a knight to a less active position
5. h7h6 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
6. g7g6 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
7. f7f6 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
8. e7e6 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
9. d7d6 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
10. c7c6 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
11. b7b6 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
12. a7a6 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
13. h7h5 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
14. g7g5 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
15. f7f5 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
16. e7e5 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
17. d7d5 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
18. c7c5 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
19. b7b5 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
20. a7a5 - Creates space but doesn't develop pieces

Best move:
The most natural developing move is g8f6, which:
- Develops a knight to a central position
- Controls the center
- Prepares for future piece development
- Follows standard opening principles
- Is a move that will be useful in the long-term development of the position

Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8f6
```

2025-08-02 12:51:28,673 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 12:51:32,819 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.15s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material is equal, but White has a slight space advantage with pawns on c3, d3, e2, etc.

2. Key features:
   - White has a strong center with pawns on c3, d3, e2
   - Black's knight on f6 is well placed, but could be improved
   - White has potential to expand in the center later

3. Candidate moves:
   - h8g8: Moves the rook to a less active position
   - b8c6: Develops the knight to a natural position, controlling the center
   - b8a6: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6g8: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - h7h6: Creates a weakness
   - g7g6: Creates a weakness
   - e7e6: Solidifies the center
   - d7d6: Solidifies the center
   - c7c6: Solidifies the center
   - b7b6: Creates a weakness
   - a7a6: Creates a weakness
   - h7h5: Creates a weakness
   - g7g5: Creates a weakness
   - e7e5: Opens the center
   - d7d5: Opens the center
   - c7c5: Opens the center
   - b7b5: Opens the center
   - a7a5: Opens the center

4. Best move:
   The most natural and solid move is b8c6, developing the knight to control the center and prepare for future expansion. Other moves either don't develop pieces or create weaknesses. e7e6 is solid but doesn't develop pieces. h8g8 is passive. f6g8 is passive. h7h6 is passive.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b8c6
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 12:52:05,147 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.74s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material is equal, but White has a slight space advantage with pawns on c3, d3, e3, etc.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong center with pawns on c3, d3, e3
- Black's knight on c6 is well placed, but other pieces are still undeveloped
- White has the initiative and could soon play ...e5 to challenge the center

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- h8g8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f6g8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness
- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- e7e6: Solidifies the center
- d7d6: Solidifies the center
- b7b6: Creates a weakness
- a7a6: Creates a weakness
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- e7e5: Challenges the center
- d7d5: Challenges the center
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e7e6. This:
- Solidifies the center
- Prepares to challenge White's center later with ...e5
- Develops the bishop to f6, which is a natural developing move
- Maintains tension in the center
- Prevents White from gaining too much space

Other moves either don't develop pieces or create weaknesses. e7e6 is a solid, proactive move that maintains the initiative.

```
e7e6

1. Material is equal, but White has a slight space advantage with pawns on c3, d3, e3, etc.

- White has a strong center with pawns on c3, d3, e3
- Black's knight on c6 is well placed, but other pieces are still undeveloped
- White has the initiative and could soon play ...d5 or ...e5 to gain more space

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- h8g8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8e7: Develops the bishop and prepares to challenge the center
- f8d6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f8c5: Moves the bishop to a less active position

- f8a3: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e8e7: Moves the king to a less active position

- d7d6: Challenges the center
- b7b6: Creates a weakness
- a7a6: Creates a weakness
- e6e5: Challenges the center
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- d7d5: Challenges the center
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e7, developing the bishop to a natural position where it can challenge the center and prepare to castle soon. This is a solid, flexible move that improves piece activity and prepares to meet White's central pressure. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. d7d6 is tempting but doesn't develop pieces. e6e5 is too early and could lead to complications White can exploit.

After f8e7, Black can continue with ...d6, ...Nc6, ...O-O, and ...Re8, building a solid position to challenge White's center later.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e7
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8g8, moving the king to a more active position and preparing to castle, which will help defend the king and connect the rooks. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or create weaknesses. This is a standard developing move in the opening.

After e8g8, Black can proceed to develop other pieces and prepare to castle, which is a natural progression in the opening phase.

e8g8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 12:53:56,967 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.61s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have equal material, but White has slightly more space and activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d2, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential to play ...d5 soon to challenge the center

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8e8: Connects the rooks and prepares to castle
- d8e8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7d6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7c5: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7b4: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7a3: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position

- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness
- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- d7d6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- d7d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, connecting the rooks and preparing to castle kingside, which will:
- Move the queen to a less active position
- Connect the rooks
- Prepare to castle, getting the king to safety
- Allow the rook on f8 to become active later

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves the queen, which is less important than connecting the rooks.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have equal material, but White has slightly more activity with their pieces.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d7d6. This:
- Creates a small weakness in the center
- Prevents White from playing ...d5 later to challenge the center
- Allows the king to potentially move to d7 later for safety
- Maintains tension in the center, forcing White to make a decision
- Is a solid, prophylactic move that improves piece activity and king safety

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d7d6 is the only move that prevents a potential central break by White.

You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 12:55:24,014 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 12:55:30,393 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.38s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have equal material, but White has slightly more activity with their pieces.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on g3, controlling key squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a solid pawn structure and potential to develop pieces

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8d7: Moves the queen to a less active position
- c8d7: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6d7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness
- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- b7b6: Creates a weakness
- a7a6: Creates a weakness
- e6e5: Creates a weakness
- d6d5: Creates a weakness
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be c8d7, moving the bishop to a more active position where it can help defend the king and prepare for future development. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or create weaknesses. e8f8 is a slow move, but at least moves the king towards the action. d8d7 is a slow move, but at least moves the queen towards the action. a8b8 is a slow move, but at least moves the rook towards the action. c6b8 is a slow move, but at least moves the knight towards the action. c6e5 is a slow move, but at least moves the knight towards the action. c6a5 is a slow move, but at least moves the knight towards the action. c6d4 is a slow move, but at least moves the knight towards the action. c6b4 is a slow move, but at least moves the knight towards the action. h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, e6e5, d6d5, h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5 all create weaknesses.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c8d7
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a quiet move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

After e8f8, the king is safer and can later move to g7 or e7 to help defend the center. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 12:57:09,427 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.21s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity with their pieces.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a solid pawn structure and potential to expand later

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f8e8: Connects the rooks and prepares to castle
- d8e8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness
- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- b7b6: Creates a weakness
- a7a6: Creates a weakness
- e6e5: Creates a weakness
- d6d5: Creates a weakness
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, connecting the rooks and preparing to castle kingside later. This move:
- Improves the activity of the rook on f8
- Prepares to castle, getting the king to safety
- Maintains tension in the center
- Keeps pieces active and ready to participate in future action

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. h7h6, g7g6, etc. create weaknesses without improving piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

The most prudent move appears to be c6b8, moving the knight to a more active position where it can help defend the king and prepare for future central action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. d8c8 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. a8c8 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. h7h6 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. g7g6 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. b7b6 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. a7a6 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. e6e5 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. d6d5 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. h7h5 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. g7g5 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. b7b5 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. a7a5 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

2025-08-02 13:00:38,271 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.33s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more central control.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong center with pawns on c3, d3, e3, etc.
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has potential to develop pieces and increase pressure

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves bishop to a less active position
- b8c6: Develops the knight to a natural position, putting pressure on d4
- b8a6: Moves knight to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves bishop to a less active position
- d7c6: Develops the bishop to a natural position, putting pressure on d4
- d7b5: Moves bishop to a less active position
- d7a4: Moves bishop to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness
- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- c7c6: Develops the pawn structure and puts pressure on d4
- b7b6: Creates a weakness
- a7a6: Creates a weakness
- e6e5: Advances the pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- d6d5: Advances the pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- c7c5: Advances the pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most natural developing move that puts pressure on the center is b8c6. This moves the knight to a strong central position, putting pressure on the d4 pawn and preparing to develop other pieces later. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. c7c6 is also a reasonable move, but b8c6 is more proactive in development and central control.

After b8c6, Black can continue to develop pieces and prepare to castle soon, while White may try to increase pressure on the center. This is a solid, proactive move that fits with standard opening principles.

```
b8c6
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2. Key features:

- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential to play ...e5 soon to gain central control

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position

- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be c6b8, moving the knight to a more active position where it can help defend the king and prepare for future central action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or create weaknesses. e8f8 is tempting but doesn't improve piece activity. d8c8 is a slow move. h7h6 is a prophylactic move but doesn't improve piece activity.

After c6b8, the knight can later move to d7 to help defend the king and prepare for future central action. This is a quiet move but improves piece activity and prepares for future development.

c6b8

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity with their pieces.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on f6, controlling key squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a solid pawn structure and potential to develop pieces

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position

- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most natural developing move is b8c6, which:
- Develops the knight to a strong central position
- Controls key central squares
- Prepares to castle soon
- Improves piece activity and coordination
- Follows standard opening principles

Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. c7c6 is also a good move, but b8c6 is more urgent as it develops a piece that's currently blocked by the queen.

After b8c6, Black can proceed to castle and continue development, while White will likely continue to develop their pieces and prepare to castle as well.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b8c6
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:03:36,829 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:03:42,490 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.66s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity with their pieces.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the c3 knight and d3 pawn

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- d6c5: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...g5
- g7g6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...g5
- b7b6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...b5
- a7a6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...a5
- e6e5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- d6d5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- h7h5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- g7g5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- b7b5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- a7a5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action and preparing to castle later. This helps to:
- Get the king to safety
- Connect the rooks
- Prepare to develop the remaining pieces
- Counter White's central pressure

Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a proactive move that improves king safety and piece coordination.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:05:02,263 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:05:07,883 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.62s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity with their pieces.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the bishop on c4, which could become active later

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...g5
- g7g6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...g5
- b7b6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...b5
- a7a6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...a5
- e6e5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- d6d5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- h7h5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- g7g5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- b7b5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- a7a5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a quiet move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

After e8f8, the king is safer and can eventually move towards the center to help defend the position. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

- Connects the rooks
- Prepares to castle kingside, getting the king to safety
- Moves the queen to a more active position where it can help defend the king and participate in future action
- Maintains tension in the center
- Follows standard opening principles

All other moves either move pieces to less active positions or create weaknesses. f8e8 is the most logical and proactive move.

2025-08-02 13:06:52,183 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.51s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity with their pieces.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the bishop on c4, which could become active later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...g5
- g7g6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...g5
- b7b6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...b5
- a7a6: Creates a weakness but prevents future ...a5
- e6e5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- d6d5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- h7h5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- g7g5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- b7b5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- a7a5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a quiet move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

After e8f8, the king is safer and can later move towards the center to help defend the position. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

- Prepares to castle kingside, getting the king to safety
- Moves the queen to a more active position where it can help defend the king and participate in future action
- Maintains tension in the center
- Follows standard opening principles

- h7h5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- b7b5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position
- a7a5: Advances the pawn but could weaken the king position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a proactive move that helps the king get to safety and prepares for potential future action in the center.

After e8f8, the king is on a safer square and can potentially help defend the center later. Other moves don't contribute to king safety or central control.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:09:11,087 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.56s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on h3, which is well placed
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a central pawn structure and space advantage

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f8e8: Connects the rooks and prepares to castle
- d8e8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7d6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7c5: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7b4: Moves the bishop to a less active position

- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a small weakness

- a7a6: Creates a small weakness
- e6e5: Creates a small weakness
- h7h5: Creates a small weakness
- b7b5: Creates a small weakness
- a7a5: Creates a small weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, which:
- Connects the rooks
- Prepares to castle kingside, getting the king to safety
- Moves the queen to a more active position where it can help defend the king and participate in future action
- Maintains tension in the center
- Follows standard opening principles

All other moves either move pieces to less active positions or create weaknesses without preparing to defend the king.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a natural move to prepare for future development and king safety.

After e8f8, the king is closer to the action and can potentially help defend the center later. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8

2025-08-02 13:10:19,746 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:10:25,016 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.27s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on h3, which is well placed
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a solid position with good piece activity

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8e8: Connects the rooks and gets the king to safety
- d8e8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7d6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7c5: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7b4: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7a3: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness
- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- b7b6: Creates a weakness
- a7a6: Creates a weakness
- e6e5: Creates a weakness
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, which:
- Gets the king to safety
- Connects the rooks
- Prepares to potentially castle later
- Removes the queen from a less active position
- Maintains tension in the center

All other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. f8e8 is the only move that improves piece activity and king safety.

```
f8e8

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:

- Black's king is still uncastled
- White has a potential threat with the pawn structure

3. Candidate moves to consider:

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7h6. This:
- Prevents future ...g5 by White, which could create weaknesses
- Maintains flexibility in the position
- Keeps pieces active and ready to respond to White's threats
- Avoids creating unnecessary weaknesses in the pawn structure
- Allows the king to stay safe until castling can be considered later

Other moves either don't address the current threats or move pieces to less active positions. h7h6 is a proactive move that maintains tension and prevents White from gaining the initiative.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:11:36,880 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.90s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still uncastled
- White has a potential threat with the pawn structure

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7d6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7c5: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7b4: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7a3: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h6g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8h7, which:
- Moves the knight to a more active position where it can help defend the king
- Prepares for potential castling later
- Helps control central squares
- Gets the knight to a more logical position where it can participate in future action

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to defend the king.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8h7
```

2025-08-02 13:13:46,381 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.31s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the pawn structure

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8f8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves the king to a less active position
- h7g6: Moves the king to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7d6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7c5: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7b4: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e7a3: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h6g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to develop pieces and defend the king.

After g8e8, the rook will be better placed to defend the king and potentially participate in future action. This is a solid, proactive move that improves piece activity and king safety.

```
g8e8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a slight advantage with pawns, but Black's king is still in the center. 

2. Key features:

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8e7, moving the king towards the center and safety, while also preparing to potentially castle later if needed. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. d8e7 is a good move but doesn't develop the king. e8g8 is too hasty and moves the king towards the action. e8f8 is a less active position. 

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8e7

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d8e8, moving the king towards the center and potential threats from the white queen. This is a proactive move to get the king to safety and prepare for future action. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. e8 is a logical square for the king to move towards the center and potential threats.

After d8e8, the king is better placed to defend the center and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve the king's position or move pieces to less active positions.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d8e8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.

2025-08-02 13:16:17,707 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.87s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's queen is very active on e5, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- Black's king is still in the center on e8
- White has a strong central presence with pawns on c3, d3, e4, etc.

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- e8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8g8: Moves king towards the action
- e8f8: Moves king towards the center
- e8d8: Moves king towards the action
- e8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8b8: Moves king to a less active position
- a8d8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position

- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- h6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves a pawn to a less active position

- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8g8, moving the king towards the action and preparing to castle kingside, which would:
- Move the king to safety
- Connect the rooks
- Prepare to potentially challenge the white queen later
- Follow standard opening principles of king safety

Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. e8g8 is the only move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on d2
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong center with pawns on c3, d3, e3, etc.
- Black's knight on c6 is well placed, but other pieces are passive

3. Candidate moves to consider:

- g8e8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves king to a less active position

- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be a8f8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity. e7e8 is a waiting move but doesn't improve piece activity. h7g6 is a waiting move but doesn't improve piece activity. c6d8 is a waiting move but doesn't improve piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
a8f8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:

2025-08-02 13:18:11,905 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:18:17,545 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.64s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong center with pawns on c3, d3, e3, etc.
- Black's king is still on g8, uncastled
- White has threats with the knight on c6, which is very active

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f8d8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f8a8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h7g6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves a knight to a less active position

- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- h6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g7g6, which:
- Creates space for the king to potentially castle later
- Moves the pawn to a less active position, but away from potential threats
- Maintains the integrity of the pawn structure
- Prepares for potential future development

Other moves either don't address the current threats or move pieces to less active positions. g7g6 is the only move that improves the king's position and prepares for future development.

```
g7g6
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is still in the starting position (e7)
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c6, controlling key squares
- White has a passed pawn on h5, which could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8g7: Moves king towards the action
- f8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f8d8: Moves a rook to a less active position

- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8g7, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pawns. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the immediate threat to the king. e7e8 is a passive move, while g8g7 is proactive in moving the king to a more defensive position.

After g8g7, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the pawns and king. Other moves don't contribute to king safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8g7
```

2025-08-02 13:19:38,523 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:19:45,031 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.51s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is still in the starting position (e7)
- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c6, controlling key squares
- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8g8: Moves king towards the action
- f8e8: Moves king to a more central position
- f8d8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8b8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8a8: Moves king to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f6g8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the action and potentially preparing to castle later if needed. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to get the king to safety. e8 is a central, active square for the king and prepares to potentially castle later if needed.

After f8e8, the king is moving towards the center where the action is, and can potentially help defend the king later if White tries to launch an attack. Other moves don't contribute to king safety or development.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's queen is very active on c6, but could become trapped
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c6, controlling key squares
- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- e8h8: Moves king to a less active position

- e8f8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8d8: Moves king to a less active position

- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8g8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pawns. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or create weaknesses. e8g8 is a proactive move to improve king safety and prepare for potential future threats from the white queen and knights.

After e8g8, the king is better placed to help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't address the immediate threat to the king.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8g8
```

2025-08-02 13:21:11,323 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.70s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's queen is very active on g7, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c6, controlling key squares
- White has a passed pawn on d3 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves king towards the action
- g8e8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8b8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8a8: Moves king to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates space but doesn't address the king safety issue
- g7h8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- g7h6: Moves the queen to a less active position
- g7f6: Moves the queen to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- b7b6: Creates space but doesn't address the king safety issue
- a7a6: Creates space but doesn't address the king safety issue
- g6g5: Creates space but doesn't address the king safety issue
- e6e5: Creates space but doesn't address the king safety issue
- b7b5: Creates space but doesn't address the king safety issue
- a7a5: Creates space but doesn't address the king safety issue

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8f8, moving the king towards the action to potentially help defend the king and pieces under attack. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the king safety issue. e7e8 is a passive move, while g8f8 is proactive in moving the king towards the center where the action is.

After g8f8, the king can help defend the king and pieces under attack from the white queen on g7. This is a more proactive approach to improving king safety and piece defense.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

After f8e8, the king is better placed to help defend the position and potentially participate in future action. This is a solid, proactive move that improves the king's position.

- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8g8, moving the king towards the action and preparing to castle kingside, which would:
- Move the king to a safer position
- Connect the rooks
- Prepare to potentially push the f6 pawn later
- Get the king out of the center where White's pieces are active

Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. e8g8 is the most logical move to improve king safety and prepare for future action.

```
e8g8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4

2025-08-02 13:23:08,358 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:23:13,393 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.04s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on g8
- Black's king is on h7, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c6, controlling key squares
- Black's rook on g8 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves rook to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves rook to a less active position
- g8e8: Moves rook to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves rook to a less active position
- g8c8: Moves rook to a less active position
- g8b8: Moves rook to a less active position
- g8a8: Moves rook to a less active position
- g8g7: Moves rook to a less active position
- h7g7: Moves king to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves king to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves king to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White's knight on c6 is very strong, and could potentially jump to g8 later, forking the king and rook.

5. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7g7, moving the king to safety and connecting the rooks. This removes the potential threat from the white knight and improves the king's safety. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions.

After h7g7, the king is safer and the rook on g8 can potentially become more active later.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h7g7
```

2025-08-02 13:24:19,111 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.82s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's queen is very active on e4, but could become trapped
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a strong central presence with pawns on c3, d3, e4
- Black's rook on g8 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks

3. Candidate moves:

- g8f8: Moves rook to a less active position
- g8e8: Moves rook to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves rook to a less active position

The most prudent move appears to be g7h7, which:
- Moves the pawn to a less active position, but
- Creates a potential escape square for the king
- Prevents the rook on g8 from becoming trapped
- Maintains tension in the position
- Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4

2025-08-02 13:24:55,996 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:25:01,424 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.43s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is still in the starting position (e7)
- Black's king is on h7, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c6, controlling key squares
- White has a passed pawn on d3 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8a8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8g7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves the king to a less active position
- h7g7: Moves the king to a safer position
- h7h6: Moves the king to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7g7, moving the king to a safer position away from potential future threats from the white knight on c6 and the white queen on h5. This move also prepares to potentially move the rook on g8 to a more active position later. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e7e8 is a waiting move but doesn't improve king safety. c6d8 is a waiting move but doesn't improve king safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h7g7
```

2025-08-02 13:25:40,609 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.31s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is still in the center
- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black has a passed pawn on h4, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:

- g8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves the rook to a less active position

- g6g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g7h7, moving the king to a safer position and preparing to potentially castle later if needed. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the king safety issue. e7e8 is a passive move, while g7h7 is proactive in improving king safety.

After g7h7, the king is safer and can potentially move towards the center later when the position becomes more complex. Other moves don't contribute to king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g7h7
```

2025-08-02 13:26:24,242 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.68s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is still in the center
- Black's king is on h7, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black has a passed pawn on h3, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8a8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8g7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves the king to a less active position
- h7g7: Moves the king to a safer position
- h7h6: Moves the king to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a more active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a more active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7g7, moving the king to a safer position and preparing to potentially castle later if needed. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e7e8 is a passive move, c6d8 is a passive move, and most other moves are passive. h7g7 is the only move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

After h7g7, the king is safer and can potentially move to g6 later to help push the h3 pawn. Other moves don't address the king's safety issue.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h7g7
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:

- Moves the pawn to a less active position, but
- Creates a potential escape square for the king
- Prevents the rook on g8 from being trapped
- Maintains tension in the position
- Keeps the king safe from future attacks

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the immediate threat to the rook.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g7h7

- f7f5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7g7, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to defend the king. e7e8 is a passive move, while h7g7 is proactive.

After h7g7, the rook can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action when White's pieces become more active. This is a simple, defensive move that maintains piece activity and king safety.

```
h7g7

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```

2025-08-02 13:29:02,229 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.37s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the center on g8
- White has a potential passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves king towards the action
- g8e8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8b8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8a8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h7: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position

- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8f8, moving the king towards the center and potential action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e7e8 is a passive move, while g8f8 is proactive in moving the king towards the center where the action is.

After g8f8, the king is better placed to help defend the center and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or don't address the central tension.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8f8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:

2025-08-02 13:31:38,416 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:31:43,800 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.38s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed
- White has a potential passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- e8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8g8: Moves king towards the action
- e8f8: Moves king towards the center and potential threats
- e8d8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8b8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8a8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h7: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and potential threats from white's pieces. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e8f8 is a proactive move that improves the king's safety and position.

After e8f8, the king is closer to the action and can help defend the pawns in the center. Other moves don't improve piece activity or safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

- Black's king is on g7, safe

- Black's rook on f8 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can:
- Put pressure on the white king
- Potentially participate in future action
- Avoid being trapped by white pawns
- Maintain activity and pressure on white's position

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or move pawns that aren't under immediate threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8

You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.

2025-08-02 13:34:49,744 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.67s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the center on e8
- White has a potential passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- e8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8g8: Moves king towards the action
- e8f8: Moves king towards the center
- e8d8: Moves king towards the action
- e8c8: Moves king towards the action
- e8b8: Moves king towards the action
- e8a8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h7: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8g8, moving the king towards the action and preparing to potentially castle later or move the king to safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d7c8 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. c6d8 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. c6e5 is a proactive move, but the king is still in the center. e8g8 is the most logical move to improve king safety and piece activity.

After e8g8, the king is moving towards the center and potential threats from white's pawns and knights. This is a proactive move that improves piece activity and king safety.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8f8, moving the king towards the center and potential action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to get the king to safety. e7e8 is a passive move, while g8f8 is proactive in getting the king to a more active position where it can help defend the king and pawns later.

After g8f8, the king is closer to the center and potential threats from white's pieces. This is a solid, proactive move that improves the king's position and prepares for future developments.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the center and potential threats from white's pieces. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e8 is a more active position for the king and prepares to potentially castle later if needed.

After f8e8, the king is closer to the action and can help defend the center pawns. Other moves don't improve the king's position or move pieces to less active areas.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:38:43,077 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.02s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is exposed on d2
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling key squares
- Black has a knight on c6, which is well placed

3. Candidate moves:
- e8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8g8: Moves king towards the action
- e8f8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8d8: Moves king towards the action
- e8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8b8: Moves king to a less active position
- e8a8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h7: Moves a pawn to a less active position

- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8g8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pawns. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the king safety issue. e8g8 is a proactive move to improve king safety and prepare for potential future threats from white's pieces.

After e8g8, the king is closer to the center and potential threats from white's pieces. This is a solid, proactive move that improves king safety and prepares for future play.

2025-08-02 13:40:04,310 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.22s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on d2
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c6, controlling key squares
- Black has a passed pawn on h5, but it's not urgent

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g7f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pawns. Other moves either move the king to less active positions or move pieces that are not currently under attack. g7f8 is the only move that improves the king's position and helps defend the king and pawns.

After g7f8, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the king and pawns if White launches an attack. Other moves don't improve the king's position or move pieces that are not under attack.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g7f8

You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:41:07,680 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:41:12,132 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.45s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's queen is very active on c3, but could become trapped
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c6, controlling key squares
- Black has a passed pawn on e6, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8g7: Moves king towards the action
- f8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f8g7: Moves a rook to a more active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White's queen on c3 is very active and could become trapped soon. White's knight on c6 is very strong.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8g7, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't address the threats or move pieces to less active positions. g8g7 is tempting but doesn't improve piece activity. c6e5 is a good move but doesn't address the immediate threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8g7
```

2025-08-02 13:43:25,558 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.28s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c6, controlling central squares
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves king towards the action
- g8e8: Moves king to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pawns. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e7e8 is a waiting move but doesn't improve king safety. c6d8 is a waiting move but doesn't improve king safety. f7f6 is a waiting move but doesn't improve king safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8f8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:45:52,068 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.29s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c2, controlling key squares
- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed
- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- f8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8g8: Moves king towards the action
- f8e8: Moves king to a more central position
- f8d8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8b8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8a8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h7: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the center and potential action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the potential threat from the white knight on c2. e8 is a more active position for the king and prepares to potentially capture the white knight later.

After f8e8, the king is better placed to:
- Potentially capture the white knight on c2
- Support the black pawns in the center
- Move towards the action if white pushes pawns

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

2025-08-02 13:49:28,988 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.20s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c2, controlling key squares
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves king towards the action
- g8e8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8b8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8a8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves king towards the action
- g7h7: Moves king to a less active position
- g7h6: Moves king to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves king to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves king to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves king to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g7f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pawns. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the potential threat from the white knight on c2. e7e8 is a passive move, while g7f8 is proactive in moving the king towards the center and potential threats.

After g7f8, the king is better placed to help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or defense.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g7f8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8g7, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. g8g7 is tempting but doesn't improve piece activity. c6e5 is a good move but doesn't address the king safety issue. e7e8 is a passive move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8g7

2025-08-02 13:51:17,009 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.07s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous later
- Black has a passed pawn on h6, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves king towards the action
- g8e8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8d8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8c8: Moves king to a less active position

- f7f5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8f8, moving the king towards the center and potential action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e7e8 is a waiting move but doesn't improve king safety. c6d8 is a waiting move but doesn't improve king safety. f7f6 is a waiting move but doesn't improve king safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8f8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:52:34,071 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:52:39,876 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.80s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong rook on f8, but it's currently blocked by the knight on c6
- Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed
- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- f8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8g8: Trades rooks, which could help relieve pressure on the king
- f8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8d8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8a8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves the king to a less active position
- g7g8: Moves the king to a less active position
- g7h7: Moves the king to a less active position
- g7h6: Moves the king to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the king to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves the knight to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the knight to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the knight to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8g8, trading off the active rook for a less active position, but relieving pressure on the king. Other moves either don't address the pressure on the king or move pieces to less active positions. e7e8 is a passive move, while f8g8 is more proactive in relieving pressure on the king.

After f8g8, the rook trade will help the king become safer, and the rook can then move to a more active position later. This is a solid, proactive move that addresses the immediate threat to the king.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a rook on g1, which could become active later
- Black has a passed pawn on e6, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g7f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the potential threats.

Therefore, the best move is:

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:54:53,587 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:54:58,029 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.44s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a rook on f8, which could become active later
- Black has a passed pawn on e6, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8g7: Moves king towards the action
- f8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f8g7: Moves a rook to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White's rook on f8 could become active later, so moving the king towards it (g8g7) might be prudent.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8g7, moving the king towards the potential threat from the white rook on f8. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. e7e8 is a passive move, while g8g7 is proactive in moving the king towards the action.

```
g8g7

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the position and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8 is a central square that could become important later.

After f8e8, the king is better placed to help defend the position and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8

2025-08-02 13:57:42,034 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.11s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed
- White has a rook on c7, which could become active later
- Black has a passed pawn on c5, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- e8f8: Moves king towards the action
- e8d8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h7: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c7d6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White has a potential threat with the rook on c7 and knight on c3, which could become active later.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8d8, moving the king to a safer position away from potential future threats from white's rook on c7 and knight on c3. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. e8d8 is a proactive move to avoid future pressure on the king.

2025-08-02 14:00:27,145 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 14:00:42,858 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 3.96s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is on d8, somewhat exposed
- White has a rook on c7, which could become active later
- Black has a passed pawn on g6, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- d8e8: Moves king towards the action
- d8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7g8: Moves the pawn up, but doesn't help king safety
- g7h7: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c7d6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g6g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White's rook on c7 is very active and could become dangerous later. White's knight on c3 is very strong.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d8e8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't help or move pieces to less active positions. e8 is a more central and active position for the king.
