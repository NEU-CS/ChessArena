You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

2025-08-02 12:51:00,821 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.35s):
Let's analyze the position carefully:

1. The current FEN shows White has just played c2c3, a quiet move to prepare for future development. Black is to move.

2. Key features of the position:
   - White has a slight space advantage with the c3 pawn
   - Black's pieces are still undeveloped
   - White has no immediate threats

3. Candidate moves to consider:
   - g8h6: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - g8f6: Develops the knight to a natural square, controlling center
   - b8c6: Develops the knight and prepares for castling
   - b8a6: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - h7h6: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - g7g6: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - f7f6: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - e7e6: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - d7d6: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - c7c6: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - b7b6: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - a7a6: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - h7h5: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - g7g5: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - f7f5: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - e7e5: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - d7d5: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - c7c5: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - b7b5: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
   - a7a5: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces

4. Best move:
   The most natural and principled move is g8f6, developing the knight to a central square, controlling the center, and preparing for future piece development and castling. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. e7e6 is a common response but doesn't develop pieces as quickly as g8f6.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8f6
```

2025-08-02 12:51:51,275 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.77s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material is equal, but White has a slight space advantage with the c3 and a3 pawns.

2. Key features:
   - White has a strong center with pawns on c3, d2, e2
   - Black's knight on f6 is well placed, but could be improved
   - White has potential to play ...e5 soon to challenge the center

3. Candidate moves:
   - h8g8: Moves the rook to a less active position
   - b8c6: Develops the knight to a natural position, controlling the center
   - b8a6: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6g8: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - h7h6: Creates a weakness
   - g7g6: Creates a weakness
   - e7e6: Solidifies the center
   - d7d6: Solidifies the center
   - c7c6: Solidifies the center
   - b7b6: Creates a weakness
   - a7a6: Creates a weakness
   - h7h5: Creates a weakness
   - g7g5: Creates a weakness
   - e7e5: Challenges the center
   - d7d5: Challenges the center
   - c7c5: Challenges the center
   - b7b5: Challenges the center
   - a7a5: Challenges the center

4. Best move:
   The most prudent move appears to be b8c6, developing the knight to a natural position, controlling the center, and preparing to challenge White's center later with ...e5 or ...d5. Other moves either don't develop pieces or create weaknesses. e7e6 is solid but doesn't develop pieces. d7d6 is similar. c7c6 is solid but doesn't develop pieces. h8g8 is passive. The other moves either don't develop or create weaknesses.

After b8c6, Black can continue with ...e6, ...d6, ...Nf6, and ...Bg7 to complete development and challenge the center.

```
b8c6

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 12:52:59,285 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.87s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material is equal, but White has a slight space advantage with pawns on c3, d3, etc.

2. Key features:
   - White has a strong knight on c6, controlling central squares
   - Black's knight on f6 is well placed, but could be moved
   - White has potential to play e4 soon, gaining central control

3. Candidate moves to consider:
   - h8g8: Moves the rook to a less active position
   - a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
   - f6g8: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
   - h7h6: Creates a weakness
   - g7g6: Creates a weakness
   - e7e6: Solidifies the center
   - d7d6: Solidifies the center
   - b7b6: Creates a weakness
   - a7a6: Creates a weakness
   - h7h5: Creates a weakness
   - g7g5: Creates a weakness
   - e7e5: Gains central control
   - d7d5: Gains central control
   - b7b5: Creates a weakness
   - a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
   The most prudent move appears to be e7e6. This:
   - Solidifies the center
   - Prepares to challenge White's central control
   - Maintains tension and flexibility in the position
   - Prevents White from gaining a strong central presence
   - Keeps all pieces active and ready to participate in future action

Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. e7e6 is the most logical response to White's potential e4 push.

```
e7e6
```

2025-08-02 12:53:47,163 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.59s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material is equal, but White has a slight space advantage with pawns on c3, d3, e3, h4, etc.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on f3, controlling central squares
- Black's knight on c6 is well placed, but other pieces are undeveloped
- White has potential to play ...e5 soon to challenge center

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- h8g8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8e7: Develops the bishop and prepares to challenge the center
- f8d6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f8c5: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f8b4: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e8e7: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8e7: Develops the bishop and prepares to challenge the center
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f6g8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position

- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- d7d6: Creates a weakness
- b7b6: Creates a weakness

- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- d7d5: Creates a weakness
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e7, developing the bishop to a natural square, preparing to challenge the center with ...e5 later, and connecting the rooks. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. d8e7 is similar but doesn't connect the rooks. e8e7 is passive. c6e7 is passive. h8g8 is passive. f6g8 is passive.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e7
```

2025-08-02 12:54:28,985 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 2.11s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material is equal, but White has slightly more space and activity.
2. White's knight on f3 is well placed, controlling central squares.
3. Black's king is still in the starting position, uncastled.
4. White has a strong center with pawns on c3, d2, e3, etc.

Key considerations:
- Castling is a priority to get the king to safety and connect the rooks.
- The move e8g8 (castling kingside) is a natural response to get the king to safety.
- Other moves like h8g8 are redundant as the rook is already on h8.
- Moves like c6b8 are passive and don't address the central tension.

The most prudent move appears to be e8g8 (castling kingside), which:
1. Moves the king to safety
2. Connects the rooks
3. Prepares to contest the center later
4. Follows standard opening principles

All other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. Castling is the most logical move here.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.

2025-08-02 12:55:19,270 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 12:55:24,820 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.55s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have equal material, but White has slightly more activity with their pieces.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on f3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the pawn on c3, which could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8e8: Connects the rooks and prepares to castle
- d8e8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7d6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e7c5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e7b4: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness
- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- d7d6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- d7d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, connecting the rooks and preparing to castle kingside, which will:
- Get the king to safety
- Connect the rooks for future action
- Prepare to challenge White's central control
- Follow the principle of development before castling

All other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but doesn't connect the rooks. c6b8 is a passive move. e7d6 is a passive move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

2. Key features:

- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the knight on e3, which could jump to f5 later

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d7d6. This:
- Creates a small weakness but prevents future ...d5
- Prepares to develop the light-squared bishop later
- Maintains tension in the center
- Keeps the king safe from future threats
- Follows the principle of moving pieces towards the center and development

Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. d7d6 is a solid, proactive move that follows chess principles.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 12:57:16,943 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 12:57:21,925 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.98s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on f3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the knight on f3 and pawns on d3, c3, etc.

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8d7: Moves the queen to a less active position
- c8d7: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6d7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness
- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- b7b6: Creates a weakness
- a7a6: Creates a weakness
- e6e5: Creates a weakness
- d6d5: Creates a weakness
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- b7b5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action and preparing to castle later. Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a proactive move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

After e8f8, the king can later move to g8 and castle, getting the king to safety and connecting the rooks. This is a standard developing move in the opening phase.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

- Move the rook to a more active position
- Prepare the king to move to safety
- Allow the queen to move to a more active position later
- Improve piece coordination

All other moves either move pieces to less active positions or create weaknesses. f8e8 is the most logical move to improve piece activity and prepare for future development.

2025-08-02 12:59:36,259 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.93s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c2, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c2 and pawns on d3, e3, etc.

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8d7: Moves the queen to a less active position
- c8d7: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6d7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7h6: Creates a weakness
- g7g6: Creates a weakness
- b7b6: Creates a weakness
- a7a6: Creates a weakness
- e6e5: Creates a weakness
- d6d5: Creates a weakness
- h7h5: Creates a weakness
- g7g5: Creates a weakness
- a7a5: Creates a weakness

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action and preparing to castle later. Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a proactive move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

After e8f8, the king is closer to the center and can potentially castle later to get the king to safety. Other moves don't contribute to development or king safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on b3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the rook on h2 and bishop on c2

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position

- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8d7: Moves the queen to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7h6. This:
- Prevents future ...g5 from White, which could create a weakness
- Maintains the integrity of the king position
- Keeps the king safe from potential future threats from the rook on h2
- Is a simple, prophylactic move that doesn't move pieces to less active positions

Other moves either don't address the potential threat or move pieces to less active positions. h7h6 is a quiet move that prevents future problems.

2025-08-02 13:02:31,182 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:02:55,475 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:03:01,034 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.56s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity with the knight on d3 and the rook on h2.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the knight on d3 and rook on h2

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8d7: Moves the queen to a less active position
- c8d7: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action and preparing to castle later. This move:
- Gets the king to safety
- Connects the rooks
- Prepares to potentially castle later to get the king to safety
- Moves the king towards the center where the action is

All other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is the only move that improves the king's position and prepares for future development.

```
e8f8

Therefore, the best move is:

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:04:29,277 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:04:34,382 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.11s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c3, which could jump to d5 later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8d7: Moves the queen to a less active position
- c8d7: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action and preparing to castle later. This helps to:
- Get the king to safety
- Connect the rooks
- Prepare to develop the remaining pieces
- Counter White's potential central pressure

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a proactive move that improves the king's safety and prepares for future development.

Therefore, the best move is:

2025-08-02 13:06:09,436 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.23s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the starting position
- White has a potential threat with the knight on d3 and pawns on c3, d3, e3

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8d7: Moves the queen to a less active position
- c8d7: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be c8d7, moving the bishop to a more active position where it can help defend the king and prepare for future development. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a passive move, while c8d7 is proactive development.

After c8d7, the bishop will help defend the king and prepare for future piece development. This is a solid, proactive move that improves piece activity and prepares for future play.

```
c8d7

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the knight on d4, which could jump to e6 later
- Black's rooks are still undeveloped

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a natural move that helps the king get to safety and prepares for future development.

After e8f8, the king is safer and can eventually move towards the center to support piece development and potential future action. Other moves don't contribute to development or safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

- White has a potential threat with the rook on g3 and bishop on c2

3. Candidate moves to consider:

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves the queen, which is less urgent than moving the rook to defend the king.

After f8e8, the rook will be better placed to defend the king and potentially participate in future action. This is a solid, proactive move that improves piece activity and defense.

```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:08:00,984 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:08:06,580 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.60s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on f2, controlling key squares
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the rook on g3 and bishop on c2

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king towards the action
- d8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action and preparing to castle later. This helps to:
- Get the king to safety
- Connect the rooks
- Prepare to potentially castle later
- Start developing the king-side pieces

Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a proactive move that improves king safety and piece development.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a slight advantage with pawns, but Black's king is still in the center. 

2. Key features:

- White has a potential threat with the knight on c2 and pawns on d3, e3, etc.

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position

- f8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves a different rook. g8h7 is a passive move. c6b8 is a passive move. e6e5 is a passive move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

2025-08-02 13:09:02,874 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:09:02,874 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:09:08,515 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.64s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a slight advantage with pawns, but Black's king is still in the center. 

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c2, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still on e8, uncastled
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c2, which could jump to e3 later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a natural move to prepare for future development and king safety.

After e8f8, the king is moving towards the center where action is likely to occur, and other pieces can be developed around it. This is a solid, proactive move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

```
e8f8

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves a different rook. g8h7 is a passive move. c6b8 is a passive move. e6e5 is a passive move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8

When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.

2025-08-02 13:10:53,395 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.69s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a slight advantage with pawns, but Black's king is still in the center. 

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c2, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still on e8, uncastled
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c2, which could jump to e3 later

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a natural move to prepare for future development and king safety.

After e8f8, the king is closer to the action and can potentially castle later to get the king to safety. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece development.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves the queen, which is less urgent than moving the rook to defend the king.

After f8e8, the rook can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action when the king is castled. This is a proactive move to improve piece activity and defense.

- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a natural move to prepare for future development and king safety.

After e8f8, the king is moving towards the center where action is likely to occur, and other pieces can be developed around it. This is a solid, proactive move that improves the king's position and prepares for future development.

```
e8f8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4

2025-08-02 13:13:26,972 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.30s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d2, but it's not immediately threatening
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous later
- Black has a knight on f6 that's well placed, but could be moved

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8e8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position

- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves the queen, which is less urgent to defend the king. g8h7 moves the rook to a less active position. c6b8 moves the knight to a less active position. e6d5 moves the pawn to a less active position.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:15:15,260 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.35s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d2, but it's not immediately threatening
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous later
- Black has a knight on f6 that's well placed, but could be moved

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves a different rook. c6b8 is a passive move. e6d5 is a passive move. g7g6 is a passive move. a7a6 is a passive move. h6h5 is a passive move. e6e5 is a passive move. g7g5 is a passive move. a7a5 is a passive move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a natural move to improve king safety and prepare for future development.

After e8f8, the king is safer and can later move to e7 to help defend the center. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8

2025-08-02 13:16:50,595 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:16:50,595 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:16:56,091 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.50s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d2, but it's not immediately threatening
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the knight on d2, which could jump to e4 later
- Black's knight on f6 is well placed, but could be moved

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8e8: Moves the king towards the action
- d8e8: Moves the queen towards the action
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c7b6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the center and prepare for potential future threats from the white knight on d2. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the potential threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

2025-08-02 13:17:36,998 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.90s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the knight on d3 and pawns

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king towards the action

- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the position and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e8f8 is a proactive move to improve king safety and position.

After e8f8, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the position as White may try to increase pressure with the knight on d3 and pawns.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

2025-08-02 13:18:28,976 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.47s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d2, but it's not immediately threatening
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the knight on d5, but it's not immediate
- Black's knight on c6 is well placed, but could be moved

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f8e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8e8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8c7: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b6: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8a5: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position

- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position

- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h6h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves the queen, which is less important than moving a rook that's currently passive.

After f8e8, the rook will be better placed to defend the king and potentially participate in future action. This is a simple, proactive move that improves piece activity and king safety.

```
f8e8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the knight on d5, which could jump to e7 later

3. Candidate moves:

- g8h7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a natural move to improve king safety and prepare for future development.

After e8f8, the king is safer and can later move to e7 to help defend the center. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves the queen, which is less urgent than moving the rook to defend the king.

After f8e8, the rook is better placed to defend the king and potentially participate in future action. This is a solid, proactive move that improves piece activity and defense.

```
f8e8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:21:42,212 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.93s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d2, but it's not immediately threatening
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c3, which could jump to d5 later
- Black's knight on f6 is well placed, but could be moved

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8c7: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b6: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8a5: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the king to a less active position

- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is a quiet move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

After e8f8, the king is safer and can eventually move towards the action. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is similar but moves the queen, which is less important than moving a rook that's currently passive.

After f8e8, the rook will be better placed to defend the king and potentially participate in future action when the position becomes more dynamic.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:23:56,892 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.77s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d2, but it's not immediately threatening
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the knight on d2, which could jump to e4 later
- Black has a passed pawn on h5, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e8f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8c7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8b6: Moves the rook to a less active position
- d8a5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7f8: Moves the king to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the king to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e7f8, moving the king towards the center and safety. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e7f8 is a quiet move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

After e7f8, the king is safer and can eventually move towards the action. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e7f8
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

The most prudent move appears to be e8e7, moving the king towards the action and preparing to castle later. This helps to:
- Get the king to safety
- Connect the rooks
- Prepare to potentially castle later
- Start moving pieces towards the center where the action is

All other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e8e7 is the only move that makes progress towards improving piece activity and king safety.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:25:50,156 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.79s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d6, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a potential threat with the knight on d6, which could jump to e8 later

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- g8h8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g8h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- d8e8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8c7: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8b6: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d8a5: Moves the queen to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8h7, moving the knight to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension.

After g8h7, the knight is better placed to defend the king and potentially jump to g5 later to challenge the white knight on d6. This is a proactive move that improves piece activity and defense.

```
g8h7
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.

2025-08-02 13:27:36,991 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.17s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on d4, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the center on e8
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c6, which could jump to d8 later

3. Candidate moves:
- e8d8: Moves king towards the action
- e8c8: Moves king to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6g8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7g6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7g5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8d8, moving the king towards the center and potential threats from the white knight on c6. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. d8 is a more active position for the king and prepares to potentially castle later if needed.

After e8d8, the king is safer and can help defend the center pawns. Other moves don't improve piece activity or safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8d8
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d8e8, moving the king towards the center and away from potential threats from the white knight on d5. Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or move pieces to less active positions. e8 is a more active square for the king, and the king will need to move towards the action eventually anyway.

After d8e8, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the position. Other moves don't improve the king's position or move pieces to less active positions.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d8e8

White's knight on c3 is very strong and could jump to g7 later, forking king and pawns.

After g7f6, the king moves towards the threat and blocks the knight's path. 
After h7h8, the king moves up but doesn't address the threat.

Therefore, g7f6 is the more prudent move, moving the king towards the potential threat and blocking the knight's path. h7h8 doesn't help.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4

2025-08-02 13:30:01,037 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.70s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still on e8, uncastled
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c3 and bishop on d4

3. Candidate moves:
- f8g7: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- e8d8: Moves the king towards the action
- e8c8: Moves the king to a less active position
- e8b8: Moves the king to a less active position
- a8d8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8c8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a8b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h7g8: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h7g7: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- c6d8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- f6f5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8d8, moving the king towards the center and potential threats from white's pieces. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. d8 is a more active position for the king and prepares to potentially castle later if needed.

After e8d8, the king is closer to the action and can help defend the pawns. Other moves don't improve piece activity or don't address the threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8d8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:31:39,193 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:31:45,021 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.83s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still in the center on d8
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c6, which could jump to e5 later

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- d8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- d8g8: Moves king towards the action
- d8f8: Moves king towards the center
- d8e8: Moves king towards the center
- d8c8: Moves king towards the action
- d8b8: Moves king towards the action
- d8c7: Moves king towards the action
- d8b6: Moves king towards the action
- a8c8: Moves a rook to a more active position
- a8b8: Moves a rook to a more active position
- h7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h7g8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f6f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be a8c8, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't address the central tension or move pieces to less active positions. d8e8 is tempting but doesn't improve piece activity. c6e5 is a good move but doesn't help the king. a8c8 is the most proactive move that improves piece activity and defense.

After a8c8, the rook can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action when the white knight jumps to e5. This is a slow but solid improvement in piece activity and defense.

You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:33:43,841 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.14s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's queen is very active on e2, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- Black's king is on h7, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black has a passed pawn on d6, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- d8h8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d8g8: Moves queen to a more active position, but doesn't address king safety
- d8f8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d8e8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves queen to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves king to a less active position
- h7g8: Moves king to a more active position, but doesn't address threats
- g7h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves king to a more active position, but doesn't address threats
- e7e8: Moves king to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves king to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves king to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves king to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves knight to a more active position, but doesn't address king safety
- c6a5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves knight to a more active position, but doesn't address king safety
- c6b4: Moves knight to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves pawn to a less active position
- f6f5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White's queen on e2 is very active and could deliver checks soon. White's knight on c3 is very strong, controlling central squares.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7g8, moving the king towards the action and potentially preparing to castle out of future threats. Other moves don't address the immediate threat to the king. e7e8 is a passive move, moving the king to a less active position. d7e8 is similar. c7c8 is passive. c6b8 is passive. c6e5 is active but doesn't help the king. h7h8 is passive. g7h8 is passive. g7f8 is active but doesn't help the king. d8g8 is active but doesn't help the king. d8h8 is passive. d8f8 is passive. d8e8 is passive. d8c8 is passive. d8b8 is passive. d8a8 is passive.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h7g8
```

2025-08-02 13:34:50,367 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.12s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on b2
- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's queen on d8 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves king towards the action
- g8h7: Moves king to a potentially dangerous position
- d8f8: Moves queen to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White has a strong knight on c3, which could jump to d5 or e6 later, putting pressure on the king.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8h7. This moves the king to a safer position, away from potential future threats from the white knight on c3. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. g8h7 prepares to potentially move the king to g6 later if needed to escape future threats.

4. Threats to watch:
White has a strong knight on c3, which could jump to d5 later, putting pressure on the queen.

5. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7g8, moving the king towards the action and potentially preparing to castle out of future threats. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. e7e8 is a passive move, while h7g8 is proactive in moving the king towards the center and potential threats.

After h7g8, the king is safer and can potentially move towards the action later. Other moves don't improve piece activity or safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h7g8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

2025-08-02 13:36:11,139 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.96s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still on g8, uncastled
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c3 and pawns

3. Candidate moves:
- g8h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g8f8: Moves king towards the action
- g8h7: Moves king to a potentially dangerous position
- d8f8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- a7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f6f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g8f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the position. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. e7e8 is a passive move, while g8f8 is proactive in moving the king to a more defensive position.

After g8f8, the king can help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or defense.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g8f8
```

<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:38:12,046 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:38:15,696 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 3.65s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is still on e8, uncastled
- White has a potential threat with the knight on c3 and pawns

3. Candidate moves:
- e8f8: Moves king towards the action
- d8c8: Moves a rook to safety
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to safety
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to safety
- d7c8: Moves a rook to safety
- c7c8: Moves a rook to safety
- c6b8: Moves a knight to safety
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to the edge
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a central position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to safety
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to safety
- f6f5: Moves a pawn to safety
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to safety
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to safety
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to safety
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to safety

4. Threats to watch:
White has a potential threat with the knight on c3 and pawns, so moving the king towards the action (e8f8) could be prudent.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the position and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to safety or move pieces to less active positions. e8f8 is the only move that improves the king's position and helps defend the position.

2025-08-02 13:39:17,438 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.36s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is still in the center
- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's rooks are active, but could be vulnerable to attacks

3. Candidate moves:
- f8g8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8e8: Moves king towards the action
- d8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position

- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the rooks and pawns. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e8 is a more active square for the king and helps defend the rooks on d8 and c8.

After f8e8, the king is better placed to help defend the position and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or defense.

2025-08-02 13:40:19,574 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 3.96s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong rook on h1, which could become active later

3. Candidate moves:
- e8f8: Moves king towards the action
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a more active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f6f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a7a5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White's rook on h1 could become active later, so moving the king towards it (e8f8) could be prudent.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action and potentially preparing to defend the king later if White's rook becomes active. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions.

```
e8f8

2025-08-02 13:41:20,866 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.63s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on c2
- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong center with pawns on d3, e3, c3
- Black's pawns are scattered and not very advanced

3. Candidate moves:
- f8g8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8e8: Moves king towards the action
- d8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position

- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the center and potential action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e8 is a more active square for the king and prepares to potentially help defend the king later if White launches an attack.

After f8e8, the king is better placed to help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or don't address the central tension.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

2025-08-02 13:42:55,103 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:43:21,215 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:43:25,654 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.44s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed
- White has a potential threat with the rook on h3 and bishop on g3

3. Candidate moves:
- f8g8: Moves king towards the action
- f8e8: Moves king to a less active position
- d8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a7: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6f5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White has a potential threat with the rook on h3 and bishop on g3, which could become active later.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king to a safer position and preparing to potentially move the rook on d8 to a more active position later. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. f8e8 is a proactive move to improve king safety and prepare for future action.

```

2025-08-02 13:44:14,398 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:44:18,637 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.24s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is still in the center (c2)
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black has a passed pawn on h6, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- e8f8: Moves king towards the action
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a7: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f6f5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the center and potential action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the central tension. e8f8 is a proactive move that improves the king's safety and prepares to potentially castle later or move the king to g8 to avoid future threats from white's pieces.

After e8f8, the king is safer and can potentially move to g8 later to avoid future threats from white's pieces. Other moves don't improve piece activity or safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:45:11,253 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.55s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on c2
- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong center with pawns on d3, e3, c3
- Black's pawns are scattered and not very advanced

3. Candidate moves:
- f8g8: Moves king to a less active position
- f8e8: Moves king towards the action
- d8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a7: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f6f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the center and potential action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to improve king safety. e8 is a more active square for the king and closer to the center where the action is.

After f8e8, the king is better placed to help defend pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or king safety as much.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to defend the king. e8f8 is a proactive move that improves the king's position and prepares to help defend the pawns.

After e8f8, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the pawns from potential future threats. Other moves don't improve piece activity or king safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8

- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the center and potential action from the rook on g1. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. f8e8 is a proactive move that improves the king's safety and position.

After f8e8, the king is closer to the action and can help defend the pawns if needed. Other moves don't address the potential threat from the white rook on g1.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8e8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

2025-08-02 13:48:59,835 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.37s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on c2
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c2, controlling key squares
- Black's pawns are mostly static, except for the c6 knight which is active

3. Candidate moves:
- e8f8: Moves king towards the action
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a7: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to defend the king. e8f8 is a proactive move that improves the king's safety and position.

After e8f8, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the pawns from potential future threats. Other moves don't contribute to king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-08-02 13:51:06,525 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.71s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on c2, somewhat exposed
- Black's king is on e8, also exposed
- White has a strong knight on c2, controlling key squares
- Black has a strong knight on c6, but it's currently blocked

3. Candidate moves:
- e8f8: Moves king towards the action
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7d4: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a7: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pieces. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the immediate threat to the king. e8f8 is a proactive move to improve king safety.

After e8f8, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the king and pieces. Other moves don't improve king safety or move pieces to less active positions.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the immediate threat to the king. e8 is a more active position for the king, closer to the center and potential threats.

After f8e8, the king can help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or defense of the king.

Therefore, the best move is:

Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:53:51,921 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.86s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is exposed on e2
- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- Black has a passed pawn on h6, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- e8f8: Moves king towards the action
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7d4: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a7: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pawns. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the immediate threat to the king. e8f8 is a proactive move to improve king safety.

After e8f8, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the pawns from potential future threats. Other moves don't contribute to king safety or don't move pieces to more active positions.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e8f8
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8e8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the position and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to defend the king. e8 is a more active square for the king and closer to the center where action may develop.

After f8e8, the king is better placed to help defend the position and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or defense.

- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White's rook on d3 is very active and could become dangerous later.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e8f8, moving the king towards the action to help defend the position and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the potential threat from the white rook.

```
e8f8

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:58:01,193 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.10s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is exposed on c2
- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong rook on g1, but it's not immediately threatening
- Black has a passed pawn on c6, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- f8g8: Moves king towards the action
- f8e8: Moves king to a less active position
- d8e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8c8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g7h8: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g7d4: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves a pawn to a less active position

- d7c8: Moves a pawn to a less active position

- c6b8: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a7: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e6e5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
White's rook on g1 is threatening the king, but not immediately. White's king is exposed and could become a target later.

5. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f8g8, moving the king towards the action to potentially help defend the king and pawns from future threats from the white rook on g1. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the immediate threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f8g8

When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 14:00:38,778 - INFO - Raw response from Black (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.68s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on c2
- Black's king is on h7, somewhat exposed
- White has a strong center with pawns on d3, c3, etc.
- Black's queen is on d8, somewhat passive

3. Candidate moves:
- d8h8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d8g8: Moves queen to a more active position
- d8f8: Moves queen to a more active position
- d8e8: Moves queen to a more active position
- d8c8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d8b8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d8a8: Moves queen to a less active position
- h7h8: Moves king to a less active position
- h7g8: Moves king to a more active position
- g7h8: Moves king to a less active position
- g7f8: Moves king to a more active position
- g7f6: Moves king to a more active position
- g7e5: Moves king to a less active position
- g7d4: Moves king to a less active position
- e7e8: Moves queen to a less active position
- e7e6: Moves queen to a less active position
- d7e8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d7c8: Moves queen to a less active position
- d7e6: Moves queen to a less active position
- c7c8: Moves queen to a less active position
- c6b8: Moves queen to a less active position
- c6a7: Moves queen to a less active position
- c6e5: Moves queen to a less active position
- c6a5: Moves queen to a less active position
- c6d4: Moves queen to a less active position
- c6b4: Moves queen to a less active position
- f7e6: Moves queen to a less active position
- h6g5: Moves queen to a less active position
- f7f6: Moves queen to a less active position
- b7b6: Moves queen to a less active position
- d6d5: Moves queen to a less active position
- f7f5: Moves queen to a less active position
- b7b5: Moves queen to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7g8, moving the king to a more active position where it can help defend the queen and pawns. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e7e8 is a passive move, while h7g8 is proactive.

After h7g8, the king is better placed to help defend the queen and pawns, and can potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity as much.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h7g8
```
