2025-08-02 12:50:27,776 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 12:50:31,857 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.08s):
Let me analyze the position and candidate moves step by step:

1. Current position: Starting position, no pieces developed yet.

2. Candidate moves to consider:
- g1h3: Moves knight to a less active position
- g1f3: Develops knight to a natural square, controlling center
- b1c3: Develops knight and controls center
- b1a3: Moves knight to a less active position
- h2h3: Creates a wasted pawn move
- g2g3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- f2f3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e2e3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- d2d3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c2c3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- b2b3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2h4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2g4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- f2f4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e2e4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- d2d4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c2c4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- b2b4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a4: Moves pawn to a less active position

3. Best move:
The most natural developing moves that control the center are:
- g1f3 (developing the knight to a strong central position)
- b1c3 (developing the other knight to a strong central position)
- e2e4 (advancing the central pawn to control space)

Among these, e2e4 is the most proactive move, advancing the central pawn to control space and prepare for future development. The other moves are either less active or move pieces to less important positions.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e2e4
```

2025-08-02 12:51:21,717 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.88s):
Let me analyze the position and candidate moves step by step:

1. Current position: 
- White has just played e4, establishing a central presence.
- Black has responded with ...c5, challenging the center.
- It's White's turn to move (move 2).

2. Key principles to consider:
- Control of the center
- Development of pieces
- King safety
- Potential for future action

3. Candidate moves evaluation:
- g1h3: Moves knight to a less active position
- g1f3: Develops the knight to a natural square, controlling center
- g1e2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f1a6: Moves bishop to a less active position
- f1b5: Develops the bishop to a natural square, controlling center
- f1c4: Develops the bishop to a natural square, controlling center
- f1d3: Moves bishop to a less active position
- f1e2: Moves bishop to a less active position
- e1e2: Moves the king to a less active position
- d1h5: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d1g4: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d1f3: Moves the queen to a less active position
- d1e2: Moves the queen to a less active position
- b1c3: Develops the knight to a natural square, controlling center
- b1a3: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e4e5: Advances the pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, d2d3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, d2d4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4: These are mostly passive moves or don't develop pieces.

4. Best move:
The most natural and principled move is g1f3, developing the knight to a central square, controlling the center, and preparing for future action. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. b1c3 is also good but develops the other knight, but g1f3 is more urgent as it's the first opportunity to develop a piece.

After g1f3, White can continue with other development moves like b1c3, d2d3, etc., maintaining central control and piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g1f3
```

- h2h3, g2g3, etc.: Minor pawn moves

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be b1c3, developing the knight to an active position, controlling central squares, and preparing for future piece development. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. f1c4 is tempting but doesn't develop a minor piece. e1e2 is a passive move. h1g1 is a passive move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b1c3
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-08-02 12:52:45,046 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.54s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material is equal, but White has slightly more space and better piece activity.

2. Key features:
- White's knight on c3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- White's king is still in the starting position
- Black has a solid position with pawns on c5, d5, etc.

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3a4: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3e2: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b1: Moves knight to a less active position
- h1g1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f1a6: Moves bishop to a less active position
- f1b5: Moves bishop to a less active position
- f1c4: Moves bishop to a less active position
- f1d3: Moves bishop to a less active position
- f1e2: Moves bishop to a less active position
- e1e2: Moves king to a less active position
- d1e2: Moves queen to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- e4d5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e4e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2h3, g2g3, etc.: Moves pawns to less active positions
- d2d3, b2b3, etc.: Moves pawns to less active positions

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d2d3, which:
- Develops the pawn structure
- Controls the center
- Prepares to castle soon
- Maintains tension in the center
- Keeps pieces active and ready to participate in future action

Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. d2d3 is a solid, proactive move that improves White's position.

2025-08-02 12:53:42,625 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.84s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have equal material, but White has slightly more central control.

2. Key features:
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- White's bishop on c1 is undeveloped
- Black has a solid position with pawns on c5, d5, etc.

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves a central piece, but doesn't develop
- c3b5: Moves a central piece, but doesn't develop
- c3a4: Moves a central piece, but doesn't develop
- c3e2: Moves a central piece, but doesn't develop
- c3b1: Moves a central piece, but doesn't develop
- h1g1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f1e2: Develops the bishop and connects the rooks
- e1e2: Moves the king to a less active position

- d1e2: Develops the queen and connects the rooks
- d1d2: Moves the queen to a less active position
- c1h6: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1g5: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1f4: Develops the bishop and connects the rooks
- c1e3: Develops the bishop and connects the rooks
- c1d2: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e4d5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop
- e4e5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop
- d3d4: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop
- h2h3, g2g3, etc.: Moves pawns to less active positions

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f1e2, which:
- Develops the bishop to a more active position
- Connects the rooks
- Prepares for future central action
- Maintains tension in the center
- Follows the principle of development before castling

Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. d1e2 is similar but moves the queen, which is less urgent to develop than the bishop. c1f4 is a good move but doesn't connect the rooks. h1g1 is a slow move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f1e2
```

2025-08-02 12:55:00,369 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 12:55:06,193 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.82s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White's king is still in the starting position
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- White has the option to castle short (e1g1) which would bring the rook to an active position and start king safety

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c3b5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c3a4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c3b1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e2f1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- h1g1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- h1f1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e1d2: Moves the king to a less active position
- e1f1: Moves the king to a less active position
- d1d2: Moves the queen to a less active position
- c1h6: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- c1g5: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- c1f4: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- c1e3: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- c1d2: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e1g1: Castles short, bringing the rook to an active position and starting king safety
- e4d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e4e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- d3d4: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h2h3, g2g3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, b2b4, a2a4: Moves pawns to less active positions

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e1g1 (castling short). This:
- Moves the king to safety
- Connects the rooks
- Brings the rook to an active position where it can participate in future action
- Follows the principle of development and king safety
- Is a natural move that doesn't move pieces to less active positions

All other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't contribute to development or king safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e1g1
```

4. Best move:
The most logical move appears to be f1e1, connecting the rooks and putting pressure on the center. This is a solid, developing move that improves piece activity and prepares for future central battles. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. c1e3 is tempting but doesn't connect the rooks. d1e1 is a queen move that doesn't develop pieces. 

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f1e1
```

When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 12:58:46,154 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.51s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has slightly more activity.

2. Key features:
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- White's king is still in the starting position
- Black has a slight initiative due to better piece activity

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't improve piece activity
- c3b5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't improve piece activity
- c3a4: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't improve piece activity
- c3b1: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't improve piece activity
- e2f1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g1h1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- g1f1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- e1f1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d1d2: Moves a queen to a less active position
- c1h6: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1g5: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1f4: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1e3: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1d2: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- e4d5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't improve piece activity
- e4e5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't improve piece activity
- d3d4: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't improve piece activity
- h2h3, g2g3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, b2b4, a2a4: Moves pawns to less active positions

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e1f1, connecting the rooks and preparing to castle kingside later. This improves piece activity and safety, and is a standard development move. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. c1g5 is tempting but doesn't improve piece activity. a1b1 is a slow move. d1d2 is a slow move. e2f1 is a slow move. g1h1 is a slow move. g1f1 is a slow move. h2h3 is a slow move. g2g3 is a slow move. b2b3 is a slow move. a2a3 is a slow move. h2h4 is a slow move. g2g4 is a slow move. b2b4 is a slow move. a2a4 is a slow move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e1f1
```

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d1e1 is similar but moves the queen, which is less urgent than improving rook activity.

After f1e1, White can later play ...Nxe5 or ...d4 to challenge the center, with the rooks connected and ready to participate.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f1e1

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e1f1, moving the rook to a more active position where it can support the center and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e1f1 is a simple, proactive move that improves the rook's position and prepares for future central action.

```
e1f1

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:02:51,374 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.59s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe, but no pieces are very active
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- White's bishop on c1 is blocked and not very active
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3a4: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b1: Moves knight to a less active position

- b2b3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2g4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f1e1, connecting the rooks and putting pressure on the central squares controlled by the black knight on c3. This move improves piece activity and prepares for future central action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions.

After f1e1, the rook on f1 is more active and can later participate in central action or defend the king. The queen on d1 is also better placed to support central action.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f1e1
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:05:49,262 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.50s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White's king is slightly more exposed.

2. Key features:
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- White's bishop on c1 is undeveloped
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which could become active later

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- c3b5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- c3a4: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- c3b1: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- g1h1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f1e1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- d1d2: Moves a queen to a less active position
- d1e1: Moves a queen to a less active position
- c1h6: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1g5: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1f4: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1e3: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- c1d2: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- e4d5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- e4e5: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- d3d4: Moves a central pawn, but doesn't develop pieces
- h2h3: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
- g2g3: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
- b2b3: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
- a2a3: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
- g2g4: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces
- a2a4: Creates space but doesn't develop pieces

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f1e1, connecting the rooks and preparing to potentially exchange central pawns later, which could help White's king safety. Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. c1e3 is tempting but doesn't address the central tension. d1d2 is a passive move. e4d5 is a pawn trade that doesn't develop pieces.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f1e1
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e1f1, moving the rook to a more active position where it can support the center and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity. e1f1 is a simple, proactive move that improves the rook's position and prepares for potential central action.

After e1f1, the rook can later move to f6 or f7 to participate in action, or support the center. It's a quiet move but improves piece activity.

```
e1f1

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:08:25,579 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.89s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White's king is slightly exposed.

2. Key features:
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- White's bishop on c1 is undeveloped
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3a4: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b1: Moves knight to a less active position
- e2d3: Moves bishop to a less active position
- g1h1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f1e1: Moves rook to a less active position
- d1d3: Moves queen to a less active position
- d1d2: Moves queen to a less active position
- d1e1: Moves queen to a less active position

- c1g5: Moves bishop to a less active position
- c1f4: Moves bishop to a less active position
- c1e3: Moves bishop to a less active position
- c1d2: Moves bishop to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- e4d5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c2d3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e4e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2h3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2g3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- b2b3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2g4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f1e1, connecting the rooks and putting pressure on the central squares controlled by the black knight on c3. This move improves piece activity and prepares for future central action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions.

After f1e1, the rook on f1 is still well placed, but the rook on f1 is now connected with the rook on e1, putting pressure on the central squares. This is a solid, proactive move that improves piece activity and prepares for future central action.

```
f1e1
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is also safe
- White's pieces are somewhat passive

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e1f1, moving the king towards the action and potentially preparing to castle later if needed. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e1f1 is a quiet move that improves king safety and prepares for future development.

After e1f1, the king is safer and can potentially move towards the center later if needed. Other moves don't address the need for king safety or piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e1f1
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:10:49,948 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.53s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is also safe
- White's pieces are somewhat passive
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- White has a central pawn structure but no initiative

3. Candidate moves:
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3a4: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3e2: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b1: Moves knight to a less active position
- g1h1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f1e1: Moves rook to a less active position
- d1e2: Moves queen to a less active position
- d1d2: Moves queen to a less active position
- d1e1: Moves queen to a less active position
- c1d2: Moves bishop to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- e4d5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e4e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2h3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2g3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- b2b3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2g4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f1e1, connecting the rooks and preparing to potentially challenge the center later. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. d1e2 is tempting but doesn't improve piece activity. c1d2 is a slow move. a1b1 is a slow move. e4d5 is a slow move. h2h3 is a slow move. g2g3 is a slow move. b2b3 is a slow move. a2a3 is a slow move. g2g4 is a slow move. a2a4 is a slow move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f1e1
```

- Moves the pawn to a more active position
- Creates space for the king to potentially castle later
- Prepares to potentially push the g-pawn later to create pressure
- Is a quiet move that doesn't move pieces to less active positions
- Maintains the status quo while improving piece activity

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity. g2g3 is the only move that improves piece activity and prepares for future development.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is still in the starting position
- Black's king is also uncastled
- White's pieces are somewhat passive
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling central squares
- White has a potential threat from the knight on c3

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b5: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3a4: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3e2: Moves knight to a less active position
- c3b1: Moves knight to a less active position
- g1g2: Moves rook to a less active position
- g1h1: Moves rook to a less active position
- g1f1: Moves rook to a less active position
- e1e3: Moves bishop to a less active position
- e1e2: Moves bishop to a less active position
- e1f1: Moves bishop to a less active position
- d1e2: Moves queen to a less active position
- d1d2: Moves queen to a less active position
- c1d2: Moves bishop to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- e4d5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g3h4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e4e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2h3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- b2b3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e1e3. This:
- Develops the bishop to a more active position
- Controls central squares
- Prepares for potential castling
- Moves the bishop to safety away from potential threats
- Maintains pressure on the central pawns
- Is a flexible move that can lead to future development

Other moves either don't develop pieces or move pieces to less active positions. e1e3 is the only move that improves piece activity and central control.

```
e1e3

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on e3 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g1g2, moving the rook to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the current position's needs. d1e2 is tempting to defend the rook, but doesn't improve piece activity. c1d2 is a slow move. a1b1 is a slow move. e3d3 is a slow move. 

Therefore, the best move is:

g1g2

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a strong knight on c3, but it's currently blocked by the pawn on e4
- Black has a strong knight on c3, which is very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:

- f3e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves the knight to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d1e2, moving the queen to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity. d1e2 is a quiet move that improves the queen's position and prepares for future development.

After d1e2, the queen can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action when the position becomes more complex. Other moves don't improve piece activity as much.

```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:15:30,732 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.57s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is still in the center
- White has a strong knight on c3, but it's being attacked by the black knight on c3
- Black has a strong knight on c3, which is very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c3d5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c3b5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c3a4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c3d1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c3b1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g2g3: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g2h1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g2g1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g2f1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e2a6: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e2b5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e2c4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e2d3: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e2d2: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e2f1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e2e1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e2d1: Moves the knight to a less active position
- c1d2: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e4d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h2g3: Moves the knight to a less active position
- f2g3: Moves the knight to a less active position
- e4e5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h2h3: Moves the knight to a less active position
- b2b3: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a2a3: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- h2h4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- a2a4: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f2g3, which:
- Moves the knight to a more active position
- Removes the threat from the black knight on c3
- Helps to develop the king's safety
- Prepares to potentially castle later
- Is a quiet move that doesn't disrupt the position

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. f2g3 is the only move that improves piece activity and removes a threat.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on e3 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling key squares
- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could become dangerous later

3. Candidate moves to consider:

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e2f2, moving the king towards the action and potentially helping to defend the rook on e3. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the potential threat from the black knight on c3. e2f2 is a quiet move that improves king safety and prepares to potentially move the rook later if needed.

After e2f2, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the rook on e3 from potential attacks from the black knight on c3. This is a proactive move that improves piece safety and prepares for future developments.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:16:46,928 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.93s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on e3 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling key squares
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves knight to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves rook to a less active position
- e3c3: Moves rook to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves rook to a less active position
- e3e1: Moves rook to a less active position
- g2h1: Moves rook to a less active position

- f2d2: Moves rook to a less active position
- f2g1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f2f1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f2e1: Moves rook to a less active position
- c1d2: Moves bishop to a less active position
- a1b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- e4d5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- b2c3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e4e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2h3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- b2b3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2h4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a2a4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be b2c3, which:
- Moves the pawn to a more active position where it can support other pieces
- Helps to control the center
- Prepares to potentially exchange pawns in the future to reduce pressure on the king
- Is a quiet, solid move that improves piece activity and position

All other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve the position. b2c3 is the only move that improves the position of a piece and prepares for future development.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:18:28,832 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.58s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on f3 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling key squares
- White has a passed pawn on e4, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f3g5: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves rook to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves a central piece to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves a central piece to a less active position

- a2a3: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h2h4: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a2a4: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f2e2, moving the rook to a more active position where it can support the center and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity. e2 is a central, active square for a rook.

After f2e2, the rook can support the center, potentially participate in future action, and be ready to move to other active positions later. This is a quiet move that improves piece activity and prepares for future developments.

```
f2e2

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e2c4, trading off the active rook on e2 for a more passive rook on c4. This removes a potential threat to the king and simplifies the position, which could help White's king become more active later. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e2c4 is a proactive move that improves piece activity and removes a potential threat.

After e2c4, White can focus on improving king safety and piece activity in the next moves.

2025-08-02 13:20:41,230 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 7.75s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on c4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling key squares
- Black has a powerful queen on c5, which could become active later

3. Candidate moves to consider:

- a2a3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- h2h4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- a2a4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be b1b4, trading off the rook that's currently being attacked by the knight on c3. This removes a threat and improves the position of the rook. Other moves either don't improve the position or trade pieces that aren't under attack.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
b1b4
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

The most prudent move appears to be g2f2, trading off the rook that's threatening the king. This removes a potential future threat and improves the king's safety. Other moves either don't improve king safety or move pieces to less active positions. e3d3 is similar but doesn't address the king threat. f3g5 is a rook trade that doesn't help the king. c1a3 is a rook trade that doesn't help the king.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f2g2, trading off the pawns that are threatening the king's safety. This removes the potential for future attacks on the king and improves the king's safety. Other moves either don't improve king safety or move pieces to less active positions. e3d3 is a slow move that doesn't address the king safety issue. c1a3 is a slow move that doesn't address the king safety issue. f3g5 is a slow move that doesn't address the king safety issue.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f2g2
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:23:07,193 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.75s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook and bishop vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on g3, controlling key squares
- White has a passed pawn on c2, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- b4b7: Trading rooks, but leaves White's king exposed
- b4b6: Moving the rook to a less active position
- b4b5: Moving the rook to a less active position
- b4c4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- b4a4: Moving the rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moving the rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moving the rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moving the rook to a less active position
- f3g5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- f3e5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- f3h4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- f3d4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- f3d2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- f3g1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- f3e1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- e3d3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- e3e2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- e3e1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- g2h3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- g2f2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- g2h1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- g2g1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- g2f1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- c1a3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- c1d2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- c1b2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve king safety
- e4e5: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve king safety
- g3g4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve king safety
- h2h3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve king safety
- a2a3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve king safety
- h2h4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve king safety
- a2a4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve king safety

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g2h3, trading off the rook that's currently harassing the king. This removes a threat and allows the king to become more active in the future. Other moves either don't improve king safety or move pieces to less active positions. e3d3 is a solid move but doesn't address the king safety issue. c1a3 is a solid move but doesn't address the king safety issue. f3g5 is a solid move but doesn't address the king safety issue.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g2h3
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e4e5. This:
- Advances the central pawn to put pressure on black's position
- Opens lines for white's pieces
- Creates potential for future action
- Maintains tension in the center
- Is a proactive move that improves piece activity

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve the position. e4e5 is the only move that creates pressure and improves piece activity.

2025-08-02 13:24:02,055 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:24:27,466 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.69s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling key squares
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves:
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4c4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4a4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- h3g2: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3g5: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3h4: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3d4: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3d2: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3g1: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3e1: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- e3e4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- e3d3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- e3e2: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- e3e1: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- c1a3: Trading bishops, but doesn't improve position
- c1d2: Trading bishops, but doesn't improve position
- c1b2: Trading bishops, but doesn't improve position
- e5f6: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- c2d3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- e5e6: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- g3g4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- a2a3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- a2a4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be c2d3, trading off the central tension and improving the position of the rook on b4. This move:
- Removes a central tension point
- Improves the activity of the rook on b4
- Simplifies the position, which could help White's king become more active later
- Maintains pressure on the black knight on c3

Other moves either don't improve the position or trade pieces in a way that doesn't help development.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c2d3
```

- a2a4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d3c4, trading off the central tension and improving the position of the rook on b4. This removes a potential threat from the black knight on h6 and improves the activity of the white rook. Other moves either don't improve the position or trade pieces in a way that doesn't address the central tension.

After d3c4, the rook on b4 becomes more active and the central tension is reduced, which is a positive development for White's position.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:25:51,022 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.45s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is hard to dislodge
- White has a passed pawn on c4, but it's not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4a4: Moving rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moving rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moving rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moving rook to a less active position
- h3g2: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3g5: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moving knight to a less active position
- e3e5: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3e4: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- c1a3: Moving bishop to a less active position
- c1d2: Moving bishop to a less active position
- c1b2: Moving bishop to a less active position
- c4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- c4c5: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moving pawn to a less active position
- a2a3: Moving pawn to a less active position
- a2a4: Moving pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h3g2, moving the knight to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e3e5 is a passive move, while h3g2 is proactive.

After h3g2, the knight can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h3g2
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h2h3, which:
- Creates space for the king and pawns
- Prevents potential future ...h4 pushes by the black knight
- Maintains the integrity of the pawn structure
- Keeps all pieces active and ready to participate in future action

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. h2h3 is a quiet move that improves long-term position stability.

2025-08-02 13:28:01,029 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.08s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is hard to dislodge
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4a4: Moving rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moving rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moving rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moving rook to a less active position
- f3g5: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3h2: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moving knight to a less active position
- e3e5: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3e4: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2h2: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2f2: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2h1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2g1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2f1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- c1a3: Moving bishop to a less active position
- c1d2: Moving bishop to a less active position
- c1b2: Moving bishop to a less active position
- c4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- c4c5: Moving pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moving pawn to a less active position
- a2a3: Moving pawn to a less active position
- a2a4: Moving pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be c1a3, moving the bishop to a more active position where it can help defend the rook on b4 and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e3e5 is a natural move but doesn't improve piece activity. f3g5 is a natural move but doesn't improve piece activity. c4b5 is a natural move but doesn't improve piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
c1a3
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:29:35,194 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.20s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black's king is on e7, somewhat exposed
- White has passed pawns on c4, e3, h3, but they're not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- b4b5: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position

- a3c1: Moves bishop to a less active position
- h2g2: Moves king to a less active position
- h2h1: Moves king to a less active position
- h2g1: Moves king to a less active position
- c4b5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c4c5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h2g2, moving the king towards the action and potentially preparing to support the rook on b4 in the future. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. h2g2 is a quiet move that improves king safety and prepares for future action.

After h2g2, the king is closer to the center and potential threats from the rook on b4. Other moves don't address the need to improve piece activity or king safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h2g2
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:30:14,151 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:30:20,036 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.88s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is very active
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4a4: Moving rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moving rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moving rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moving rook to a less active position
- f3g5: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3h2: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moving knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moving knight to a less active position
- e3e5: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3e4: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moving pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Moving pawn to a less active position
- a3c1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2h2: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2f2: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2h1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2g1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g2f1: Moving pawn to a less active position
- c4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- c4c5: Moving pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Moving pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moving pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g2h2, which:
- Moves the pawn to a less active position, but
- Creates a potential future outpost for the king
- Avoids any potential future threats from the black knight on h6
- Keeps the rook on b4 active and defended

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. g2h2 is a quiet move that maintains the status quo while avoiding potential future threats.

After this, White can continue to improve piece activity later when the opportunity arises.

```
g2h2
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h2g2, which:
- Moves the pawn to a more active position
- Helps to solidify the king's position
- Prepares to potentially move the king to g3 later to help defend the pawns
- Is a quiet move that doesn't disrupt other pieces

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or move pawns that aren't under immediate threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h2g2

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:31:49,324 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.68s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is very active
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- b4b5: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves knight to a less active position
- e3e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves rook to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves rook to a less active position
- g2h2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2f2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2h1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2g1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2f1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c4b5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c4c5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g2h2, which:
- Moves the pawn to a less active position, but
- Creates a potential future outpost for the king
- Avoids any potential future attacks from the black knight on h6
- Keeps the rook on b4 active and defended

All other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity. g2h2 is a quiet move that maintains the status quo, but is the least vulnerable to future attacks.

```
g2h2

- Helps to solidify the king's position
- Prepares to potentially move the king to g3 later to help defend the pawns
- Is a quiet move that doesn't disrupt other pieces

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or move pawns to less active positions. h2g2 is the only move that improves the position of a pawn to a more active location.

2025-08-02 13:33:25,857 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.74s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is very active
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- b4b5: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves knight to a less active position
- e3e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2h2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2f2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2h1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2g1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g2f1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c4b5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c4c5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g2h2, which:
- Moves the pawn to a less active position, but
- Creates a potential future outpost for the king
- Prevents the black knight on h6 from becoming too active
- Maintains tension in the position
- Keeps other pieces active and ready to respond to threats

All other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the current tension in the position. g2h2 is a quiet move that maintains the status quo while keeping pieces active and ready to respond to future threats.

```
g2h2

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h2g2, which:
- Moves the pawn to a more active position
- Helps to solidify the king's position
- Prepares to potentially move the king to g3 later to help defend the pawns
- Is a quiet move that doesn't weaken any squares
- Maintains tension in the position

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't contribute to development. h2g2 is a simple, solid move that improves the position.

- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is very active

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g2h2, which:
- Moves the pawn to a less active position, but
- Creates a potential future threat to the black king
- Keeps the pawn structure solid
- Maintains pressure on the black king
- Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g2h2
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:35:30,344 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:35:35,404 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.06s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is hard to dislodge
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves:
- b4b5: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f3g5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves knight to a less active position
- e3e5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2g2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2h1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h2g1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c4b5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- c4c5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h2g2, which:
- Moves the pawn to a more active position
- Helps to solidify the king's position
- Prepares to potentially move the king to g3 later to help defend the pawns
- Is a quiet move that doesn't disrupt other pieces

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or move pawns that aren't under immediate threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h2g2
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is very active
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- b4b5: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves rook to a less active position

- c4c5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g2h2, which:
- Moves the pawn to a less active position, but
- Creates a potential future outpost for the king
- Keeps the pawn structure solid
- Avoids any potential future threats from the black knight on h6
- Maintains the rook's activity on the b-file

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity. g2h2 is a quiet move that maintains the status quo while keeping pieces active and safe.

After this, White can continue to improve piece activity later when the opportunity arises.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.

2025-08-02 13:36:47,717 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.23s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is exposed on h7
- White has a passed pawn on c4, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong knight on h6, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves:
- b4b5: Moves a rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves a rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves a rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves a rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f3g5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f3e5: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f3h4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f3d4: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f3d2: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f3g1: Moves a knight to a less active position
- f3e1: Moves a knight to a less active position
- e3e4: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves a bishop to a less active position
- h2g2: Moves a knight to a less active position
- h2h1: Moves a knight to a less active position
- h2g1: Moves a knight to a less active position
- c4b5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- c4c5: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h2g2, moving the knight to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity. h2g2 is a quiet move that improves piece activity and prepares for potential future threats from the black knight on h6.

After h2g2, the knight is better placed to defend the king and can potentially jump to f4 later to block the black knight's influence. Other moves don't address the key threat from the black knight.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h2g2
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is very active
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- b4b8: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b7: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b6: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position

- g3g4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g2h2, which:
- Trades off a potentially dangerous pawn on g2
- Removes a potential future threat from the black knight on h6
- Simplifies the position, which could help White's king become more active
- Maintains pressure on the black king

Other moves either don't improve the position or trade pieces that aren't threatening the king.

Therefore, the best move is:

2025-08-02 13:38:01,109 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.69s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's knight on f3 is well placed, but could be moved
- Black has a strong knight on h6, which is hard to dislodge
- White's king is safe but not very active

3. Candidate moves:
- b4b8: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b7: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b6: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4c4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4a4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- f3g5: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3e5: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3h4: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3d4: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3d2: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3g1: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- f3e1: Trading knights, but doesn't improve position
- e3e4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- e3d3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- e3e2: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- e3e1: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- a3b2: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- a3c1: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- h2g2: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- h2h1: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- h2g1: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- h3h4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- g3g4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h2g2, which:
- Trades off a potentially dangerous passed pawn on h3
- Improves the position of the king by removing a threat
- Simplifies the position, which could help White's king become more active
- Removes a potential future threat to the king

Other moves either don't improve the position or trade pieces that aren't threatening the king. h2g2 is the only move that directly addresses a potential threat to the king.

```
h2g2

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f3g5, trading off the active knight for a less active one, but removing a threat from the black knight on h6. This reduces pressure on the white king and improves the position of the white knight. Other moves either don't improve the position or trade pieces in a way that doesn't address the current threats.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f3g5

2025-08-02 13:39:32,282 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.41s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black has a rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is exposed on h7
- White has a passed pawn on h3, but it's not urgent
- White has a strong rook on e3, but it's blocked by the pawn

3. Candidate moves:
- g5h7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g5f7: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g5e6: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g5e4: Moves the knight to a less active position
- g5f3: Moves the knight to a less active position
- b4b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b6: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4c4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e3e4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e3f3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e3e1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g2h2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g2f2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g2h1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g2g1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g2f1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g5h7, capturing the rook on h7. This removes a threat from the black king and simplifies the position, which could help White's king become more active later. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. h3h4 is a slow move that doesn't address the current threats.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g5h7
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:40:15,476 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:40:20,701 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.22s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is exposed on h7
- White has a passed pawn on e3, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong rook on c4, which is very active

3. Candidate moves:
- h7f8: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7f6: Moves the knight to a less active position
- h7g5: Moves the knight to a less active position
- b4b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b6: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4c4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e3e4: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e3f3: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- g2h2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g2f2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g2h1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g2g1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g2f1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h7f6, moving the knight to a more active position where it can help defend the king and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e3e4 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. g2h2 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h7f6
```

2025-08-02 13:41:00,637 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.97s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on e5, controlling key squares
- White has passed pawns on c3, e3, h3, but they're not urgent

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f6g8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6d7: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves a rook to a less active position

- e3f3: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g2h2: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g2f2: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g2h1: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g2g1: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g2f1: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g2f2, moving the pawn to safety and potentially preparing to activate the king later. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e3e4 is a natural move but doesn't address the main issue of piece activity. h3h4 is a slow move. a3b2 is a slow move. b4b8 is a slow move. f6g8 is a slow move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g2f2
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:41:34,861 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.85s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on e5, controlling key squares
- White has passed pawns on c3, e3, h3, but they're not urgent

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f6g8: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6d7: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves knight to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves knight to a less active position
- b4b8: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b7: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b6: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b5: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4c4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves rook to a less active position
- e3e4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3f3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3d3: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves pawn to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves pawn to a less active position
- f2g2: Moves rook to a less active position
- f2e2: Moves rook to a less active position
- f2g1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f2f1: Moves rook to a less active position
- f2e1: Moves rook to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f2g2, moving the rook to a more active position where it can:
- Potentially capture the knight on e5 later
- Support the king's safety
- Be part of a future rook lift to attack the black king
- Maintain pressure on the black rook on b4

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. f2g2 is the only move that improves piece activity and prepares for future action.

```
f2g2

The most prudent move appears to be g2f2, moving the pawn to a more active position and potentially preparing to move the king later. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e3e4 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. h3h4 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. a3b2 is a slow move that doesn't improve piece activity. 

Therefore, the best move is:

2025-08-02 13:43:01,250 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.02s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook and bishop vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is exposed on g7
- White has a passed pawn on e3, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- f6g8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6e8: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6h7: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6d7: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6h5: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6d5: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6g4: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f6e4: Moves a rook to a less active position

- f2e2: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f2g1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f2f1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- f2e1: Moves a rook to a less active position
- h3h4: Moves a pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves a pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f2g2, moving the rook to a more active position where it can:
- Put pressure on the black king
- Potentially participate in future action
- Improve the rook's activity and position
- Prepare for potential future exchanges that could help White's king become more active

Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. f2g2 is the only move that improves a piece's activity.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook and bishop vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active

2025-08-02 13:44:01,098 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 2.47s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on f2, somewhat exposed
- Black's king is on g7, also exposed
- White has a passed pawn on e3, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong knight on d6, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves:
- f2g2: Moves king towards the action
- f2e2: Moves king to safety
- f2g1: Moves king to a less active position
- f2e1: Moves king to a less active position
- e3f3: Moves the passed pawn, but doesn't help the king

4. Threats to watch:
Black has a strong rook on c4, which could become active later. The knight on d6 is very strong.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f2e2. This moves the king towards the center and potential threats from the rook on c4. The other moves either don't help or move the king to less active positions. e3f3 is a slow move that doesn't address the king safety issue.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f2e2

2025-08-02 13:44:33,033 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.57s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on b4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on d6, controlling key squares
- White has passed pawns on c3, e3, but they're not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- b4b8: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b7: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b6: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4c4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4a4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e3e4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- e3f3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- e3d3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- a3b2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- a3c1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e2d2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e2e1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e2d1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- h3h4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- g3g4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e3e4, trading off the pawn to remove a potential future threat and improve the position of the rook on e3. Other moves either don't improve the position or trade rooks in a way that doesn't help. e3e4 is a simple, proactive move that improves the position of the rook and removes a potential future threat.

After e3e4, the rook on e3 becomes more active and the pawn structure is improved. This is a solid, proactive move that doesn't take risks but improves the position.

```
e3e4

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:45:57,774 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.11s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on e4 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on d6, controlling key squares
- White has passed pawns on c3, b3, etc., but they're not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- e4e7: Trading rooks, but leaves White's king exposed
- e4e6: Trading rooks, but similar issues
- e4e5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e4h4: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- e4g4: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- e4f4: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- e4d4: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- e4c4: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- b4b8: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- b4b7: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- b4b6: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- b4c4: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Trading rooks, but moves rook to a less active position
- e3d4: Trading pawns, but moves pawn to a less active position
- e3e2: Trading pawns, but moves pawn to a less active position
- e3d2: Trading pawns, but moves pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Trading pawns, but moves pawn to a less active position
- a3c1: Trading pawns, but moves pawn to a less active position
- h3h4: Trading pawns, but moves pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Trading pawns, but moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e3d4, trading off the pawn that's blocking the rook's activity. This removes a potential threat and allows the rook to become more active. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. e3d4 is a simple, proactive move that improves piece activity and removes a potential threat.

After e3d4, the rook on e4 can become more active, and the king can start moving towards the action. This is a slow, methodical improvement of position.

```
e3d4
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on e4, somewhat exposed
- Black's king is on g7, safer
- White has two legal moves that move the king (d4d5, d4c5, d4e3) and one that moves a pawn (e4e5)

3. Candidate moves:
- d4d5: Moves the king towards the action
- d4c5: Moves the king towards the action
- d4e3: Moves the king towards the action
- e4e5: Moves a pawn towards the action

4. Threats to watch:
Black has a strong rook on c5, which could become active later. The black knight on d6 is well placed.

5. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d4e3, moving the king towards the center and potential threats. The other king moves don't address the immediate threat. e4e5 is a pawn move that doesn't help the king safety.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d4e3

- a3c1: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- h3h4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- g3g4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h3h4, which:
- Trades off a pawn that's blocking the rook's activity
- Opens the h-file for the rook on h3
- Creates potential for future action against the exposed black king
- Maintains pressure on the black king's position
- Is a simple, quiet move that improves piece activity

Other moves either don't improve position or trade pieces that aren't blocking each other.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
h3h4
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```

2025-08-02 13:47:38,270 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.21s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is also safe
- White has a passed pawn on e4, but it's not very advanced
- Black has a strong knight on d6, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves:
- e4e7: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e4e6: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e4e5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e4g4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e4f4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position

- a3c1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- h4h5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- g3g4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e3f4, trading off the rooks that are currently blocking the king's escape. This would free up the king and allow White to potentially push their passed pawns later. Other moves either don't improve the position or trade rooks in less relevant ways.

After e3f4, White can focus on improving king safety and pushing their passed pawns when the opportunity arises.

```
e3f4

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on e4
- Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed
- White has a passed pawn on c3, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong knight on d6, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves:
- f4g5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f4g4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f4f3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f4e3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e4e5: Moves the king to a more active position

4. Threats to watch:
Black has a strong knight on d6, which could jump to e5 later, forking the king and rook.

5. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e4e5, moving the king towards the action and potentially preparing to capture the knight on d6 later, which could be a threat to the king. The other moves move rooks to less active positions. e4e5 is a proactive move that improves king safety and prepares to deal with potential threats.

After e4e5, the king is closer to the center and potential threats. The other moves don't address the immediate threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e4e5

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:48:38,426 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.10s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe on g3
- Black's king is on g7, also safe
- White has a passed pawn on h4, but it's not urgent
- White has a strong rook on e5, but it's blocked by the black knight on d6

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- e5e8: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e7: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e6: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5h5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5g5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5f5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5d5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5c5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5a5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- f4g5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- f4g4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- f4f3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- f4e3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b8: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b7: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b6: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4c4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4a4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- a3b2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- a3c1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- h4h5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- g3g4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f4g5, trading off the rook on f4 for the rook on g5. This removes a blocking piece from the white rook on e5, allowing it to become more active. Other moves either don't improve the position or trade rooks in a way that doesn't help development.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f4g5
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is also safe
- White has some active pieces, but no immediate threats
- Black has a strong knight on d6, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves:
- g5g6: Moves pawn up but doesn't improve piece activity
- g5h5: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g5g4: Moves pawn to a less active position
- g5f4: Moves pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h4h5, which:
- Moves the pawn to a more active position
- Creates pressure on the black pawn on h5
- Opens lines for the white rooks
- Maintains tension in the position
- Is a simple, proactive move that improves piece activity

All other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece activity. h4h5 is the only move that makes a positive contribution to piece activity and position improvement.

2025-08-02 13:50:35,629 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 6.00s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is also safe
- White has a passed pawn on h5, but it's not urgent
- White has a strong rook on e5, but it's blocked by the pawn on c3

3. Candidate moves:
- g5g6: Moves the rook up but doesn't improve position
- g5h4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g5g4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- g5f4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e6: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5f5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5d5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5c5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5b5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5a5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b6: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4c4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- h5h6: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be h5h6, advancing the passed pawn. This is a slow, methodical way to create pressure and potentially promote the pawn later. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. h5h6 is the only move that makes progress towards a potential promotion.

After h5h6, the pawn will eventually reach h7 and then h8, where it can promote. This is a long-term strategy, but it's the only move that creates real pressure and potential for future action.

h5h6

4. Threats to watch:
Black has a strong rook on c5, which could become active later. The knight on d6 is very strong, controlling key squares.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g5f6. This moves the king towards the center and potential threats, but away from the exposed position on g5. The other moves either don't address the threat or move the king to less active positions. g5f6 is proactive in moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pawns.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f6e7, moving the king towards the action to help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the king's safety. e5e8 is a tempting move to capture the rook, but the king is more important to move towards the action.

After f6e7, the king is closer to the center and can help defend the pawns. This is a slow, methodical move that improves king safety and position.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:52:38,226 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:52:43,011 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.78s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on e7, somewhat exposed
- Black's king is on g7, safer
- White has a passed pawn on e5, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves:
- e7d8: Moves king towards the action
- e7d7: Moves king to a less active position
- e7f6: Moves king towards the center and potential threats
- e7e6: Moves king to a less active position
- e5e6: Moves the pawn towards promotion
- e5h5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e5g5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e5f5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e5d5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e5c5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e5b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e5e4: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e5e3: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e5e2: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- e5e1: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b4b5: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b4c4: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b4b2: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- b4b1: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a3b2: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- a3c1: Moves the pawn to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
Black has a strong knight on c3, which could jump to d5 later, threatening the king.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e7f6, moving the king towards the center and potential threats from the knight on c3. This prepares to move the king to safety and potentially support the e5 pawn's promotion in the future. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions.

```
e7f6

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a king and pawns vs Black has a king, pawns and pieces. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on f6, somewhat exposed
- Black has a strong knight on e3, which is very active
- White has three legal moves: f6f7, f6e7, f6f5

3. Candidate moves:
- f6f7: Moves king up towards the action
- f6e7: Moves king towards the center and potential threats
- f6f5: Moves king down towards the pawns

4. Threats to watch:
Black has a strong knight on e3, which could jump to f5 later, forking king and pawns.
Black has pawns that could promote soon.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f6e7. This moves the king towards the center where the action is, and away from the potential fork threat from the knight on e3. f6f7 moves towards the rooks, but the rooks are not immediately threatening. f6f5 moves towards the pawns, but the pawns are not immediately threatening.

Therefore, the best move is:

2025-08-02 13:53:24,346 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 2.55s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a king and pawns vs Black has a king, pawns and pieces. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on e7, somewhat exposed
- Black has a strong knight on e3, which is very active
- White has three legal moves: e7e8, e7d8, e7e6

3. Candidate moves:
- e7e8: Moves king up, but into potential danger from black pieces
- e7d8: Moves king towards the action
- e7e6: Moves king towards the center and potential threats

4. Threats to watch:
Black has a strong knight on e3, which could jump to d5 or c4 later, threatening the king.
Black has pawns that could advance and create threats.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e7e6. This moves the king towards the center where the action is, but also away from the black knight's potential threats. The other moves move the king towards the black pieces or up the board where threats could develop. e6 is a safer square, closer to the pawns that could become dangerous later.

After e7e6, the king is in a better position to help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. The other moves don't address the immediate threat as well.

```
e7e6

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on e6, somewhat exposed
- Black's king is on g7, safer
- White has a passed pawn on c3, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong knight on e3, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves:
- e6f5: Moves king towards the action
- e5h5: Moves a rook to a less active position
- e5g5: Moves a rook to a less active position
- e5f5: Moves a rook to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e6f5, moving the king towards the action to help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the need to defend the pawns. g3g4 is a pointless pawn move. a3b2 is a pointless bishop move. b4b8 is a pointless rook move.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e6f5

2025-08-02 13:54:55,504 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.85s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on f5, somewhat exposed
- Black's king is on g7, safer
- White has a passed pawn on e5, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong knight on c3, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves:
- f5g6: Moves king towards the action
- f5f6: Moves king up
- f5g4: Moves king towards the center and potential threats
- e5e8: Moves the pawn up, but doesn't address king safety
- e5e7: Moves the pawn up
- e5e6: Moves the pawn up
- e5d5: Moves the pawn towards the action

- b4b1: Moves the rook towards the action
- a3b2: Moves the rook towards the action
- a3c1: Moves the rook towards the action
- g3g4: Moves the pawn towards the action

4. Threats to watch:
The black knight on c3 is very strong, and could jump to f6 later, threatening the white king.

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f5g4, moving the king towards the center and potential threats from the black knight on c3. This helps to:
- Get the king to safer squares
- Potentially block the knight's future jump to f6
- Start moving the king towards the action rather than away from it

Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces towards the action. f5g4 is the only move that starts moving the king towards the potential threat.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.

2025-08-02 13:55:21,303 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-08-02 13:55:26,956 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.65s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on e5 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on c1, which is very active

3. Candidate moves to consider:
- e5e8: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e7: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e6: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5h5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5g5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5f5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5d5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5c5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- e5e1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- g4h5: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- g4f5: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- g4h4: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- g4h3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- g4f3: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- b4b8: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b7: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b6: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b5: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4c4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4a4: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b3: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b2: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- b4b1: Trading rooks, but doesn't improve position
- a3b2: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position
- a3c1: Trading pawns, but doesn't improve position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be a3b2, trading off the vulnerable pawn on a3 for a safer position. This removes a potential threat from the black bishop on c1 and simplifies the position, which could help White's king become more active later. Other moves either don't improve the position or trade pieces in a way that doesn't address the key threat from the black bishop.

After a3b2, White can focus on improving piece activity and preparing to potentially push pawns later when the position is simpler.

```
a3b2
```

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g4f3, capturing the knight with the pawn. This removes a strong, active piece from the board and improves White's king safety.

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

2025-08-02 13:56:28,166 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 5.82s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is exposed on g7
- White has a passed pawn on c3, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong knight on e7, controlling key squares

3. Candidate moves:
- e5e6: Moves the rook up, but doesn't create threats
- e5h5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5g5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5f5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5d5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5c5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5b5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5a5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e2: Moves the rook to a less active position
- e5e1: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b8: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b7: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b6: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b5: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4c4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves the rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves the rook to a less active position
- f3g4: Moves the king to a less active position
- f3e4: Moves the king to a less active position
- f3g2: Moves the king to a less active position
- f3f2: Moves the king to a less active position
- f3e2: Moves the king to a less active position
- b2a3: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- b2c1: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- b2a1: Moves the bishop to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves the king to a less active position
- a2a3: Moves the pawn to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f3g4, moving the king towards the action and potentially preparing to capture the knight on e7 later. Other moves either don't improve piece activity or move pieces to less active positions. f3g4 is a proactive move that improves the king's position and prepares to capture the knight, which could be a future threat.

After f3g4, the king is closer to the center and the potential threat from the knight. This is a slow, methodical approach to improving piece activity and preparing to capture the knight when the opportunity arises.

```
f3g4
```

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be a2a3, which:
- Moves the pawn to a safer position
- Prepares to potentially push the a-pawn later
- Doesn't move any active pieces
- Maintains the status quo while improving piece safety

Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't improve piece safety. a2a3 is a quiet move that improves the position of a currently passive pawn.

After this, White can continue to improve piece positions gradually without taking unnecessary risks.

2025-08-02 13:57:39,523 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 4.66s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's rook on e5 is active, but could be vulnerable to attacks
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black has a strong knight on e1, which is very active

3. Candidate moves:
- e5h5: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5g5: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5f5: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5d5: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5c5: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5b5: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5a5: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5e4: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5e3: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5e2: Moves rook to a less active position
- e5e1: Moves rook to a less active position
- g4h5: Moves king to a less active position
- g4f5: Moves king to a less active position
- g4h4: Moves king to a less active position
- g4h3: Moves king to a less active position
- g4f3: Moves king to a less active position
- b4b8: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b7: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b6: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b5: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4c4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves rook to a less active position
- b2c1: Moves bishop to a less active position
- b2a1: Moves bishop to a less active position

4. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be g4f3, moving the king towards the action and potentially capturing the active black knight on e1. This would remove a strong piece and improve the king's position. Other moves either move pieces to less active positions or don't address the threat from the black knight.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
g4f3
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as Black.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4

You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.

Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is safe but not very active
- Black's king is exposed on g3

- b2c1: Moves bishop to a less active position
- b2a1: Moves bishop to a less active position
- g3g4: Moves king towards the action

4. Threats to watch:
Black's rook on e5 is very active and could become dangerous later.

5. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f3g4, moving the king towards the action to help defend the king and pawns. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. f3g4 is proactive in moving the king towards potential threats.

After f3g4, the king can help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action. Other moves don't improve piece activity or defense.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f3g4
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

2025-08-02 13:59:04,790 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 2.80s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a king and pawns vs Black has a king, pawns, and pieces. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on f3, somewhat exposed
- Black has a strong rook on c5, and other pieces that could become active
- White has passed pawns on c3, a3, etc., but they're not urgent

3. Candidate moves:
- f3g4: Moves king towards potential threats
- f3e4: Moves king towards the action
- f3e3: Moves king towards the center and potential threats
- f3g2: Moves king towards the action
- f3e2: Moves king towards the action

4. Threats to watch:
Black has a rook on c5 that could become active later, and a knight on e1 that could jump to f3 later.

5. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be f3e3. This moves the king towards the center where potential threats may arise, and away from the exposed position on f3. The other moves either don't address the threat or move the king towards the action. f3e3 is a proactive move to get the king to safer squares and potentially help defend pawns later.

After f3e3, the king is closer to the center and potential threats from black pieces. The other moves either don't help or move the king towards the action.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
f3e3
```

- d2e1: Moves king to a less active area
- d2d1: Moves king to a less active area
- d2c1: Moves king towards the rook

Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be d2e3. This moves the king towards the center and the potential threats from the black knight on e6. The other moves move the king to less active areas. d2c1 moves towards the rook, but the rook is not an immediate threat. d2e3 is proactive in moving the king towards the action to help defend the pawns and potentially participate in future action.

2025-08-02 14:00:15,332 - INFO - Raw response from White (qwen3-8b-grpo_2_blitz) (took 3.68s):
Let me analyze the position carefully:

1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.

2. Key features:
- White's king is on e3, somewhat exposed
- Black's king is on g7, safer
- White has a passed pawn on c2, but it's not urgent
- Black has a strong rook on c5, which is very active

3. Candidate moves:
- b4b8: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b7: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b6: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b5: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4c4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4a4: Moves rook to a less active position
- b4b3: Moves rook to a less active position
- e3e4: Moves king to a less active position
- e3d4: Moves king to a less active position
- b2c1: Moves bishop to a less active position
- b2a1: Moves bishop to a less active position

4. Threats to watch:
Black's rook on c5 is very active and could potentially capture the c3 pawn later.

5. Best move:
The most prudent move appears to be e3d4, moving the king towards the action and potentially helping to defend the pawns. Other moves either don't address the threat or move pieces to less active positions. e3d4 is a proactive move that improves the king's position and helps defend the pawns.

After e3d4, the king is closer to the rook on c5 and can help defend the pawns. Other moves don't improve piece activity or don't address the threat.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
e3d4
```

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

Note: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like "e2e4" or "g1f3", treating captures the same as regular moves without "x" or "+" symbols, and adds a letter like "q" for pawn promotion (e.g., "e7e8q").

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
Reminder of chess rules:
- Bishops move diagonally.
- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.
- Knights jump in an L-shape.
- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.
- Kings move one square in any direction.
- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.
