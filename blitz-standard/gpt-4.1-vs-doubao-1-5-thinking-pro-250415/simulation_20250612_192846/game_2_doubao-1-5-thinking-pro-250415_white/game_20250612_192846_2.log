2025-06-12 19:29:56,964 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position:**  
White has played 1.e4, the most popular opening move, controlling the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop.  
As Black, I must respond with a move that contests the center, develops a piece, or prepares to do so.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7e5** – The classical response, mirroring White's move, controlling the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop.
2. **c7c5** – The Sicilian Defense, an aggressive and popular response, immediately challenging White's center.
3. **e7e6** – The French Defense, solid and preparing d5.
4. **c7c6** – The Caro-Kann Defense, solid and preparing d5.
5. **d7d6** – The Pirc/Modern Defense, flexible but less direct.
6. **g8f6** – Alekhine's Defense, attacking the e4 pawn and inviting White to overextend.

**Analysis:**
- **e7e5** is the most classical, leading to open games and rapid development.
- **c7c5** (Sicilian) is the most combative and statistically successful at high levels, aiming for asymmetrical play and long-term counterplay.
- **e7e6** and **c7c6** are solid but less ambitious in the immediate fight for the center.
- **g8f6** is provocative but can lead to sharp play.

Given the urgency and the need to play for a win, **c7c5** (the Sicilian Defense) is the best choice. It avoids symmetrical positions, creates imbalances, and offers Black dynamic chances for victory.

**Final move:**
```
c7c5

Let's analyze the position:

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2

Move history: 1. e4 c5 2. d4

White has played the Smith-Morra Gambit, offering a pawn on d4 for rapid development and initiative. As Black, we must decide whether to accept the gambit or decline it.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c5xd4** (Accept the gambit): This is the main line. White will likely recapture with the knight (Nf3, then Nxd4), gaining rapid development. Black gets a pawn but must be careful not to fall behind in development.
2. **d7-d6** (Decline the gambit): Solid, but allows White to recapture on d4 with a pawn, leading to a standard Open Sicilian.
3. **e7-e6** (Decline, French structure): Also solid, but less ambitious.
4. **g8-f6** (Develop): Allows White to push e5, gaining space.
5. **b8-c6** (Develop): Also allows e5, but less problematic than Nf6.

**Analysis:**

- **Accepting the gambit (c5xd4):** This is the most principled and theoretically sound response. Black grabs the pawn and challenges White to prove compensation. The main line is 3...cxd4 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Nxd4, after which Black can continue with ...e6, ...Nf6, ...Qc7, and ...a6, aiming for solid development and counterplay.

- **Declining the gambit:** This is possible, but gives White a comfortable center and doesn't challenge White's opening idea.

- **Immediate development (Nf6, Nc6):** Both allow e5, which gives White space and initiative.

**Conclusion:**

The best move is to accept the gambit with **c5xd4**. This is the most critical test of White's idea and keeps Black in the game with chances for equality or more.

My move:

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3  
**Move history:** 1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. Nf3

**Current position:**
- White has played the Open Sicilian, and after 3.Nf3, Black is to move.
- Black has already captured on d4 with the c-pawn.
- White's knight is on f3, attacking the d4 pawn.
- White's e4 pawn is advanced, and White has a slight lead in development.

**Legal moves:**
- Defend the d4 pawn (with Nc6 or Nf6).
- Push d3 (but this gives up the pawn after Bxd3).
- Develop pieces (Nc6, Nf6, etc.).
- Other pawn moves (not optimal here).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nc6**: Develops a piece, defends d4, and prepares to continue normal Sicilian development.
2. **Nf6**: Develops a piece, attacks e4, but does not defend d4. White can play e5, attacking the knight.
3. **d3**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play Bxd3, regaining the pawn with development.
4. **e5**: Not possible, as the e-pawn is blocked.
5. **Other moves**: Not as relevant (queen moves, other knight moves, etc.).

**Deeper analysis:**
- **Nc6** is the main line in the Sicilian Defense, Open Variation. It develops a piece, defends the d4 pawn, and keeps the central tension.
- **Nf6** allows e5, which can be annoying for Black.
- **d3** gives up the pawn for no compensation.
- **Other moves** (queen moves, etc.) are not developing and do not help Black's position.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is **Nc6**. It is the main line, develops a piece, and defends the d4 pawn. This keeps Black in the game and avoids any immediate disadvantage.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-12 19:38:33,267 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.75s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4

**Move history:** 1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.Bc4

**It's Black to move.**

**Material:** Equal.

**Position:**
- White has a strong center and rapid development.
- Black's d4 pawn is advanced, but could become a target.
- White threatens to castle and develop rapidly.
- Black's development is lagging a bit (kingside minor pieces not yet developed).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **e7-e6**: Solid, supports d5, opens lines for Bf8.
2. **e7-e5**: Aggressive, but allows White to play Ng5, attacking f7.
3. **g8-f6**: Develops a piece, attacks e4.
4. **d7-d6**: Supports d4, but blocks the light-squared bishop.
5. **d7-d5**: Strikes in the center, but White can play exd5.
6. **d8-a5**: Checks, but White can block easily with Nc3.
7. **d8-c7**: Passive.
8. **d4-d3**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play Qxd3 or cxd3, gaining development.
9. **c6-e5**: Attacks c4 bishop, but White can retreat or exchange.

**Critical tactical considerations:**
- After 4...Nf6, White can play e5, attacking the knight.
- After 4...e6, White can play Nxd4, but then Qh4 (threatening Qxe4+) is not possible because White's queen is on d1.
- After 4...d6, White can play Nxd4, but then Nxd4, Qxd4, Nf6, and Black is fine.
- After 4...d5, White can play exd5, Na5, Bb5+ Bd7, dxc6 bxc6, and Black is okay but not better.

**Most solid and flexible move:**
- **e7-e6**: Prepares to develop the bishop, supports d5, and keeps the center solid.

**Alternative:**
- **g8-f6**: Develops a piece, but allows e5.

Let's check 4...Nf6 5.e5 d5 6.Bb5 Ne4 7.Nxd4 Bd7 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.O-O e6 and Black is okay, but White has more space.

**Conclusion:** The most solid and flexible move is **e7-e6**. It supports the center, prepares to develop the bishop, and keeps options open.

**Final move:**
```
e7e6

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5

**Move history:** e2e4, c7c5, d2d4, c5d4, g1f3, b8c6, f1c4, e7e6, f3d4

**It's Black to move.**

**Position assessment:**
- White has developed both bishops and a knight, and has a strong center with pawns on e4 and d4.
- Black has developed Nc6, and has played e6 and c5, but is behind in development.
- White's pieces are active, especially the bishop on c4 and knight on d4.
- Black's king is still in the center, and White is threatening to build up pressure quickly.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxd4**: Exchange knights. After Nxd4, Qxd4, White's queen is centralized, but Black can develop with tempo (e.g., Qf6 or Qb6).
2. **Nf6**: Develops a piece, attacks e4, but allows Nxc6, bxc6, and White can play e5.
3. **Bc5**: Develops a piece, attacks d4, but White can play Nxc6, bxc6, and then e5.
4. **Qb6**: Attacks d4 and b2, but White can defend easily.
5. **d5**: Strikes in the center, but e:d5, exd5, Bb5 pins the knight.
6. **a6** or **b5**: Not urgent, doesn't address the center.
7. **Be7**: Quiet development, but doesn't contest the center.

**Deep analysis:**

- **Nxd4** is the most forcing move. After Nxd4, Qxd4, Black can play Qf6, attacking d4 and f2, and developing with tempo. White can defend with Qe3 or Qd2, but Black gains time to develop.
- **Nf6** allows Nxc6, bxc6, e5, and White gets a strong initiative.
- **Bc5** also allows Nxc6, bxc6, e5, and White is better.
- **Qb6** is met by Nxc6, bxc6, and then White can play Nc3, and Black is still behind in development.

**Let's calculate Nxd4:**
1. Nxd4 Qxd4 Qf6 (attacking d4 and f2)
   - White can play Qe3 or Qd2.
   - After Qe3, Black can play b6, Bb7, and develop comfortably.
   - After Qd2, Black can play Bc5, and if c3, then Ne7, d5, etc.

This line exchanges one of White's active pieces and allows Black to catch up in development.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to exchange knights with Nxd4, reducing White's central control and allowing Black to develop with tempo.

**Final move:**

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/1B6/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6

**It's Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Both sides have all pieces except White is missing the d-pawn, Black is missing the c-pawn.
- White has a bishop on b5 pinning the knight on d7 (but there is no knight on d7, so it's just on b5).
- Black's knight on d4 is centralized and powerful.
- White's king is still on e1, and Black's king is on e8.

**Positional factors:**
- White threatens to castle kingside.
- Black's knight on d4 is very strong, attacking c2 and b5.
- White's bishop on b5 is not threatening anything immediate.
- Black's development is behind (kingside pieces are undeveloped).
- Black's e6 pawn is solid, but the light squares could become weak if not careful.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a6** (attacking the bishop, forcing it to decide)
2. **Nxb5** (knight takes bishop, but c2 is hanging after that)
3. **Qa5+** (check, but White can block with Nc3)
4. **Bc5** (developing, attacking f2)
5. **Nf6** (developing, but allows Bxc6)
6. **Qb6** (attacking b2 and maybe threatening Qxb2)
7. **e5** (pushes, but White can play Nc3)
8. **Bb4+** (check, but White can block with c3 or Nc3)

Let's analyze the most forcing options:

**1. a6**
- If Bxc6, dxc6, Black has the bishop pair and a strong center.
- If Ba4, Black can play b5 and then Bb7, gaining space and tempo.

**2. Nxb5**
- After Nxb5, White can play Nxb5, and Black loses the strong knight.
- Not ideal.

**3. Qa5+**
- White plays Nc3, defending everything.

**4. Bc5**
- Develops a piece, attacks f2, but White can castle.

**5. Nf6**
- Develops, but allows Bxc6, bxc6, and White can castle.

**6. Qb6**
- Attacks b2, but White can defend with Nc3.

**7. e5**
- White can play Nc3, attacking the knight.

**8. Bb4+**
- White can block with c3 or Nc3.

**Best move: a6**

This move forces the bishop to decide. If Bxc6, dxc6, Black has the bishop pair and a strong center. If Ba4, Black can play b5 and then Bb7, gaining space and tempo. This is the most logical and principled move, gaining time and improving Black's position.

**Final move:**
```
a6

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/1n6/1P2P3/8/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7

**Move history:** e2e4, c7c5, d2d4, c5d4, g1f3, b8c6, f1c4, e7e6, f3d4, c6d4, c4b5, d4b5, b2b4

**Black to move.**

**Material count:** Equal.  
**Positional features:**
- White has just played b2b4, attacking the knight on b5.
- Black's knight on b5 is attacked and must move or be defended.
- Black's development is lagging; kingside minor pieces are undeveloped.
- White has some space on the queenside, but Black can try to exploit the slightly overextended pawns.
- The c8-bishop is blocked by the e6-pawn.
- The queen is on d8, and the king is on e8.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Retreat the knight: b5c7, b5d6, b5d4, b5c3, b5a3
2. Counterattack: f8b4+ (check), f8c5, f8d6, f8e7
3. Develop: g8f6, g8e7, etc.
4. Pawn moves: d7d5, a7a5, etc.

**Critical analysis:**
- The knight on b5 is attacked. If it moves, where should it go?
    - b5c7: Retreats to safety, but blocks the queen and is passive.
    - b5d4: Attacks the queen on d1, but d4 is not available (occupied by White's pawn).
    - b5d6: Retreats, but d6 is not available (blocked by Black's own pawn).
    - b5c3: Attacks the a2-pawn, but c3 is not available (occupied by White's pawn).
    - b5a3: a3 is available, but it's on the edge and not very active.
- f8b4+ is a check, and White must respond. If c2c3, then Black can retreat the knight to c7 or a3. If White blocks with the bishop, Black can exchange.

**Let's calculate f8b4+:**
- 1...f8b4+ 2.c2c3 (only reasonable move)
- Now, the knight is still attacked, but now c3 is available for the knight.
- 2...b5c3
- Now, Black's knight is on c3, attacking the a2-pawn and threatening to fork the queen and rook if White is careless.
- If 3.Nxc3, then b4xc3, and Black has doubled White's pawns and opened the b-file.

Alternatively, after 1...f8b4+ 2.c3, 2...b5c3, 3.Nxc3, b4xc3, White's pawn structure is damaged, and Black has some compensation for the bishop pair.

Alternatively, after 1...f8b4+ 2.Bd2, Black can exchange bishops or retreat.

**Other moves:**
- Retreating the knight immediately is passive and loses initiative.
- Developing a piece (g8f6) loses the knight.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play 1...f8b4+, forcing White to respond and giving Black tactical chances.

**Final move:**
```
f8b4
```

Let's analyze the position:

**Position after 7...c3:**

- White pawns: a2, c3, d2, e4, f2, g2, h2
- Black pawns: a7, b5, d7, e6, f7, g7, h7
- White pieces: Ra1, Rf1, Bc1, Qd1, Ke1, N/A (knights gone), B/N/A (bishop on c1)
- Black pieces: Ra8, Qd8, Ke8, Bc8, Bb4, N/A (knights gone)
- White to move: No, it's Black to move.

**Material:**
- White: 2 rooks, 1 bishop, queen, 7 pawns
- Black: 2 rooks, 2 bishops, queen, 7 pawns

**Key features:**
- Black is up a minor piece for a pawn (White has only 1 bishop, Black has both bishops).
- Black's bishop on b4 is pinning the knight (but there is no knight on c3, so it's just on an open diagonal).
- White's center is strong, but Black is ahead in development and has the bishop pair.
- White's king is still in the center, and Black can try to open the position.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **...Ba5**: Retreats the bishop, keeps pressure on c3, but is passive.
2. **...Be7**: Retreats the bishop, prepares to castle.
3. **...Bc5**: Develops the bishop, attacks f2, but White can play Be3.
4. **...Qa5**: Develops the queen, attacks c3, and pins the c3 pawn to the king.
5. **...Nxc3**: No knight on b5.
6. **...Bxc3+**: Captures on c3, forcing bxc3, opening the b-file and doubling White's pawns.

**Tactical considerations:**
- ...Bxc3+ is very tempting, as it doubles White's c-pawns and opens the b-file, which could be used for an attack.
- After ...Bxc3+, bxc3, Black can play ...Qa5, attacking c3 and a2.
- White's king is still in the center, so opening the position is good for Black.

**Long-term strategy:**
- Black should aim to exploit the doubled c-pawns and the open b-file.
- The bishop pair is strong in open positions.
- White's king is still in the center, so Black should try to keep the center open and attack.

**Short-term tactics:**
- ...Bxc3+ is forcing and creates immediate weaknesses in White's camp.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
b4c3
```
This captures on c3, forces bxc3, and gives Black a long-term structural advantage and attacking chances.

2025-06-12 20:04:28,007 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.24s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/1n6/4P3/2b5/P2B1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 9

- Black to move.
- Material: Black is up a pawn (White has lost a pawn on c3).
- White's king is still in the center, but can castle kingside.
- Black's king is also in the center, but can castle both sides.
- Black's light-squared bishop on c3 is very strong, eyeing a1 and b2.
- White's knight is undeveloped, and White's queen is on d1.
- Black's knight on b5 is on the rim but can jump to d4 or c7.
- White's d2 bishop is awkwardly placed.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Bxa1**: Grabs the rook, but after White castles, the bishop may get trapped. Let's check: 9...Bxa1 10. Nc3 (threatening Nxb5 and Qxa1) and the bishop is trapped. So Bxa1 is not good.
2. **Qf6**: Develops the queen, eyes f2, but White can castle and defend.
3. **Bb2**: Threatens to exchange the bishop for the rook, but after 10. Nc3, White attacks the bishop.
4. **a5**: Defends the knight, but doesn't develop.
5. **Qb6**: Attacks the b4 pawn and keeps an eye on f2.
6. **Nf6**: Develops the knight, but doesn't address the bishop on c3.
7. **d5**: Opens the center, but White can respond with Bxc3 or exd5.
8. **Bxa1**: As above, loses the bishop after Nc3.

**Key tactical point:** The bishop on c3 is strong, but if it takes the rook, it gets trapped. So, the bishop should not take the rook yet.

**Best move:**
- **Bxa1** is a trap.
- **a5** defends the knight and prepares to retreat the bishop if needed.
- **Qb6** attacks b4 and keeps pressure.
- **d5** is interesting, but after exd5, White opens the center with Black's king still in the center.

**Let's check 9...a5:**
- 9...a5 defends the knight, so after 10. Nxc3, Black can play axb4 and the bishop can escape via b2 or a3.
- If White plays 10. Bxc3, then Nxc3 and Black is up a piece.

**Conclusion:** The best move is **a5**, defending the knight and keeping the bishop alive.

My move is:
```
a5
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/4p3/pn6/4P3/2B5/P4PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 10

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 1 Knight, 7 Pawns
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 7 Pawns

**Key features:**
- Black is up a pawn (White is missing a pawn compared to Black).
- Black's knight is on b5, White's bishop is on c3.
- White's king is on e1, has not castled yet.
- Black's king is on e8, can castle both sides.
- White's bishop on c3 is active, but Black's knight on b5 is well placed.
- Black's queenside pawns (a5, b5) are advanced, giving space and potential for play.
- White's queenside is underdeveloped (Nb1, Ra1).

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nxc3** (b5c3): Capture the bishop, forcing White to recapture with the queen or pawn. This would double White's c-pawns if bxc3, or allow Black to develop further if Qxc3.
2. **Qb6** (d8b6): Attack the b4 pawn and pressure the queenside.
3. **a4** (a5a4): Advance the a-pawn, cramping White's queenside further.
4. **d5** (d7d5): Strike in the center, but the e4 pawn is well protected.
5. **Nxa3** (b5a3): Attack the rook, but the knight could become trapped after Nxa3, Nxa3, Qe2.

**Tactical considerations:**
- Nxc3 is the most forcing move, removing White's strong bishop and potentially doubling White's c-pawns.
- After Nxc3, if bxc3, Black can play Qc7 or Qb6, targeting c3 and b4.
- If Qxc3, Black can play Qf6, attacking f2 and supporting d4.

**Strategic considerations:**
- Black is slightly better due to the extra pawn and more active queenside.
- White's king is still in the center, so keeping the center closed is preferable for Black.
- Trading pieces (especially the bishop on c3) reduces White's attacking chances.

**Calculation:**
1. b5c3 bxc3 dxc6 (if White tries to develop), Black can play Qc7, targeting c3.
2. b5c3 Qxc3 Nf6, Black develops and can castle kingside.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is **Nxc3** (b5c3), removing White's active bishop and potentially doubling White's pawns.

My move is:
```
b5c3
```

2025-06-12 20:13:20,451 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.66s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/4p3/p7/4P3/2N5/P4PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 11

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 8 pawns
- White: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 8 pawns

**Position:**
- Black's king is on e8, not yet castled.
- White's king is on e1, not yet castled.
- White's pieces are more active, especially the knight on c3 and the queen on d1.
- Black's development is lagging. The kingside knight and bishop are undeveloped.
- Black's queenside pawns are advanced (a5), but White has no immediate threats.
- The center is open, so king safety is paramount.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g8f6**: Develops the knight, attacks e4, prepares to castle kingside.
2. **d8a5**: Not legal.
3. **d8f6**: Develops the queen, but blocks the knight.
4. **e8f8**: King move, but unnecessary.
5. **e6e5**: Strikes at the center, but White can reply Nb5 or Qd6.
6. **a5a4**: Gains space, but not urgent.
7. **g8e7**: Develops the knight, but less active than f6.
8. **d7d5**: Central break, but e5 square is weak.

**Deep analysis:**
- **g8f6** is the most natural move. It develops a piece, attacks e4, and prepares to castle. If White plays Qd6, Black can play Qe7 or Qe8.
- **e6e5** is tempting, but after Nb5, White threatens Nc7+ and Nd6+.
- **d7d5** is possible, but after exd5 exd5, White can play Nxd5, and Black's queen is attacked.
- **a5a4** is slow and does not address development or king safety.

**Tactical checks:**
- No immediate threats from White.
- Black must develop and prepare to castle.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to develop the kingside knight to f6, attacking e4 and preparing to castle.

My move:
```
g8f6
```

2025-06-12 20:16:55,782 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.50s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqk2r/1p1p1ppp/4pn2/p3P3/8/2N5/P4PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 12

**Material count:**
- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, Knight, 7 pawns
- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, Knight, 7 pawns

**White's last move:** e4-e5 (attacking the knight on f6)

**Immediate threats:**
- White is attacking the knight on f6 with the pawn.
- If the knight moves, White may try to play Qd6, threatening mate or winning material.
- The e5 pawn is advanced and could become dangerous.
- Black's king is still in the center, but can castle kingside.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Nd5** (f6-d5): Retreats the knight, attacks the c3 knight, and keeps the center under control.
2. **Ng8** (f6-g8): Retreats the knight, but is very passive.
3. **Ng4** (f6-g4): Attacks the e5 pawn, but White can play Qxg4.
4. **Ne4** (f6-e4): Sacrifices the knight for two pawns, but after Nxe4, Nxe4, Qd4, Black is down material.
5. **O-O** (e8-g8): Castles, but leaves the knight hanging on f6.
6. **d5** (d7-d5): Blocks the e5 pawn, but White can play exf6.

Let's look at the most natural move: **Nd5**.

- 12...Nd5 attacks the c3 knight and keeps the center under control.
- If White plays Nxd5, exd5, Black has a strong center and the e5 pawn is blockaded.
- If White plays Qd4, Black can play Nxc3, Qxc3, Qg5, and is fine.

Other moves:
- 12...Ng8 is too passive.
- 12...Ng4 is met by Qxg4.
- 12...Ne4 is a piece sacrifice for insufficient compensation.
- 12...O-O loses a piece.

**Conclusion:** The best move is **Nd5** (f6-d5), attacking the c3 knight and blockading the center.

My move is:
```
f6d5

2025-06-12 20:20:40,918 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.59s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bqk2r/1p1p1ppp/4p3/p2NP3/8/8/P4PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 13

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 7 pawns
- White: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 7 pawns

**Position:**
- White's knight is on d5, very advanced and centralized.
- Black's king is still in the center, but can castle kingside.
- White's pieces are not yet coordinated for a direct attack.
- Black's bishop on c8 is undeveloped, but can be developed soon.
- Black's queenside pawns are advanced (a5), but White has no immediate threats.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Castling kingside (O-O / e8g8):** This is the most natural move, getting the king to safety and connecting the rooks.
2. **e6xd5:** Captures the knight, but after exd5, White can recapture with the queen or pawn, opening the e-file and possibly giving White some initiative.
3. **d8g5 / d8h4:** Queen moves, but there is no immediate threat.
4. **d8c7:** Defends the e5 pawn and keeps an eye on the queenside.
5. **a5a4:** Pushes the pawn, but doesn't address king safety.
6. **b7b6:** Prepares to develop the bishop, but again, king safety is paramount.

**Tactical considerations:**
- If Black castles, White may play Qg4 or Qd4, but there is no immediate threat.
- If Black plays e6xd5, White can play Qxd5, threatening the rook on a8 and possibly Qxg7.

**Strategic considerations:**
- King safety is critical.
- Black is not under immediate threat, but White's knight on d5 is strong.

**Best move:**
Castling kingside (e8g8) is the safest and most logical move. It gets the king to safety, connects the rooks, and prepares to contest the e-file if it opens.

**Final move:**
```
e8g8
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** r1bq1rk1/1pNp1ppp/4p3/p3P3/8/8/P4PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 14

**White's last move:** Nc7

**Material count:**
- Black: Rooks (a8, f8), Queen (d8), Bishop (c8), pawns (a5, b7, d7, e6, f7, g7, h7), King (g8)
- White: Rooks (a1, h1), Queen (d1), Knight (c7), pawns (a2, e5, f2, g2, h2), King (e1)

**Key features:**
- White's knight on c7 is very active, attacking both a8 and e6.
- Black's bishop is undeveloped on c8.
- Black is down in material (White has an extra pawn and a very active knight).
- Black's a5 pawn is under no immediate threat.
- White threatens to capture the rook on a8 or the pawn on e6.

**Immediate threats:**
- Nc7xa8 wins the exchange (rook for knight).
- Nc7xe6 attacks the queen and rook, and threatens a fork.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Qxc7**: Captures the knight, but White's queen is on d1, so not possible.
2. **Rb8**: Defends the rook, but after Nc7xe6, White wins material.
3. **Qxc7**: Not possible.
4. **d7d6**: Kicks the knight, but after exd6, White is up a pawn and still threatens the rook.
5. **Ra7**: Moves the rook, but then Nc7xe6 attacks the queen and rook.
6. **Qxc7**: Not possible.
7. **Qh4**: Threatens mate on f2, but White can defend easily.
8. **a4**: Not relevant.
9. **f6**: Not relevant.

**Best defensive move:**
- The only way to avoid losing the exchange is to move the rook. But after Ra7, Nc7xe6 attacks the queen and rook, so Black loses more material.
- Alternatively, **Qxc7** is not possible.
- **d7d6** is a candidate, but after exd6, the knight is still on c7 and the rook is still hanging.
- **Rb8** is a candidate, but after Nc7xe6, White wins the exchange and attacks the queen.

**Is there any tactical resource?**
- **Qxc7** is not possible.
- **Qh4**: Threatens mate on f2, but White can play Qe2 or Qd4 to defend.
- **Qg5**: Threatens mate on g2, but White can defend.
- **Qxc7** is not possible.

**Desperation:**
- The only way to avoid losing the rook is to play **Qxc7**, but that's not possible.
- **a4** is not useful.
- **d7d6** is the only move that attacks the knight and tries to get some play.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is **d7d6**, attacking the knight and opening lines for the bishop. If White plays exd6, then Qxd6 and Black can try to get some play.

**Final move:**
```
d7d6
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** N1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/3pp3/p3P3/8/8/P4PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 15

**White's last move:** Nc7-a8

**Material count:**
- Black: Queen, 2 rooks, 1 bishop, 7 pawns
- White: Queen, 2 rooks, 1 knight (on a8), 7 pawns

**Key features:**
- White's knight is stranded on a8 and is currently trapped. It cannot escape because b6, c7, and b7 are all controlled by Black's pawns or pieces.
- Black is up a piece for a pawn (White is effectively down a piece, as the knight on a8 is lost).
- No immediate threats from White.
- Black's king is castled and safe.
- White's king is on e1, not yet castled, and the queens are still on the board.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d8a8** — Captures the trapped knight immediately.
2. **d8c7** — Prepares to capture the knight next move, but less direct.
3. **d8g5** — Attacks g2, but White can defend easily.
4. **d6e5** — Opens the bishop, but not urgent.
5. **a5a4** — Expands on the queenside, but not urgent.
6. **b7b6** — Prepares to develop the bishop, but not urgent.

**Analysis:**
- The knight on a8 is trapped and cannot escape. Capturing it immediately with the queen (d8a8) is the most direct way to convert the material advantage.
- There are no tactical tricks for White after Qxa8.
- After Qxa8, Black will be up a full piece with no compensation for White.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the knight immediately and consolidate the material advantage.

**Final move:**
```
d8a8
```

g8h8, f8e8, d8e8, d8e7, d8d7, d8c7, d8f6, d8b6, d8g5, d8h4, c8d7, d6e5, h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, b7b6, d6d5, a5a4, h7h5, g7g5, f7f5, b7b5

**Key features:**
- White's knight is on a8, but Black cannot capture it right now.
- White's king is still in the center.
- Black has a spatial advantage and can press on the queenside or centralize pieces.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d8a8** — Illegal (not available).
2. **d8c7** — Queen attacks the knight on a8, threatening to capture it next move. This is a direct threat and forces White to respond.
3. **d8e7** — Queen centralizes, but less direct.
4. **d8b6** — Queen attacks b2 pawn, but White can defend.
5. **d6e5** — Opens the bishop, but not urgent.
6. **a5a4** — Expands on the queenside, but not urgent.

**Best move:**
- **d8c7** directly attacks the knight on a8, which is currently trapped. White cannot defend it, so Black will win a piece next move.

**Final move:**
```
d8c7
```

2025-06-12 20:36:00,626 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 10.10s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2b2rk1/1pN2ppp/3pp3/p3P3/8/8/P4PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 16

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook (f8), Rook (a8), Bishop (c8), Queen (c7), 6 pawns (a5, b7, d6, e6, f7, g7, h7), King (g8)
- White: Rook (a1), Rook (h1), Bishop (none), Queen (d1), Knight (c7), 6 pawns (a2, e5, f2, g2, h2, b4), King (e1)

**Key features:**
- White's knight on c7 is very strong, attacking both the a8 rook and e6 pawn.
- Black's queen on c7 is defending the rook on a8.
- White threatens to win material with Nxa8.
- Black's bishop on c8 is undeveloped.
- Black's king is relatively safe, but White's initiative is growing.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **d6xe5**: Captures White's advanced pawn, but allows Nxa8, losing the exchange (rook for knight).
2. **a5xb4**: Captures a pawn, but White can play Nxa8, again losing the exchange.
3. **b7b6**: Defends the a5 pawn, but does not solve the threat to the a8 rook.
4. **Bb7**: Not possible.
5. **Rd8**: Not possible.
6. **Qxc7**: Not possible.
7. **f8d8**: Moves the rook out of attack, but then White can play Nxa8, and after Qxa8, Black loses the exchange.
8. **f8e8**: Same as above.
9. **c8d7**: Develops the bishop, but does not defend the rook.
10. **g8h8**: King move, does not help.

**Best move analysis:**

The main issue is the threat of Nxa8, winning the exchange. Is there any way to avoid this? Let's check:

- **If f8d8 or f8e8**: White plays Nxa8, and Black can recapture with the queen, but still loses the exchange.
- **If c8d7**: White plays Nxa8, same issue.
- **If d6e5**: White plays Nxa8, same issue.
- **If b7b6**: White plays Nxa8, same issue.
- **If a5a4**: White plays Nxa8, same issue.

Is there any tactical resource? Let's check for tactics:

- **If d6xe5**: White plays Nxa8, Black plays Qc3+ (forking king and rook), but White can block with Qd2 or Qd2d2, so no gain.

- **If Qxc7**: Not possible.

- **If f8d8**: White plays Nxa8, Black plays Qc3+ (forking king and rook), but White can block with Qd2.

- **If f8e8**: Same as above.

Is there any way to trap the knight after Nxa8? Let's see:

- After Nxa8, Black can play Qc3+.
- White plays Qd2, Black plays Qxa1+, White plays Ke2, but Black has no follow-up.

So, Black is going to lose the exchange no matter what.

**What about counterplay?**

- **d6xe5**: Opens the center, but White's king is still in the center. Maybe Black can get some play.

- **a5xb4**: Opens the a-file, but White's knight is still threatening the rook.

- **b7b6**: Defends the a5 pawn, but does not help.

- **h7h6, g7g6, f7f6**: Pawn moves, do not help.

**Conclusion:**

Since Black is going to lose the exchange, the best course is to open the center and try to get counterplay against White's king, which is still in the center and not castled.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d6e5
```

This opens the center, attacks White's e5 pawn, and tries to create counterplay.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 2bQ1rk1/1pN2ppp/4p3/p3p3/8/8/P4PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 17

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- White: Queen (d8), Knight (c7), Rook (a1, h1), King (e1), 5 pawns (a2, f2, g2, h2, g3)
- Black: Queen (none), Bishop (c8), Rook (f8), King (g8), 6 pawns (a5, b7, e6, f7, g7, h7)

**White's threats:**
- White's queen is on d8, deep in Black's position, and the knight on c7 is also very active.
- White threatens to invade the 8th rank (e.g., Qe8+), and possibly take on a5 or b7.
- Black's king is relatively safe for now, but White's pieces are very active.

**Black's options:**
Legal moves: g8h8, f8e8, f8d8, c8d7, h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, b7b6, e5e4, a5a4, h7h5, g7g5, f7f5, b7b5

Let's consider the most urgent threats and candidate moves:

1. **Defend against Qe8+**  
   Qe8+ is not immediately mate, but after Rxe8, Nxe8, White wins the exchange and remains up material.  
   However, after Qe8+, Rxe8, Nxe8, Black can play Kf8 and the knight is trapped. But White can play Nd6, forking e8 and b7.

2. **f8e8**  
   This move covers the e8 square, preventing Qe8+ and also connects the rooks (if the other rook was on h8). But White can play Qxa5, winning a pawn.

3. **c8d7**  
   Developing the bishop, but doesn't address the threat of Qe8+.

4. **f8d8**  
   This move attacks the queen on d8, forcing it to move. After Qe7, Rd7, White's queen is forced away, but White can play Qe8+ anyway.

5. **g8h8**  
   King sidestep, but doesn't address the threats.

6. **a5a4**  
   Pushes the pawn, but doesn't address the threats.

7. **b7b6**  
   Defends the a5 pawn, but White can play Qe8+ anyway.

8. **e5e4**  
   Pushes the pawn, but doesn't address the threats.

**Key line to analyze:**

- If 1...f8e8 2. Qxa5 (White grabs a pawn)
- If 1...f8d8 2. Qe8+ Rxe8 3. Nxe8 (White wins the exchange, but the knight is trapped after Kf8)

But after 1...f8d8, White's queen is attacked and must move. Let's see:

- 1...f8d8 2. Qe7 (only safe square) Rd7 3. Qe8+ Rxe8 4. Nxe8 Kf8 5. Nxg7 Kxg7

But after 1...f8d8, White could also play Qxa5, but then b6 traps the queen.

**Let's check 1...f8d8 2. Qxa5 b6 3. Qe5 (only square) Ra7**

But after 1...f8d8, White's queen is under attack and has to move. If it goes to e7, then Rd7 attacks it again. If it goes to a5, then b6 traps it.

**Therefore, 1...f8d8 is a strong move, attacking the queen and possibly trapping it.**

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
f8d8
```

2025-06-12 20:44:36,545 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.88s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Position after 17...Re8:**
- White: King on e1, rook on a1 and h1, knight on e8, pawns on a2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black: King on g8, rook on d8, bishop on c8, pawns on a5, b7, e5, f7, g7, h7.

**Material:**
- Black is up a bishop for a pawn.
- White's knight on e8 is very active and attacks the rook on d8 and the bishop on c8.
- Black's rook on d8 is attacked and must move or be defended.

**Threats:**
- White threatens to win material with Nxc7 or Nf6+ (forking king and rook).
- If Black plays ...Rxe8, White can play Nc7, attacking the rook and bishop.
- If Black plays ...Bd7, White can play Nc7, attacking the rook and bishop.
- If Black plays ...Kf8, White can play Nc7, attacking the rook and bishop.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **Rxe8**: After Rxe8, White can play Nc7, attacking the rook and bishop. Black can play Rd8, but after Rd1, White is very active.
2. **Bd7**: Defends the rook, but White can play Nc7, attacking the rook and bishop.
3. **Kf8**: Moves the king, but White can play Nc7, attacking the rook and bishop.
4. **a4**: Not relevant, as the immediate threat is on the rook and bishop.
5. **g8f8**: King to f8, but White can play Nc7.

**Best move:**
- The only move that avoids immediate material loss is **Bd7**, defending the rook and preparing to recapture on e8 if needed.
- After Bd7, if White plays Nf6+ (fork), Black can play gxf6, and the rook is defended.
- If White plays Nc7, Black can play Nxc7, and the rook is still defended.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to defend the rook with the bishop.

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 3r2k1/1p1b1ppp/4pN2/p3p3/8/8/P4PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 19

**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Black: Rook (d8), Bishop (d7), 6 pawns (a5, b7, e5, f7, g7, h7), King (g8)
- White: Rook (a1), Rook (h1), Knight (f6), 5 pawns (a2, f2, g2, h2, e5), King (e1)

**White threats:**
- The knight on f6 is very strong, attacking d7 and threatening to jump to squares like g4 or e4.
- White has both rooks and the king is safe.
- White's next move could be Rd1, targeting the pinned bishop on d7.

**Black's options:**
Legal moves: g8h8, g8f8, g7f6

Let's analyze each:

1. **g8h8**: King to h8. This move does nothing to address the threat to the bishop on d7. White can play Rd1, pinning and winning the bishop.

2. **g8f8**: King to f8. Same as above, doesn't address the threat.

3. **g7f6**: Pawn takes knight on f6. This is the only move that saves the bishop, as the knight is attacking d7 and is a powerful piece. After gxf6, White can play Rd1, but now the bishop is defended.

**Tactical check:**
- If 1... gxf6 2. Rd1, Black can play Ke7, defending the bishop.
- White's rooks are not yet coordinated for a direct attack.
- Black is down in material (White has two rooks vs Black's rook and bishop), but after gxf6, Black's bishop is safe, and White's attack is blunted.

**Conclusion:**
The only move that doesn't lose material immediately is **g7f6**.

**Final move:**
```
g7f6

2025-06-12 20:52:01,134 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.51s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**Position after White's last move (20. Rd1):**

- Material: Black is up an exchange (rook for bishop), but White has a passed a-pawn and some activity.
- Black's king is on g8, relatively safe. White's king is on e1, not yet castled.
- Black's rook is on d8, bishop on d7, pawns on a5, b7, e5, f6, h7, h5.
- White's rook is on d1 and h1, pawns on a2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black to move.

**Legal moves:**
g8h8, g8f8, g8g7, d8f8, d8e8, d8c8, d8b8, d8a8, d7e8, d7c8, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4, h7h6, b7b6, f6f5, e5e4, a5a4, h7h5, b7b5

**Candidate moves and analysis:**

1. **d8b8** (Rook to b8)
   - Threatens b2 pawn, supports b7 pawn, and eyes b2 for possible invasion.
   - White may try to play bxa5, but then Rb2 is strong.
   - If White plays a4, then Bxa4 is possible.

2. **d8a8** (Rook to a8)
   - Defends the a5 pawn, but is passive.
   - White may play Rd7, attacking the bishop and threatening to invade.

3. **d7c6** (Bishop to c6)
   - Centralizes bishop, but doesn't create immediate threats.

4. **a5a4** (Pawn to a4)
   - Fixes White's a2 pawn, but White can play Rd7, attacking bishop.

5. **f6f5** (Pawn to f5)
   - Gains space, but doesn't address White's threats.

6. **h7h6** (Pawn to h6)
   - Luft for king, but not urgent.

7. **d8e8** (Rook to e8)
   - Eyes e-file, but White's king is on e1, so not much pressure.

8. **d7b5** (Bishop to b5)
   - Attacks rook on d1, but White can play Rxd8+ Rxd8, and then a4.

**Most promising:**
- **d8b8** is the most active, attacking b2 and preparing to invade on the second rank. If White tries to defend with Rb1, then Bc6 increases pressure.

**Sample line:**
20...Rb8 21. bxa5 (if White grabs the pawn) Rb2 22. Rd2 Rb1+ 23. Rd1 Rxd1+ 24. Kxd1 Bc6, and Black is very active and up material.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
d8b8
```

2025-06-12 20:53:24,383 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.28s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 1r4k1/1p1R1p1p/4pp2/p3p3/8/8/P4PPP/4K2R b K - 0 21

- Black to move.
- Material: Black is down an exchange (rook for bishop/knight), but White's rook on d7 is very active, and White's king is relatively safe.
- Black's king is a bit exposed, but not immediately under threat.
- White threatens to double rooks on the 7th rank (Rd7-d7, Rh1-d1), which could be dangerous.
- Black's rook on b8 is active on the open file, but not attacking anything concrete.
- Black's pawn structure is solid, but White has more activity.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **b8b1+**: Not legal (no rook on b1).
2. **b8b4**: Not legal (rook on b8, but b4 is not empty).
3. **b8b5**: Not legal (rook on b8, but b5 is not empty).
4. **b8a8**: Not legal (rook on b8, but a8 is not empty).
5. **b8c8**: Rook to c8, defending the 7th rank.
6. **b8d8**: Rook to d8, challenging the rook on d7.
7. **b8e8**: Rook to e8, defending the e6 pawn.
8. **b8f8**: Rook to f8, defending the f6 pawn.
9. **g8h8**: King to h8, sidestepping any checks.
10. **g8f8**: King to f8, centralizing but possibly walking into checks.
11. **g8g7**: King to g7, but then White can double rooks.
12. **h7h6**: Pawn move, giving luft.
13. **h7h5**: Pawn move, but doesn't do much.
14. **b7b6**: Pawn move, but weakens c6.
15. **b7b5**: Pawn move, but White can play a4.
16. **f6f5**: Pawn move, but weakens e6.
17. **e5e4**: Pawn move, but White can play f3.

**Critical threats:**
- White may double rooks on the 7th rank (Rd1-d7).
- White may play Ke2, centralizing the king.
- Black needs to defend the f6 pawn and avoid passive defense.

**Best Candidate Moves:**
- **b8d8**: Offers a rook trade, which would relieve pressure. If White trades, Black's king becomes more active.
- **b8c8**: Defends the 7th rank, but is passive.
- **b8e8**: Defends e6, but White isn't threatening e6 directly.
- **g8h8**: Sidesteps, but doesn't address the rook activity.

**Analysis of b8d8:**
- If 21...Rb8-d8 22.Rd1xd8+ Rxd8, White's rook is off the 7th, and Black can try to activate the king.
- If White refuses the trade, Black can play h6, b6, or try to activate the king.

**Analysis of b8c8:**
- Passive, but keeps the rook on the 7th rank.

**Analysis of b8f8:**
- Defends f6, but White can double rooks.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is **b8d8**, offering a rook trade to relieve pressure and simplify into a more manageable endgame.

My move:
```
b8d8

2025-06-12 20:57:43,234 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.96s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 6R1/1p3pkp/4pp2/p3p3/8/8/P4PPP/4K2R b K - 2 23

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on g7, pawns on a5, b7, e6, f6, h7
- White: King on e1, rook on h8, pawns on a2, f2, g2, h2

**White's threats:**
- White is threatening Rh8 to h7+, which would be check, and after Kxh8, White can play f2-f4, trying to break through on the kingside.
- White's rook is very active and can invade the 7th rank.
- Black's king is somewhat exposed.

**Black's options:**
- Only two legal moves: g7g8 and g7h6.

Let's analyze both:

1. **g7g8**: King moves to g8. This allows White to play Rook h8 to h7, which is check. After Kf8 (forced), White can play Rxb7, winning a pawn and invading the 7th rank. This is dangerous for Black.

2. **g7h6**: King moves to h6. This avoids the check from Rh7+. White can try to invade with Rook to b8 or h8, but there is no immediate check. The king is a bit exposed, but White has no immediate way to exploit it.

**Deeper analysis:**

- After **g7h6**, White can try Rook to b8, attacking the b7 pawn. If White plays Rb8, Black can play b7-b6, defending the pawn. White can try Rxb7, but then Black can play Kg6, and the king is relatively safe.

- After **g7g8**, White plays Rh7, and after Kf8, Rxb7, and White is invading.

**Conclusion:**

**g7h6** is the best move. It avoids the check and keeps the king relatively safe. Black can defend the b7 pawn with b6 if needed, and White has no immediate breakthrough.

**Final move:**
```
g7h6
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1p3p1p/4ppRk/p3p3/8/8/P4PPP/4K2R b K - 4 24

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on h6, pawns on a5, b7, e6, f7, h7
- White: King on e1, rook on g6, rook on h1, pawns on a2, f2, g2, h2

**White's threats:**
- White is threatening Rg6 to g8#, which is mate unless Black covers g8 or gives the king an escape square.
- White's rook on g6 is very active, and White's king is safe.
- Black's king is exposed on h6.

**Legal moves:**
- h6g6 (captures the rook, but White will recapture with the h-pawn, opening the h-file for White's rook, and Black's king will be exposed)
- h6h5 (moves the king to h5, but White can play g4+ and after ...Kxg4, h3 is coming, and Black's king is in a mating net)
- h7g6 (pawn takes rook, but then h2xg3 is possible, and Black's king is still exposed)
- f7g6 (pawn takes rook, but then h2xg3 is possible, and Black's king is still exposed)

Let's analyze each move:

1. **h6g6**: King takes rook. White plays h2xg3, and now Black's king is on g6, White's rook is on h1, and White has a passed h-pawn. Black's king is still exposed, and White can bring the rook to h8 or h4 with check. This looks dangerous for Black.

2. **h7g6**: Pawn takes rook. White can play h2xg3, and Black's king is still on h6. White can play Ke2-f3 and bring the rook to h8. Black's king is still exposed.

3. **f7g6**: Pawn takes rook. White can play h2xg3, and Black's king is still on h6. White can play Ke2-f3 and bring the rook to h8. Black's king is still exposed.

4. **h6h5**: King moves to h5. White can play g4+ (pawn to g4 check). If ...Kxg4, then h3 is coming, and Black's king is in a mating net.

**Best move:**

After careful analysis, **f7g6** is the best move. It removes the dangerous rook from g6, and after h2xg3, Black's king is still exposed, but at least the immediate mate threat is gone. The other moves either lose immediately or expose the king to a mating net.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
f7g6
```

2025-06-12 21:04:47,776 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.33s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on h6, pawns on a5, b7, e5, f6, g6, h7  
- White: King on e1, pawns on a2, f2, g2, h4

**Position:**  
- Black is up a pawn and has a more active king.
- White's king is far from the queenside and the action.
- Black's queenside pawns (a5, b7) are ready to advance.
- White's only hope is to create a passed pawn on the kingside, but Black's king is well-placed to stop this.
- Black's plan: Advance queenside pawns, create a passed pawn, and use the king to support promotion.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. **a5-a4**: Starts advancing the queenside majority. White cannot stop both pawns.
2. **b7-b5**: Also starts queenside play, but a4 is more forcing.
3. **h6-h5**: Prevents White from playing h5, but not urgent.
4. **g6-g5**: Fixes White's h4 pawn, but could create weaknesses.
5. **f6-f5**: Not urgent, could weaken the e5 pawn.
6. **e5-e4**: Gains space, but White's king can approach.

**Deeper Analysis:**
- After **a4**, White cannot stop the a-pawn without the king, but the king is far away.
- If White tries h5, Black can respond with g5, locking the kingside.
- If White tries to bring the king over, Black will have time to create a passed pawn.

**Best Move:**  
**a4** is the most direct and effective plan. It starts the queenside breakthrough, and White cannot stop the a-pawn without major concessions.

**Final move:**
```
a5a4
```

2025-06-12 21:07:45,165 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.70s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/4pppk/4p2P/p7/8/P4PP1/4K2R b K - 0 26

**Material count:**
- Black: King (h6), pawns (a4, b7, e5, f6, g6, h7)
- White: King (e1), pawns (a2, f2, g2, h5), rook (h1)

**Key points:**
- Black is up a pawn and has a passed a-pawn on a4.
- White's rook is on h1, with potential to become active.
- Black's king is on h6, potentially exposed, but White has no immediate threats.
- Black's g6 pawn is attacked by White's h5 pawn.
- Black's f6 pawn is also a potential target.
- White's king is far from the action.

**Legal moves:**
- h6g7 (King to g7)
- h6g5 (King to g5)
- g6h5 (Pawn takes h5)
- b7b6 (Pawn to b6)
- g6g5 (Pawn to g5)
- f6f5 (Pawn to f5)
- e5e4 (Pawn to e4)
- a4a3 (Pawn to a3)
- b7b5 (Pawn to b5)

**Candidate moves and analysis:**

1. **g6xh5** (Pawn takes h5)
   - This captures White's advanced pawn, removing a threat.
   - After g6xh5, White may play Ke2 or Rh3, but Black is up two pawns and can push the a-pawn.
   - White's rook is not yet active.
   - This seems safe and consolidates Black's advantage.

2. **a4a3**
   - Pushes the passed pawn, but White can play h6, and after g6xh5, White's rook can become active.
   - Not as urgent as capturing the h5 pawn.

3. **g6g5**
   - Defends the h5 pawn, but allows White to play g4, undermining Black's kingside.

4. **f6f5**
   - Opens the f-file, but White's rook is not yet active. However, this does not address the immediate threat on g6.

5. **h6g7 / h6g5**
   - King moves, but unnecessary as the king is not in danger.

6. **b7b6 / b7b5**
   - Not urgent, as the queenside is under control.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the h5 pawn with the g6 pawn, removing White's most advanced and dangerous pawn, consolidating Black's advantage, and preparing to push the a-pawn.

**Final move:**
```
g6h5
```

2025-06-12 21:10:54,382 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 11.00s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/4pp1k/4p2R/p7/8/P4PP1/4K3 b - - 0 27

**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Black: King (h6), pawns (a4, b7, e5, f6, h7)
- White: King (e1), rook (h5), pawns (a2, f2, g2, g3)

**Position analysis:**
- Black is up a pawn (5 vs 4).
- White's rook is active on h5, threatening to invade and pick up pawns.
- Black's king is on h6, somewhat exposed but not immediately in danger.
- Black's a4 pawn is advanced and could become a passed pawn.
- White's king is far from the action on e1.
- Black's f6 pawn is weak and could be targeted by White's rook.
- Black's h7 pawn is also weak.

**Legal moves:**
- h6g7
- h6g6
- h6h5

Let's consider each move:

---

### 1. h6g7

- King moves to g7.
- This move brings the king closer to the center and protects the f6 pawn.
- However, after h5h4, White can try to attack the kingside pawns.
- White's rook can swing to b5 or a5 to attack the b7 and a4 pawns.

### 2. h6g6

- King moves to g6.
- This keeps the king on the kingside, still defending f6.
- White can play h5h4, but Black can respond with h7h5, keeping the pawn structure intact.
- White's rook can try to invade via b5 or a5.

### 3. h6h5

- King moves to h5, capturing the rook.
- This is not legal, as there is no rook on h5 for Black to capture (the rook is White's).

So only h6g7 and h6g6 are legal.

---

## Candidate Move Analysis

### h6g6

- If 28. h5h4, then h7h5, keeping the pawn structure.
- White's rook can try to invade via b5 or a5, but Black's king is close enough to defend.
- Black can try to activate the king further and push the queenside pawns.

### h6g7

- If 28. h5h4, then h7h5, similar structure.
- White's rook can try to invade, but Black's king is a bit further from the queenside.

**Key point:** Black's king is needed on the queenside to support the a4 pawn and defend the b7 pawn. The king should not stray too far from the queenside.

**Is there any immediate threat from White?**
- White's rook is active, but cannot immediately invade.
- White's king is far away.

**Should Black push the h7 pawn?**
- Not yet, as it weakens the kingside.

**Should Black push the b-pawn?**
- Not yet, as it is defended.

**Best plan:** Centralize the king, defend the f6 pawn, and prepare to support the queenside pawns.

Between h6g7 and h6g6, **h6g6** is slightly better, as it keeps the king closer to the center and the queenside, and still defends the f6 pawn.

2025-06-12 21:15:17,852 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.06s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/4ppk1/4R3/p7/8/P4PP1/4K3 b - - 0 28  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on g6, pawns on a4, b7, e6, f6, h7
- White: King on e1, pawns on a2, f2, g2, e5, rook on e5

**White's threats:**
- White's rook is very active on e5, threatening to invade the 7th rank or attack pawns.
- White's king is far from the action but could become active in the endgame.
- White's pawn majority on the kingside could be dangerous if mobilized.

**Black's assets:**
- Passed a-pawn on a4, which could become dangerous if advanced.
- White's king is far from the queenside, so Black's queenside pawns could become a source of counterplay.
- Black's king is more active than White's.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a4-a3**: Advance the passed pawn. White can't stop it easily, but after Ra5, White can blockade.
2. **b7-b5**: Prepare to support the a-pawn, but White can play Rxb5.
3. **h7-h6**: Give the king luft, but not urgent.
4. **f6xe5**: Take the rook, but the rook is not en prise.
5. **g6-g7**: Retreat the king, but not necessary.
6. **g6-h6**: King to the edge, but not useful.
7. **f6-f5**: Advance the f-pawn, but White can play Rxe6+.
8. **h7-h5**: Not useful.

**Deep analysis:**

- **a3**: If 28...a3, White can play 29. Rxe6, Kf5 30. Rb6, but then a2 and the pawn is very close to queening. White's rook is active, but Black's pawn is very dangerous.
- **b5**: If 28...b5, White can play Rxb5, a3, Rb3, a2, and White can stop the pawn.
- **h6**: Not urgent.
- **g6-g7**: Passive.
- **f6-f5**: White can play Rxe6.

**Best move:**
Advancing the a-pawn is the most dangerous threat. White's rook is active, but Black's a-pawn is unstoppable unless White sacrifices the rook. Black's king is also well placed to support the queenside pawns if needed.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
a4a3
```

2025-06-12 21:18:15,169 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.95s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/4Rpk1/8/8/p7/P4PP1/4K3 b - - 0 29

**Material count:**
- Black: King (g6), pawns (a3, b7, h7)
- White: King (e1), rook (e6), pawns (a2, f2, g2, h2)

**White threats:**
- White's rook is very active on e6, and White's king is safe.
- White's next move could be Re7, attacking b7 and h7, or even Rb6, targeting b7.
- White's a2 pawn is blockaded by Black's a3 pawn, but White can try to win the a3 pawn with the king.

**Black's options:**
Legal moves: g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6h5, g6g5, g6f5, h7h6, b7b6, h7h5, b7b5

Let's consider each:

1. **g6g7**: King steps away from the center, not active.
2. **g6f7**: King centralizes, but White can play Rb6, attacking b7.
3. **g6h6**: King to the edge, not ideal.
4. **g6h5**: King to the edge, not ideal.
5. **g6g5**: King moves up, but White can play Re7, threatening b7.
6. **g6f5**: King centralizes, but White can play Re7.
7. **h7h6**: Pawn move, but White can play Rb6, attacking b7.
8. **b7b6**: Pawn move, but White can play Rxb6, a3 is weak.
9. **h7h5**: Pawn move, but White can play Re7.
10. **b7b5**: Pawn move, but White can play Rb6.

**Key strategic points:**
- Black's only hope is to push the a-pawn and try to promote.
- The king should support the a-pawn.
- The b7 pawn is weak and will fall if not defended.
- The king should move toward the queenside to support the a-pawn.

**Best move:**
- **g6f5** is the most active move, centralizing the king and heading toward the queenside to support the a-pawn. If White plays Re7, Black can try to defend b7 with b5 or move the king further toward the queenside.

**Final move:**
```
g6f5

2025-06-12 21:22:22,990 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.55s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/5R2/5k2/8/p7/P4PP1/4K3 b - - 0 30  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- White: King (e1), Rook (f6), pawns (a2, f2, g2, h2)
- Black: King (f5), pawn (a3, b7, h7)

**White threats:**
- White is up a rook for two pawns, but Black has a dangerous passed a-pawn on a3.
- White's rook is very active on f6, and the White king is far from the action but can approach.
- Black's king is centralized and can support pawn promotion.

**Legal moves:** f5f6, f5g5, f5e5, f5g4, f5e4

Let's analyze each:

---

### 1. **f5f6** (King to f6)
- This walks into a check: Rook f6 to f3+ or Rook f6 to f8+.
- White can check and then approach the a-pawn with the king.
- Not optimal.

### 2. **f5g5** (King to g5)
- This allows White to play Rook f6 to f7, cutting off the king from the queenside.
- White can then bring the king closer to the queenside to stop the a-pawn.
- Not optimal.

### 3. **f5e5** (King to e5)
- This allows White to check with Rook f6 to f7 or Rook f6 to h6.
- White's king is still far, but Black's king is moving away from the a-pawn, which is not ideal.

### 4. **f5g4** (King to g4)
- This allows White to check with Rook f6 to f7, and the king is far from the queenside.

### 5. **f5e4** (King to e4)
- This is the most aggressive move, centralizing the king and supporting the a-pawn's promotion.
- White's rook cannot check immediately.
- If White tries to bring the king closer (Ke2-d2-c2), Black can push the a-pawn.

---

## Deep Calculation

- After **f5e4**, White's best is probably to bring the king closer (Ke2-d2-c2).
- Black can push the a-pawn: a2.
- If White plays Rf6-f7, Black can play b5, supporting the a-pawn.
- White's king is still far, and Black's a-pawn is very close to queening.

**Key point:** Black's king on e4 is well-placed to support the a-pawn and can help shepherd it to promotion. White's king is too far to stop the pawn in time, and the rook alone cannot stop both the a- and b-pawns.

---

## Final Decision

**Best move:**  
```
f5e4

2025-06-12 21:26:14,912 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.90s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/4R3/8/4k3/p7/P4PP1/4K3 b - - 2 31

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on e4, pawn on b7, pawn on a3
- White: King on e1, rook on e6, pawns on a2, f2, g2, g3

**Immediate threats:**
- White's rook on e6 is very active and can check or attack pawns.
- Black's a3 pawn is two squares from queening, but White's rook can easily get behind it.
- Black's king is centralized but exposed.
- White's king is far away from the action.

**Legal moves:**
- e4f5
- e4d5
- e4f4
- e4d4
- e4d3

Let's analyze each:

---

### 1. **e4f5**
- King moves to f5.
- White can play Re7, attacking b7 and threatening to get behind the a-pawn.
- White's king is still far, but the rook is very active.
- Black's king is not helping the a-pawn advance.

### 2. **e4d5**
- King moves to d5.
- White can play Re7, again attacking b7.
- If b5, White can play Rxb7.
- The king is closer to the queenside, but White's rook is too active.

### 3. **e4f4**
- King moves to f4.
- White can play Re7, threatening b7.
- Black's king is moving away from the queenside, not ideal.

### 4. **e4d4**
- King moves to d4.
- White can play Re7, threatening b7.
- If b5, Rxb7.

### 5. **e4d3**
- King moves to d3.
- White can play Re7, threatening b7.
- If b5, Rxb7.

---

**Key point:** White's rook is going to attack b7 no matter what. Black's only hope is to push the a-pawn, but the White rook is too fast.

But let's look for any possible tricks.

#### What if Black tries to support the a-pawn with Kd3 and then b5?
- 31...Kd3 32.Re7 b5 33.Rxb7 Kc2 (attacking a2)
- 34.Rxb5 Kc1 (threatening Kb2 and queening)
- But White can play Ke2 and stop the pawn.

But let's see if Black can try to win the f2 or g2 pawns.

#### What if Black plays Kf5 and tries to attack f2/g2?
- 31...Kf5 32.Re7 b5 33.Rxb7 Ke4
- 34.Rxb5 Kd3 (threatening Kc2)
- 35.Rb3+ Kc2 36.Rxa3 Kb2 (but White's king is coming)

But in all lines, White's rook is too active and will pick up the pawns.

#### What about Kd5?
- 31...Kd5 32.Re7 b5 33.Rxb7 Kc4 34.Kd2 b4 35.Kc2 Kc5 36.Kb3 Kc6 37.Rxb4 Kd5 38.Kxa3

Again, White's rook is too active.

#### What about Kd3 and then try to win f2/g2?
- 31...Kd3 32.Re7 b5 33.Rxb7 Kc2 34.Rxb5 Kc1 35.Ke2 Kc2

But White's king is coming.

#### What about Kf4 and try to attack g3?
- 31...Kf4 32.Re7 b5 33.Rxb7 Kf3 34.Rxb5 Kxg2

But White's king is coming to help.

---

**Conclusion:** All moves seem to lead to a draw with best play, but the most challenging move for White is to centralize the king and try to support the a-pawn. The best move is to play **Kd3** to support the a-pawn and try to create counterplay.

**Final move:**

2025-06-12 21:29:28,018 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.49s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/8/8/8/p2kR3/P4PP1/4K3 b - - 4 32

**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Black: King (d3), pawn (a3), pawn (b7), pawn (h7)
- White: King (e1), rook (e3), pawn (a2), pawn (f2), pawn (g2), pawn (g3)

**Position:**
- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on a3, only one square from queening.
- White's rook is active on e3, and the king is on e1.
- Black's king is on d3, supporting the a3 pawn.

**Legal moves:**
- d3d4
- d3c4
- d3c2

**Candidate move analysis:**

1. **d3d4**: King moves forward, but doesn't threaten anything immediately. White could play Rxa3, but then bxa3 is not possible, so that's not a concern. However, White could try to bring the king closer or attack the pawns.

2. **d3c4**: King moves toward the queenside, possibly to support the a3 pawn. But after Kc4, White could play Rxa3, and the pawn is lost.

3. **d3c2**: King moves toward the queenside, possibly to support the a3 pawn, but again, Rxa3 is possible.

But let's check if Rxa3 is possible after any of these moves.

- After d3d4, White can play Rxa3, and the a3 pawn is lost.
- After d3c4, White can play Rxa3, and the a3 pawn is lost.
- After d3c2, White can play Rxa3, and the a3 pawn is lost.

But let's check if Black can queen the a-pawn before White can stop it.

Suppose Black plays d3d4, White plays Rxa3, Black plays b5, White plays Ra7, Black plays b4, White plays Kd2, Black plays b3, White plays Kc1, Black plays b2+, White plays Kb1, Black plays Kc3, but White can blockade the pawn.

Alternatively, let's check if Black can try to win the White pawns on the kingside.

But in all lines, if Black moves the king away from a3, White can capture the pawn.

**Is there a way to defend the a3 pawn?**

If Black plays Kc2, then after Rxa3, the king is too far to support the pawn.

**Is there a zugzwang or a trick?**

If Black plays d3d4, and White plays Rxa3, Black can try to push b5, but White's rook is active and can attack the pawns.

**Is there a way to create a passed pawn on the kingside?**

No, Black's pawns are too far.

**Is there a stalemate possibility?**

Not at the moment.

**Conclusion:**

All three moves lose the a3 pawn, but d3d4 keeps the king more centralized and may allow Black to try to create counterplay with the b-pawn. The other moves (Kc4, Kc2) don't offer any advantage.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
d3d4
```

2025-06-12 21:33:19,982 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 10.45s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/8/8/3kR3/p7/P4PP1/4K3 b - - 6 33

**Black to move.**

- Material: Black is up a pawn (a3 vs White's pawns on a2, f2, g2).
- White's king is on e1, rook on e4, pawns on a2, f2, g2.
- Black's king is on d4, pawn on a3, b7, h7.
- White's rook is active, but Black's king is very advanced and threatening.
- White's last move was Re4, so the rook is attacking the d4 king, but not directly threatening anything else.
- Black's a3 pawn is two steps from queening, but White's rook can swing over to stop it.
- Black's king is centralized and can support the a-pawn.

**Legal moves:**
- d4d5
- d4c5
- d4e4
- d4d3
- d4c3

Let's consider each:

### 1. d4d5
- King steps back, but loses centralization and support for the a-pawn.
- White can play Re7, attacking b7, or f2-f4, but Black's king is less active.

### 2. d4c5
- King steps to c5, supporting the a3 pawn, and threatening to push a2 next.
- White can play Re3, but after a2, White must play Rc3+ to stop promotion, but then Kb4 and the pawn is unstoppable.
- This looks very strong.

### 3. d4e4
- King captures the rook, but this is not legal since the rook is protected by the king.

### 4. d4d3
- King steps to d3, but this is passive and allows White to activate the rook.

### 5. d4c3
- King steps to c3, but this allows White to check with Re3+ and win the a3 pawn.

**Critical line for d4c5:**
- 1... Kc5 2. Re3 a2 3. Rc3+ Kb4 4. Rc1 Ka3 5. Kd2 Kb2 6. Rc2+ Kb1 7. Rc1+ Kb2 8. Rc2+ Kb3 9. Rc1 h5 (Black can push h5 and White is in zugzwang; Black will queen the a-pawn.)

**Conclusion:**
- The move **d4c5** (Kc5) is the best, supporting the a-pawn and threatening to queen. White cannot stop the pawn without losing material.

**Final move:**
```
d4c5
```

2025-06-12 21:35:05,680 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.83s):
Let's carefully analyze the position.

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/8/2k5/2R5/p7/P4PP1/4K3 b - - 8 34

**Material count:**
- Black: King (c5), pawns (a3, b7, h7)
- White: King (e1), rook (c4), pawns (a2, f2, g2, h2)

**Position:**
- Black is up a pawn (a3 is very advanced, b7 is a passed pawn).
- White's rook is active on c4, but Black's king is centralized and supports the a3 pawn.
- White's king is far from the action (e1).
- Black's plan: Push the a-pawn, support with king, and try to promote.
- White's plan: Use the rook to harass Black's pawns and king, try to win pawns or create counterplay.

**Legal moves:** c5d6, c5b6, c5d5, c5b5, c5c4

Let's evaluate each:

1. **c5d6**: King moves toward the center, but away from the a-pawn. Not ideal, as we want to support the a-pawn.
2. **c5b6**: King moves closer to the b7 pawn and can support pushing a2-a1. If White plays Rb4+, we can go Ka5 and support the pawn.
3. **c5d5**: King stays central, but doesn't help the a-pawn.
4. **c5b5**: King moves closer to the a-pawn, but White can play Rc3, attacking a3.
5. **c5c4**: King attacks the rook, but after Rxc4+, White wins the a3 pawn.

**Critical analysis:**
- **c5c4** is a blunder: White plays Rxc4+ and wins the a3 pawn.
- **c5d6** and **c5d5** don't help the a-pawn.
- **c5b5** and **c5b6** are best, as they support the a-pawn.

Let's look at **c5b6**:
- If White plays Rb4+, then Ka5, and the king is perfectly placed to shepherd the a-pawn.
- If White plays Rc3, then a2, and the pawn is ready to promote.

**c5b6** is the most precise move, keeping the king close to both pawns and supporting the promotion.

**Final move:**
```
c5b6

2025-06-12 21:37:24,233 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.41s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/1p5p/1kR5/8/8/p7/P4PP1/4K3 b - - 10 35

**Material:**
- Black: King on b6, pawn on a3, pawn on b7, pawn on h7
- White: King on e1, rook on c6, pawn on a2, pawn on f2, pawn on g2, pawn on h2

**Immediate threats:**
- White's rook is very active on c6, cutting off the Black king from the c-file and threatening to pick up pawns.
- Black's a3 pawn is two squares from queening, but White's rook can easily get behind it.
- Black's king is on b6, supporting the a3 pawn.
- White's king is far away on e1, but could start coming closer.
- Black's b7 pawn is weak and could be captured soon.

**Legal moves:**
- b6a7: King to a7
- b6c6: King captures rook (illegal, rook is protected by White king on e1)
- b6b5: King to b5
- b6a5: King to a5
- b7c6: Pawn captures rook

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b7xc6**: Pawn captures rook. This is the most forcing move. After b7xc6, White's king is far away, and Black has two connected passed pawns (a3 and c6). White has four pawns on the kingside, but Black's pawns are much more advanced. White's king is too far to stop the a-pawn, and White's rook is gone. This is a decisive material advantage for Black.

2. **Other king moves** (b6a7, b6b5, b6a5): These do not address the threat of the rook on c6, which can just capture the b7 pawn next move, and White will be up a rook.

**Calculation after b7xc6:**
- Black will have king on b6, pawns on a3 and c6.
- White will have king on e1, pawns on a2, f2, g2, h2.
- Black is up a rook and has two connected passed pawns, which should be a trivial win.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
b7c6
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/7p/1kp5/8/8/p7/P3KPP1/8 b - - 1 36

**Material:**
- Black: King on b6, pawn on a3, pawn on c6, pawn on h7
- White: King on e2, pawn on a2, pawn on f2, pawn on g2, pawn on g3

**Key factors:**
- Black is up a pawn (a3 vs a2), and has a passed pawn on a3, which is two squares from queening.
- White's king is far from the queenside and cannot stop the a-pawn in time.
- White's pawns on the kingside are not advanced and cannot create a passed pawn quickly.
- Black's king is ideally placed to support the a-pawn.
- Black's c6 pawn is also a potential asset.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **b6c7**: King moves closer to support the a-pawn and potentially to c8 to escort the pawn.
2. **b6b7**: King stays on the b-file, but doesn't help as much as c7.
3. **b6a7**: King moves to a7, but this blocks the a-pawn.
4. **b6a6**: King moves to a6, but doesn't help as much as c7.
5. **b6c5**: King moves away from the a-pawn, not ideal.
6. **b6b5**: King stays on the b-file, not optimal.
7. **b6a5**: King moves to a5, but doesn't help as much as c7.
8. **h7h6**: Pushes the h-pawn, but the kingside is not urgent.
9. **c6c5**: Pushes the c-pawn, but the a-pawn is closer to queening.
10. **h7h5**: Same as h6.

**Analysis:**
- The most direct plan is to promote the a-pawn. The White king is too far to stop it.
- The only way White can try to stop the pawn is to bring the king over, but it is too slow.
- By playing **b6c7**, Black prepares to play Kb7 and then a2-a1=Q, or even Kb6-a5-a4-a3-a2-a1=Q, depending on White's moves.
- After **b6c7**, if White plays Kd3, then a2, and White cannot stop the pawn.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play **b6c7**, bringing the king closer to support the a-pawn and ensure its promotion.

2025-06-12 21:41:45,085 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.64s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/2k4p/2p5/8/8/p4K2/P4PP1/8 b - - 3 37

**Material:**
- Black: King on f3, pawn on a3, c6, h7
- White: King on f3, pawns on a2, f2, g2, h2

**Black to move.**

**Candidate moves:**
1. c7d8 (King to d8)
2. c7c8 (King to c8)
3. c7b8 (King to b8)
4. c7d7 (King to d7)
5. c7b7 (King to b7)
6. c7d6 (King to d6)
7. c7b6 (King to b6)
8. h7h6 (pawn to h6)
9. c6c5 (pawn to c5)
10. h7h5 (pawn to h5)

**Position evaluation:**
- Black is up a pawn (a3 vs a2), and has a passed pawn on a3.
- White's king is centralized and can try to support the queenside.
- Black's king is on c7, can support the a-pawn, or move to the center.
- Black's c6 pawn can advance.
- Black's h7 pawn can advance, but White's kingside pawns are not threatening yet.

**Strategic goals:**
- Push the a-pawn to promote.
- Use the king to support the a-pawn.
- Avoid allowing White's king to blockade the a-pawn.
- Advance the c-pawn to support the a-pawn and restrict White's king.

**Move analysis:**

- **c6c5:** This is a strong move. It supports the a3 pawn, and if White plays Ke3, Black can play Kc6, and then a2, and the pawn is unstoppable. If White tries to bring the king to the queenside, Black's king can support the a-pawn.
- **h7h6 / h7h5:** These moves are slow and do not contribute to the main plan.
- **King moves:** Kd8, Kc8, Kb8, Kd7, Kb7, Kd6, Kb6. These are mostly passive and do not help the pawn advance.

**Calculation:**
- After c6c5, if White plays Ke3, then Kc6, and the king is supporting the pawns.
- If White plays g4, Black can ignore and push a2.
- If White tries to bring the king to the queenside, Black's king is already there.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the c-pawn to c5, supporting the a3 pawn and preparing to advance the a-pawn.

**Final move:**
```
c6c5
```

2025-06-12 21:46:52,774 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 13.08s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/2k4p/8/2p5/6P1/p4K2/P4P2/8 b - - 0 38  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on f3, pawn a3, pawn c5, pawn h7
- White: King f3, pawn a2, pawn f2, pawn g4

**Key points:**
- Black is up a pawn (a3 vs a2, c5 vs none, h7 vs f2/g4).
- White's king is centralized and active.
- Black's a3 pawn is very advanced and close to queening, but White's king is nearby.
- White's g4 pawn is advanced, but not immediately threatening.
- Black's king is on f3, White's on f3 (typo in FEN, but let's assume Black's king is on f3, White's on f3).

But from the FEN, Black's king is on f3, White's on f3. That can't be. Let's check the FEN:

8/2k4p/8/2p5/6P1/p4K2/P4P2/8 b - - 0 38

- Black king: f3
- White king: f3

But that's not possible. Let's check the FEN again:

8/2k4p/8/2p5/6P1/p4K2/P4P2/8 b - - 0 38

- 8: empty
- 2k4p: c7 (black king), h7 (black pawn)
- 8: empty
- 2p5: c5 (black pawn)
- 6P1: g4 (white pawn)
- a p4K2: a3 (black pawn), f3 (white king)
- P4P2: a2 (white pawn), f2 (white pawn)
- 8: empty

So, Black king is on c7, White king on f3.

**Black pawns:** a3, c5, h7  
**White pawns:** a2, f2, g4  
**Kings:** Black c7, White f3

**White to move next after Black's move.**

**Legal moves for Black:**
c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7d7, c7b7, c7d6, c7c6, c7b6, h7h6, c5c4, h7h5

**Analysis of candidate moves:**

1. **c5c4**  
   - Pushes the c-pawn, but White can play Ke3-d4 and try to stop the pawn.
   - White's king is far from the queenside, so c4 could be strong.

2. **a3a2**  
   - Not legal, as a3 is already on a3.

3. **h7h6 or h7h5**  
   - Not urgent, as kingside is locked.

4. **King moves**  
   - c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7d7, c7b7, c7d6, c7c6, c7b6
   - King can try to support the c-pawn or approach the a-pawn.

**Main plan:**  
- Black's a3 pawn is advanced, but White's king is close.
- Black's c5 pawn can be pushed to c4, making a passed pawn.
- Black's king can support the c-pawn or try to help the a-pawn.
- White's king is on f3, far from the queenside.

**Calculation:**

If 1...c5c4  
- 2. Ke3 (White king approaches)  
- 2...Kc6 (Black king approaches c5 pawn)  
- 3. Kd4 (White king approaches c4 pawn)  
- 3...Kb5 (Black king approaches a3 pawn)  
- 4. Kc3 (White king attacks a3)  
- 4...Ka4 (Black king supports a3)  

But White's king is too far to stop both pawns.

Alternatively, after 1...c5c4  
- 2. Ke3 Kc6  
- 3. Kd4 Kb5  
- 4. f4 (White tries to create counterplay)  
- 4...Kb4 (Black threatens a2)  
- 5. f5 c3

Black is winning.

**Other moves:**

- King moves don't seem to improve the situation.
- h7h6/h7h5 are slow.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to push the c-pawn and create a second passed pawn, which White's king cannot stop in time.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-12 21:49:51,341 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.29s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/2k4p/8/8/2p1K1P1/p7/P4P2/8 b - - 1 39

**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Black: King (c7), pawns (a3, c4, h7)
- White: King (e4), pawns (a2, f2, g4)

**Pawn structure and threats:**
- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on a3, two more on c4 and h7.
- White has pawns on a2, f2, g4. White's king is active, but Black's a-pawn is very close to queening.
- White's king is centralized and may try to attack Black's pawns or support his own.

**Candidate moves:**
1. **a2** (not legal, pawn is on a3)
2. **c4c3** (advance c-pawn, threatens to support a2-a1 queening)
3. **h7h6** (prepares h6-h5, but not urgent)
4. **c7d8** (king moves towards queenside, but not urgent)
5. **c7c8** (king to c8, not urgent)
6. **c7b8** (king to b8, not urgent)
7. **c7d7** (king to d7, not urgent)
8. **c7b7** (king to b7, not urgent)
9. **c7d6** (king to d6, not urgent)
10. **c7c6** (king to c6, not urgent)
11. **c7b6** (king to b6, not urgent)
12. **h7h5** (advance h-pawn, not urgent)

**Key tactical idea:** 
- The move **c4c3** is extremely strong. It threatens to play a2 next, and then a1=Q. White's king is too far to stop the a-pawn, and White's pawns are not dangerous enough to create counterplay. 

**Calculation:**
- 1... c4c3
- 2. Kd3 (trying to approach the pawns)
- 2... a2
- 3. Kc2 (only way to stop a1=Q)
- 3... Kb6 (or Kd4, but Kb6 supports a2)
- White cannot stop both c3 and a2. If White tries to take on c3, Black will queen the a-pawn.

**Conclusion:** 
The move **c4c3** is the most direct and decisive. It forces White to deal with two connected passed pawns, and White's king is too far to stop both.

**Final move:**
```
c4c3
```

2025-06-12 21:52:04,007 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.26s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/2k4p/8/8/6P1/p1pK4/P4P2/8 b - - 1 40  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (c7), pawns a3, c3, h7
- White: King (d3), pawns a2, f2, g4

**Assessment:**
- Black is up two connected passed pawns (a3, c3) vs White's a2 pawn.
- White's king is closer to the queenside, but Black's c3 pawn is only two squares from promotion.
- Black's king is on c7, supporting the c3 pawn.
- White's king is on d3, also eyeing the c3 pawn.
- White's g4 pawn is advanced, but Black has a pawn on h7.

**Legal moves:**
c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7d7, c7b7, c7d6, c7c6, c7b6, h7h6, c3c2, h7h5

**Candidate moves:**
- c3c2: Push the c-pawn, threatening to promote next move. White can play Kxc2, but then a2 is hanging.
- h7h6 or h7h5: Not urgent, doesn't affect the queenside race.
- King moves: c7d8, c7c8, etc. Not as forcing as pawn push.

**Critical calculation:**
If 1...c3c2:
- 2. Kxc2 a2
- 3. Kb2 (only move to stop a1=Q) Kd6 (or Kd7)
- Black can try to bring the king to support the a-pawn, but White can blockade.

Alternatively, after 1...c3c2, if White ignores and pushes g4-g5:
- 2. g5 c1=Q
- 3. g6 hxg6
- Black is up a queen.

But let's check if White can stop both pawns:
- 1...c3c2 2. Kxc2 a2 3. Kb2 Kd6 4. f4 Kd5 5. f5 Ke5 6. Ka1 Kf6 7. Kb2 Kg5
- Black's king can help push the h-pawn.

Alternatively, if White doesn't take c2:
- 1...c3c2 2. Kd2 (waiting) c1=Q 3. Kxc1 Kd6
- Black is up a queen.

**Is there any way for White to draw after 1...c3c2?**
- No, Black's pawns are too fast.

**Other moves:**
- King moves don't threaten immediate promotion.
- h7h6/h7h5 are too slow.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the c-pawn:

```
c3c2

2025-06-12 21:53:46,750 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-12 21:53:57,752 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 11.00s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/2k4p/8/8/6P1/p7/P1K2P2/8 b - - 0 41  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on c7, pawn on a3, pawn on h7
- White: King on c2, pawn on a2, pawn on f2, pawn on g4

**Pawn structure:**
- Black has a dangerous a3 passed pawn, two pawns vs three for White.
- White's king is close to the queenside, but Black's a3 pawn is one step from queening.
- White's g4 pawn is advanced, but Black's king is far from it.

**Legal moves:**
c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7d7, c7b7, c7d6, c7c6, c7b6, h7h6, h7h5

**Candidate moves:**
- The most critical idea is to push the a-pawn to a2, but it's already on a3.
- White's king is on c2, so if Black plays a2, White can play Kb2 and block.
- If Black's king moves away from c7, White's king can approach the a-pawn.
- If Black plays h7-h6 or h7-h5, it doesn't help the a-pawn's promotion.

**Calculation:**
- If Black plays c7d6, White can play Kb3, attacking the a3 pawn.
- If Black plays c7b6, White can play Kb3, again attacking the a3 pawn.
- If Black plays c7d8, White can play Kb3.
- If Black plays c7b8, White can play Kb3.
- If Black plays h7h6, White can play Kb3.

But let's check if Black can try to support the a-pawn with the king.

**Line 1: c7d6**
- 1... Kd6 2. Kb3 Kc5 3. Kxa3 Kd4
- But after 4. Kb4, White can hold.

**Line 2: h7h6**
- 1... h6 2. Kb3 Kd6 3. Kxa3 Ke5
- White is up a pawn and can try to push on the kingside.

**Line 3: c7b6**
- 1... Kb6 2. Kb3 Kb5 3. Kxa3 Kc4
- White's king is closer to the kingside pawns.

**Line 4: c7d8**
- 1... Kd8 2. Kb3 Kd7 3. Kxa3 Ke6
- White is up a pawn.

**Line 5: c7b8**
- 1... Kb8 2. Kb3 Kb7 3. Kxa3 Kc6

**Line 6: c7c8**
- 1... Kc8 2. Kb3 Kd7 3. Kxa3 Ke6

**Line 7: c7d7**
- 1... Kd7 2. Kb3 Kd6 3. Kxa3 Ke5

**Line 8: c7b7**
- 1... Kb7 2. Kb3 Kb6 3. Kxa3 Kc5

**Line 9: c7d6**
- Already considered.

**Line 10: c7c6**
- 1... Kc6 2. Kb3 Kd5 3. Kxa3 Ke4

**Line 11: c7b6**
- Already considered.

**Is there any way to save the a-pawn?**
If Black plays c7b6 and White plays Kb3, then Kb5, Kxa3, Kc4, but White's king is closer to the kingside pawns.

**What about pushing the h-pawn?**
If Black plays h7h5, White can ignore and play Kb3.

**Is there any zugzwang?**
If Black plays h7h5, White plays Kb3, and Black is forced to move the king.

**Best try:**
The only way to try to win is to keep the king close to the a-pawn and try to win the kingside pawns. If Black plays Kb6, and White plays Kb3, then Kb5, Kxa3, Kc4, but White's king is closer to the kingside pawns.

**Conclusion:**
All moves seem to lead to a draw with best play, but the most testing move is to keep the king close to the a-pawn and try to outflank White's king. The move 41...Kb6 keeps the king close and gives Black the best chance to try to outmaneuver White.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-12 21:56:19,157 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.49s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/7p/1k6/6P1/8/p7/P1K2P2/8 b - - 0 42  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on b6, pawn on a3, pawn on h7
- White: King on c2, pawn on a2, pawn on f2, pawn on g5

**Immediate threats:**
- White's g-pawn is advanced and could become dangerous if supported.
- Black's a3 pawn is two squares from promotion, but White's king is nearby.
- Black's king is closer to the queenside pawns.
- Black has an extra pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. b6c7: King moves toward the a2 pawn, supporting a3-a2.
2. b6b7: King stays on b7, not progressing.
3. b6a7: King moves away from the action.
4. b6c6: King centralizes, but c7 is more direct.
5. b6a6: King moves away.
6. b6c5: King moves toward White's kingside pawns, but a3 is more urgent.
7. b6b5: King stays on b5.
8. b6a5: King moves away.
9. h7h6: Pushes the h-pawn, but not urgent.
10. h7h5: Pushes the h-pawn, but not urgent.

**Key lines:**
- If 1. ... Kc7, then 2. Kb3 (attacking a3), 2. ... a2 3. Kxa2 Kd6 (heading to g5 pawn), but White can try to push g5-g6.
- If 1. ... a2, White can play Kb2 and capture the pawn.
- If 1. ... Kc7, White can't stop a2 without giving up the g-pawn.

**Calculation:**
1. ... Kc7  
2. Kb3 a2  
3. Kxa2 Kd6  
Now Black can head toward the kingside to stop the g-pawn. White's king is far from the kingside, so Black can win the h-pawn and then the g-pawn.

**Alternative:**
If Black tries to push the h-pawn, White's king will take the a3 pawn and then support the g-pawn.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to play **Kc7**, supporting the a3 pawn and preparing to push a2. This forces White's king to the queenside, after which Black's king can head to the kingside and win the remaining pawns.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-12 21:57:43,912 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.80s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/2k4p/6P1/8/8/p7/P1K2P2/8 b - - 0 43

**Material:**
- Black: King on c7, pawn on a3, pawn on h7
- White: King on c2, pawn on a2, pawn on f2, pawn on g6

**Immediate threats:**
- White's g6 pawn is two squares from queening, but Black's king is far away.
- Black's a3 pawn is one square from queening, but White's king is nearby.
- White's king is on c2, close to the a3 pawn.
- Black's king is on c7, can support the a3 pawn or move toward the kingside.

**Legal moves:**
c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7d7, c7b7, c7d6, c7c6, c7b6, h7g6, h7h6, h7h5

**Candidate moves:**
1. **c7d8**: King moves toward the a3 pawn, but White's king is already on c2.
2. **c7c8**: King stays on the same file, not useful.
3. **c7b8**: King moves away from the action.
4. **c7d7**: King moves toward the center, but not helpful.
5. **c7b7**: King moves away.
6. **c7d6**: King moves toward the center.
7. **c7c6**: King moves toward the center.
8. **c7b6**: King moves toward the a3 pawn, but White's king is closer.
9. **h7g6**: Pawn captures g6 pawn. This is a critical move.

**Key tactical point:**
- If Black plays h7xg6, White cannot stop the a3 pawn from queening, because the White king is too far away after the exchange.
- If Black does not capture on g6, White will play g7 and g8=Q, which is dangerous.

**Calculation:**
- h7xg6
  - If White plays fxg6, Black plays a2 and queens.
  - If White plays Kb3, Black plays a2, and White cannot stop a1=Q.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to capture the g6 pawn, eliminating White's passed pawn and securing Black's own passed a-pawn.

**Final move:**
```
h7g6
```

2025-06-12 22:01:24,564 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.83s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/2k5/6p1/8/5P2/p7/P1K5/8 b - - 0 44  
**Black to move.**

**Material count:**
- Black: King (c7), pawn (g6), pawn (a3)
- White: King (c2), pawn (f4), pawn (a2)

**Pawn structure:**
- Black has a dangerous passed a-pawn on a3, two squares from promotion.
- White has a passed f-pawn, but it's further from queening and the Black king is closer to the action.
- Black's king is more centralized and can support the a-pawn.

**Candidate moves:**
1. c7d8: King moves toward the a-pawn, but not necessary yet.
2. c7c8: King stays on the c-file.
3. c7b8: King moves toward the a-pawn, but a3 is not under threat.
4. c7d7: King moves toward the center.
5. c7b7: King moves toward the a-pawn.
6. c7d6: King moves toward the center.
7. c7c6: King stays on the c-file.
8. c7b6: King moves toward the a-pawn.
9. g6g5: Pushes the g-pawn, but White's king is far from the kingside.

**Critical analysis:**
- The a-pawn is two squares from promotion. White's king is on c2, so if White tries to approach the a-pawn, Black can support it with the king.
- White's only hope is to push the f-pawn and try to create counterplay.
- If Black pushes g5, White can play f5, and the kingside pawns may become dangerous.
- If Black plays a2, White can play Kb2, and after a1=Q, Kxa1, Black loses the pawn.
- The Black king should stay close enough to support the a-pawn's promotion.

**Best move:**
- The move c7d6 brings the king closer to the center and supports the a-pawn's advance if needed.
- However, c7b6 or c7b7 are also good, as they keep the king close to the a-pawn.

But let's calculate the direct plan:
- If Black plays c7b6, White plays Kb3, then a2, Kxa2, and the pawn is lost.
- If Black plays c7d6, White plays Kb3, and again, the a-pawn is lost if pushed.

But what if Black plays g6g5?
- White plays f5, then Black plays Kd6, and the kingside pawns are not dangerous.

But let's check if Black can win by pushing the g-pawn:
- 1... g5 2. f5 g4 3. f6 Kd7 (or Kd6) and Black's king can support the a-pawn.

But if Black plays g5, White can try to create a passed pawn on the kingside.

Alternatively, Black can play Kd6 to centralize and then support the a-pawn.

**Conclusion:**
- The best move is to centralize the king with **c7d6**, keeping options open to support the a-pawn or stop White's kingside pawns.

**Final move:**
```
c7d6
```

2025-06-12 22:03:38,797 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.57s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/3k2p1/5P2/8/p7/P1K5/8 b - - 0 45  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King (d6), pawn (a3), pawn (g6)
- White: King (c2), pawn (a2), pawn (f5)

**Position:**
- Black's a3 pawn is two squares from queening, but White's king is close.
- Black's g6 pawn is blockaded by White's f5 pawn, but can be supported by the king.
- White's f5 pawn is advanced, but Black's king is well-placed to stop it.
- White's a2 pawn is blockaded by Black's a3 pawn.

**Legal moves:** d6e7, d6d7, d6c7, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5, g6f5, g6g5

**Candidate moves:**
1. **g6xf5**: Captures White's advanced pawn, removing White's only hope for counterplay. After this, Black has two connected passed pawns (a3 and f5) and a king close to the action. White's king is too far to stop both pawns.
2. **King moves (d6e7, d6d7, etc.)**: These don't address the immediate threat of White's f5 pawn.
3. **g6g5**: Advances the pawn, but doesn't address the f5 pawn.

**Analysis:**
- If Black plays **g6xf5**, White cannot stop both the a-pawn and the f-pawn from queening. For example:
    - 1... g6xf5 2. Kb3 (trying to get to a3) a2 3. Kxa2 Kc4 and Black's king supports the f-pawn.
    - If White tries to stop the f-pawn, Black's a-pawn will queen.

- If Black does not take on f5, White may play fxg6 and try to create a passed pawn.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to capture the f5 pawn, eliminating White's counterplay and securing a winning king and pawn endgame.

**Final move:**
```
g6f5
```

2025-06-12 22:06:43,695 - INFO - Attempt 1/5...
2025-06-12 22:06:51,473 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.78s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/8/3k4/5p2/8/p2K4/P7/8 b - - 1 46

**Material count:**
- Black: King (d6), pawn (a3), pawn (f5)
- White: King (d3), pawn (a2)

**Key features:**
- Black has an advanced passed a-pawn (a3).
- White's king is closer to the queenside, but Black's king is more centralized.
- Black's f5 pawn is a potential asset, but also could be a target.
- White's only pawn is on a2, which is blockaded by Black's a3 pawn.

**Legal moves:**
d6e7, d6d7, d6c7, d6e6, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5, f5f4

**Candidate moves:**
- d6e7, d6d7, d6c7, d6e6, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5, d6c5: King moves
- f5f4: Pawn push

**Analysis:**

1. **f5f4:** This move pushes the pawn, but White can respond with Ke2 or Ke4, and Black's king is not supporting the pawn. Also, White can blockade or attack the pawn, and the king is close enough to stop the a-pawn if Black's king leaves.

2. **King moves:** The king should ideally support the a-pawn's promotion or help advance the f-pawn. Let's see if we can escort the a-pawn.

- If d6c5, White plays Kc3, attacking the a3 pawn.
- If d6c7, White plays Kc4, again attacking the a3 pawn.
- If d6e6, White plays Kc3, and again threatens the a3 pawn.
- If d6e5, White plays Kc3, and again threatens the a3 pawn.

But if we play **d6e7**, we keep the king closer to the a-pawn and also keep the option to support f5-f4.

Let's check the line:

**46... d6e7**
- 47. Kc3 (attacking a3)
- 47... f4 (now the king is close enough to support both pawns)
- 48. Kb3 (attacking a3)
- 48... f3 (threatening f2 and promotion)
- 49. Kxa3 f2
- 50. Kb4 f1=Q

But after 47. Kc3, if Black plays f4, White can play Kb3, and after f3, Kxa3, f2, Kb4, f1=Q, White's king is too far to stop the f-pawn.

Alternatively, if White tries to stop the f-pawn with Ke3 after d6e7, Black can play f4, and the king is close enough to support.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to centralize the king and prepare to push the f-pawn, while keeping the king close enough to support the a-pawn if needed.

Therefore, the best move is:

```
d6e7
```

2025-06-12 22:11:20,781 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.05s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/5p2/2K5/p7/P7/8 b - - 3 47

**Material:**
- Black: King on e7, pawn on a3, pawn on f5
- White: King on c4, pawn on a2

**Key features:**
- Black is up a pawn (a3 vs a2, f5 vs nothing).
- Black's a3 pawn is two squares from queening, but White's king is close.
- White's king is on c4, very close to the a3 pawn.
- Black's king is on e7, far from the queenside.
- White's a2 pawn is blockaded by Black's a3 pawn.
- Black's f5 pawn is passed and could become dangerous if the king supports it.

**Legal moves:**
e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6, f5f4

Let's consider candidate moves:

1. **f5-f4**: This pushes the passed pawn, but White's king is too far to stop it immediately. However, White can take the a3 pawn and then try to stop the f-pawn.
2. **King moves (e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6)**: All king moves are slow and do not immediately change the situation. The king is far from the queenside, so it cannot help the a3 pawn.
3. **e7e6**: This brings the king closer to the queenside, but White will play Kb3 and capture the a3 pawn anyway.

**Critical line after f5-f4:**
- 47... f4
- 48. Kb3 f3
- 49. a2a3 (White can't play this, as a2 is blocked)
- 49. Kxa3 f2
- 50. Kb4 f1=Q

But after 48. Kb3, if Black plays f3, White plays Kxa3, and then f2, but White's king is on a3 and can get to f2 in time.

Let's check:
47... f4
48. Kb3 f3
49. Kxa3 f2
50. Kb4 f1=Q
51. a2

But White's pawn is still on a2, so Black can try to win.

Alternatively, if Black does nothing, White will just take the a3 pawn and then try to win with the king.

**Is there a way for White to draw after f5-f4?**

Let's check the main line:
47... f4
48. Kb3 f3
49. Kxa3 f2
50. Kb4 f1=Q

Now, White's king is on b4, Black has a queen, White has a pawn on a2.

Black should be winning.

**Alternative:**
If Black plays a waiting king move, White will play Kb3 and Kxa3, and then Black's f-pawn is not fast enough.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the f-pawn immediately.

**Final move:**
```
f5f4
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/5p2/pK6/P7/8 b - - 1 48

**Material:**
- Black: King (e7), pawn (f4), pawn (a3)
- White: King (b3), pawn (a2)

**Key points:**
- Black is up a pawn (f4 vs nothing on kingside).
- Black's a3 pawn is one square from queening, but White's king is close.
- White's king is on b3, blocking the a-pawn.
- Black's king is on e7, far from the queenside, but close to supporting the f-pawn.
- White's only pawn is a2, blocked by Black's a3 pawn.

**Legal moves:**
e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6, f4f3

**Candidate moves:**
- f4f3: Push the f-pawn, but White's king is too far to stop it. However, White can play Kxa3, and then Black can try to queen the f-pawn.
- King moves: e7-f8, e7-e8, etc. But the king is far from the queenside, so pushing the f-pawn is more urgent.

**Calculation:**
1. f4f3
   - White plays Kxa3
   - Black plays f2
   - White plays Kb2
   - Black plays f1=Q
   - White plays Kc2
   - Black has a queen and a pawn vs king.

Alternatively, if Black tries to move the king, White will just take the a3 pawn and then try to stop the f-pawn.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to push the f-pawn immediately.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/8/K4p2/P7/8 b - - 0 49  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on e7, pawn on f3
- White: King on a3, pawn on a2

**White's king is far from the action, Black's pawn is on f3, ready to advance. White's only hope is to try to bring the king over or push the a-pawn, but Black is much faster.**

**Legal moves:**
e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6, f3f2

**Candidate moves:**
- f3f2: Push the pawn, threatening to queen next move.
- King moves: Not urgent, as the pawn is ready to promote.

**Analysis:**
- f3f2 is the most direct and decisive. After f3f2, White cannot stop f1=Q. White's king is too far to help, and the a-pawn is not fast enough.
- Any king move is slower and gives White time to push a4-a5-a6, but Black will queen first regardless.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to push the pawn:

```
f3f2

2025-06-12 22:22:02,943 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 3.94s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/8/8/PK3p2/8 b - - 1 50  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on e7, pawn on f2
- White: King on b2

**Legal moves:**
- e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6
- f2f1q, f2f1r, f2f1b, f2f1n

**Position:**
- Black has a pawn on f2, ready to promote.
- White's king is on b2, far from the action.
- Black's king is on e7, central and close to the promotion square.

**Analysis:**

The most critical move is to promote the pawn. Let's check if there is any danger in promoting to a queen (f2f1q):

- After f2f1=Q, White's king is on b2 and cannot immediately threaten the new queen.
- There are no White pawns or pieces to threaten Black.
- Black will have a queen and king vs. king, a trivial win.

Promoting to a queen is the fastest way to victory. There is no stalemate, no perpetual, and no counterplay for White.

**Other promotions (rook, bishop, knight) are unnecessary and only risk prolonging the game.**

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.

2025-06-12 22:28:15,845 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.78s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/8/8/P1K5/5q2 b - - 1 51  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**  
- Black: King on e7, Queen on f1  
- White: King on c2, Pawn on a2

**White's king is on c2, pawn on a2. Black's king is on e7, queen on f1.**

**Black is completely winning.**  
- White has no threats.  
- The only hope for White is to try to promote the a-pawn, but Black's queen can easily stop it.  
- Black should look for a forced mate or a way to win the pawn and deliver mate.

**Candidate moves:**
- All queen moves: f1f2, f1f3, f1f4, f1f5, f1f6, f1f7, f1f8, f1e2, f1d3, f1c4, f1b5, f1a6, f1b1, f1c1, f1d1, f1e1, f1g1, f1h1, f1g2, f1h3, f1a1
- King moves: e7e8, e7d8, e7f8, e7f7, e7d7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6

But the queen can check the king and force mate.

**Check for forced mate:**
- Qf2+ forces the king to b1 or c1 (if Kd1, Qd2#)
- Qf5+ forces the king to b3 or c3
- Qc4+ forces the king to b2 or b1

But let's look for the fastest mate.

**1. ... Qc4+**
- If Kb2, Qb4+ and then Qb2#
- If Kd2, Qd4+ and then Qd1#

But after 1...Qc4+, White can only play Kb2 or Kd2.

- 1... Qc4+ 2. Kb2 Qb4+ 3. Ka1 Qb2# (mate)
- 1... Qc4+ 2. Kd2 Qd4+ 3. Ke2 Qd1# (mate)

But after 1...Qc4+, Kb2 is forced (as Kd2 is not possible, king is on c2).

So let's check:

1... Qc4+  
2. Kb2 Qb4+  
3. Ka1 Qb2#

**This is forced mate in 3.**

Therefore, the best move is:
```
qc4
```

2025-06-12 22:30:07,030 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.37s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on e7, Queen on c4  
- White: King on b2, Pawn on a2

**Black to move.**

**Immediate threats:**  
- White has only a king and a pawn. The pawn is not advanced and cannot be promoted soon.
- Black has a queen and king, so this is a textbook queen vs king and pawn endgame. Black should win with correct play.
- The only way for White to draw is by stalemate or perpetual check, but with only a pawn and king, that's not possible unless Black blunders.

**Candidate moves:**  
- The queen is already cutting off the White king from the c-file and the 4th rank.
- The White king is on b2, pawn on a2. Black's king is on e7.
- The best plan is to restrict the White king, prevent the pawn from advancing, and bring the king closer.

**Move options:**
- c4b4: Queen to b4, directly attacks the pawn on a2. If White plays a2a3, then Qb4a4 wins the pawn.
- c4d4: Queen to d4, keeps the king cut off, but doesn't attack the pawn directly.
- c4a4: Queen to a4, attacks the pawn directly.
- c4c3+: Queen to c3 check, but White king can go to b1 or b1, not very effective.
- c4e2: Queen to e2, but doesn't do much.

**Best move:**
- **Qb4** (c4b4) attacks the pawn directly and restricts the White king. If White tries to defend with Kc2, then Qb4a4 wins the pawn. If White pushes a3, then Qb4a4 wins the pawn. After the pawn is gone, Black can easily force mate.

**Double-check for stalemate:**
- After Qb4, White still has moves (a3, Kc2, Ka1), so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
c4b4
```

2025-06-12 22:33:19,496 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.58s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/1q6/8/P1K5/8 b - - 5 53

- Black: King on e7, Queen on b4
- White: King on c2, Pawn on a2

**Material:** Black is up a queen vs a pawn. White has only a king and a pawn.

**Threats and goals:**
- Black's main goal: Checkmate the White king or win the pawn and promote.
- White's only hope: Try to draw by stalemate or perpetual check (not possible here), or hope for a blunder.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- The White king is on c2, pawn on a2.
- Black's queen is very active on b4, and the king is safe on e7.
- There are no immediate stalemate tricks for White.

**Candidate moves:**
- b4a4: Queen cuts off the king, but not forcing.
- b4c4+: Check, king can go to b3 or d2.
- b4e4+: Check, king can go to b3 or d2.
- b4b6: Queen stays on the b-file, controls promotion square.
- b4a3: Attacks pawn directly.

**Best plan:** 
- Win the a2 pawn, then checkmate with queen and king.
- Avoid stalemate tricks.

**Check moves:**
- b4c4+ and b4e4+ are checks.

Let's calculate b4c4+:
- 1... Qc4+ 2. Kb2 (if Kd2, then Qxa2+ wins pawn)
- 2... Qb4+ 3. Kc2 (if Ka1, Qc3# is mate)
- 3... Qxa2+ 4. Kc1 (forced)
- 4... Kd6 (bring king closer, but let's see if there's a mate)
- Alternatively, after Qxa2, Black can bring the king in and checkmate.

But let's check for immediate mate:
- b4c4+ Kb2 Qc3+ Kb1 Qb2#

So, let's check:
1... Qc4+ 2. Kb2 Qc3+ 3. Kb1 Qb2#

This is mate in 3.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
b4c4
```

2025-06-12 22:36:06,245 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 7.43s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Material:**  
- Black: King on e7, Queen on c4  
- White: King on b2, Pawn on a2  

**Black to move.**

**Immediate tactical considerations:**  
- White has only a king and a pawn. Black has a queen and king.  
- White's king is on b2, pawn on a2.  
- Black's queen is on c4, king on e7.  
- The pawn is not dangerous yet, but Black must avoid stalemates and accidental perpetuals.

**Goal:**  
- Convert the material advantage to a win.  
- Avoid stalemate (especially with the White king on the edge and only one pawn left).

**Candidate moves:**  
- Queen moves: c4-c3+, c4-b4+, c4-d4, c4-d3, c4-e2, c4-c2, c4-c1, etc.
- King moves: e7-f8, e7-e8, e7-d8, e7-f7, e7-d7, e7-f6, e7-e6, e7-d6

**Key points:**  
- The White king is on b2, so queen checks along the b-file or c3+ are possible.
- Avoiding stalemate: If the queen covers all escape squares and the pawn can't move, it's stalemate.
- The Black king is far from the White king, but can approach.

**Best plan:**  
- Use the queen to cut off the White king and bring the Black king closer.
- Avoid checks that force the White king to a1, as that can lead to stalemate if not careful.
- Don't take the pawn unless it is safe to do so.

**Move analysis:**

1. **c4-b4+**:  
   - White must play Ka1 or Ka3.  
   - If Ka1, then the king is in the corner, which can be dangerous for stalemate.  
   - If Ka3, then the king is on the edge, but not stalemated.

2. **c4-c3+**:  
   - White must play Kb1 or Kb1 (only move), then Black can continue checking or bring the king closer.

3. **c4-d4**:  
   - No check, just centralizing the queen, but not pressing.

4. **c4-d3**:  
   - Attacks the pawn, but not a check.

5. **King moves:**  
   - e7-f6: Brings the king closer, but gives White a tempo to play a3.

**Is there a forced mate or a way to win the pawn?**  
- Not immediately, but the best way is to keep checking and pushing the king to the edge, then bring the king closer.

**Best move:**  
- **c4-b4+** is the most forcing move, as it checks the king and keeps the initiative. If White plays Ka1, be careful of stalemate. If Ka3, then Black can continue with Qc3+ or Qb5, etc.

**Final decision:**  
```
c4b4+

2025-06-12 22:40:15,153 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.68s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/1q6/8/P1K5/8 b - - 9 55

- Black: King on e7, Queen on b4
- White: King on c2, Pawn on a2

**Material:** Black is up a queen vs a pawn.

**Threats:** 
- White has no immediate threats. The only pawn is on a2, and the king is on c2.
- Black's queen is very active, and the white king is cut off from the a-pawn.

**Goal:** Checkmate or win the pawn and queen vs king endgame.

**Candidate moves:**
- b4a4: Cuts off the king from the a-file, attacks the pawn.
- b4a3: Attacks the pawn directly.
- b4c5: Checks the king.
- b4b2: Attacks the pawn and restricts the king.
- e7d6: Centralizes the king.
- e7f6: Centralizes the king.

**Analysis:**
- The fastest way to win is to take the a2 pawn, then use queen and king to checkmate.
- White's king is on c2, so a direct capture with b4xa2 is not possible yet.
- If we play b4a4, the king cannot go to b3 or b1, and if Kb2, then Qxa2+ wins the pawn.
- If we play b4a3, White can play Kb1, and then Qxa2 is possible.
- If we play b4b2, White is forced to move the king, and then we can take the pawn.

**Checking for stalemate traps:**
- After b4a4, if White plays Kb1, then Qxa2 is possible.
- After b4a3, if White plays Kb1, then Qxa2 is possible.
- After b4b2, if White plays Kc1, then Qxa2 is possible.

**Best move:**
- b4a4 is the most precise, as it cuts off the king and prepares to win the pawn with no counterplay.

**Final move:**
```
b4a4
```

2025-06-12 22:42:59,064 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.28s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/q7/2K5/P7/8 b - - 11 56

**Black to move.**

**Material:**
- Black: King on e7, Queen on a4
- White: King on c3, Pawn on a2

**Position:**
- Black is up a queen vs a pawn. White's king is far from the pawn, and the pawn is not dangerous.
- Black's queen is very active on a4, cutting off the White king.
- White's king is on c3, not threatening anything.
- Black's king is on e7, safe.

**Objective:** 
- Convert the material advantage to a win.
- Avoid stalemate tricks.
- Avoid perpetual check (not possible here).
- Press for a swift checkmate.

**Candidate moves:**
- With the queen on a4, we can cut off the White king and push it to the edge.
- The Black king can approach to help deliver mate.
- Moves like Qxa2 win the pawn, but let's check for stalemate: If Qxa2, White has Kb4, Kd3, Kd2, Kb2, so not stalemate.
- Qxa2 is safe and removes the last White pawn, making the win trivial.

**Other candidate moves:**
- Qa3+ checks, but White can escape to d2 or c4.
- Qc6+ checks, but White can go to d2 or b4.
- Qxa2 is the cleanest.

**Check for stalemate after Qxa2:**
- White's king on c3, Black queen on a2, Black king on e7.
- White can move to b4, d3, d2, b2, so not stalemate.

**Conclusion:** 
- The best move is to capture the pawn and remove any hope for White.

**Final move:**
```
a4a2

2025-06-12 22:47:06,150 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.59s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/3K4/8/q7/8 b - - 1 57  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**  
- Black: King on e7, Queen on a2  
- White: King on d4

**Immediate tactical and strategic considerations:**
- Black is up a queen versus a lone king. This is a trivially won position for Black with correct technique.
- The only way Black can fail to win is by stalemating White or allowing a perpetual check (which is impossible here).
- The goal is to restrict the White king and force it to the edge, then deliver mate.

**Candidate moves:**
- All queen moves are possible, but the best are those that restrict the White king's mobility and avoid stalemate.
- King moves are possible, but the king is already well placed to help in the mate net.

**Key points:**
- The White king is on d4, so we want to keep it from escaping to the center.
- The queen should cut off files/ranks and drive the king to the edge.
- Avoid stalemating the White king.

**Move analysis:**

1. **a2a4**: Queen to a4 checks the White king. After Kd4-c5, Qa4-a5+ forces the king further to the edge. This is a standard queen and king checkmating technique.
2. **a2a3**: Queen to a3 restricts the White king's movement, but does not check. The White king can move to c4 or e4.
3. **a2d2**: Queen to d2 checks the White king. After Kd4-c5, Qd2-d6+ is possible.
4. **a2a1**: Queen to a1 does not check or restrict the king much.
5. **a2c4**: Queen to c4 checks the White king. After Kd4-e5, Qc4-e6+ is possible.

**Best move:**

- **a2a4** is a check and forces the king to c5 or e3, both of which are steps toward the edge.
- **a2d2** is also a check, but after Kd4-c5, Qd2-d6+ is less forcing than Qa4-a5+.
- **a2c4** is a check, but after Kd4-e5, Qc4-e6+ is not as forcing.

**Conclusion:**  
**a2a4** is the most forcing move, checking the king and driving it toward the edge, which is the correct technique for converting queen vs king.

**Final move:**
```
a2a4

2025-06-12 22:50:15,192 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.34s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/q7/2K5/8/8 b - - 3 58

- Black: King on e7, Queen on a4
- White: King on c3

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black has a queen, White only has a king. This is a basic checkmate scenario, but care must be taken to avoid stalemate or perpetual checks.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- The White king is on c3, not on the edge, so no immediate mate.
- The Black queen can cut off the White king and force it to the edge.
- The Black king is close enough to help.

**Candidate moves:**
- a4a3+: Check, forces White king to b2 or c2.
- a4a1: Cuts off the first rank.
- a4a2: Cuts off the second rank.
- a4b5: Cuts off the b-file.
- e7d6: Bring king closer.

**Best plan:** Use queen to cut off the king, bring Black king closer, avoid stalemate.

**Move analysis:**
- 1... Qa3+ (a4a3): White must play Kc2 or Kd2 (but d2 is not possible), so only Kc2.
- After Kc2, Black can play Qa2+ (a3a2), forcing Kc1 or Kd1, and so on, pushing the king to the edge.
- Alternatively, Black can bring the king closer, but immediate checks are more forcing.

**Is there any stalemate risk?**
- Not at the moment, as White king has plenty of squares.

**Is there a faster way?**
- No forced mate in 1, but Qa3+ is the most forcing move.

**Final move:**
```
a4a3+
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/8/3K4/q7/8/8 b - - 5 59

- Black: King on e7, Queen on a3
- White: King on d4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black has a queen, White only has a king. This is a basic checkmate position, but the Black king is a bit far from the action. The only thing to watch for is stalemate, but White's king is not in a corner, so there are no immediate stalemate tricks.

**Goal:** Press for a swift checkmate, avoid stalemate, and don't allow any counterplay.

**Candidate moves:**
- The queen can check on a4, a7, a8, or move to cut off the White king.
- The king can move, but it's not urgent to bring it closer yet.

**Best practice:** Use the queen to restrict the White king's movement, then bring the king closer for the mate.

**Move analysis:**
- **Qa4+**: Forces the White king to c5 or e5.
- **Qa6**: Cuts off the d-file and the 6th rank, but doesn't check.
- **Qa7**: Cuts off the d-file and the 7th rank, but doesn't check.
- **Qa1**: Cuts off the first rank, but not useful.
- **Qa2**: Not useful.
- **Qa5**: Cuts off the 5th rank, but not as effective as a check.

**Qa4+** is the most forcing move, as it checks the king and pushes it further away from the center, making it easier to box in.

**Is there any stalemate risk?** No, White's king has plenty of squares.

**Conclusion:** The best move is to check with the queen and start boxing in the White king.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/8/4K3/q7/8/8/8 b - - 7 60

- Black: King on e7, Queen on a4
- White: King on e5

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black has a queen, White has only a king. This is a basic king and queen vs king endgame. The only way for White to draw is by stalemate or perpetual check, but here White has no threats.

**Objective:** The goal is to checkmate the White king as efficiently as possible, while avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- The queen should cut off the White king and force it to the edge, then to a corner, and then deliver mate.
- The Black king should help, but for now, the queen can do the work.

Let's look at the legal moves for the queen:

- a4e8: This is a good move, as it cuts off the e-file and pushes the White king toward the edge.
- a4a8: This is less effective, as it doesn't restrict the White king.
- a4d7: This is also good, as it cuts off the 7th rank and restricts the White king.
- a4a7: Similar to a4a8, not as effective.
- a4e4: This is a check, but the White king can move to f6 or d6, not ideal.
- a4d4: This is a check, but the White king can move to f5 or d5, not ideal.
- a4c4: This is a check, but the White king can move to f5 or d5, not ideal.
- a4b4: This is a check, but the White king can move to f5 or d5, not ideal.
- a4a5: This is a check, but the White king can move to f4 or d4, not ideal.

**Best move:**
- a4e8 is the most precise, as it cuts off the e-file and pushes the White king toward the edge. This is the standard technique for forcing mate with king and queen.

**Double-check for stalemate:**
- After a4e8, the White king has legal moves (f6, d6, f5, d5), so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
a4e8
```

2025-06-12 23:08:04,583 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 4.96s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 4q3/4k3/8/8/4K3/8/8/8 b - - 9 61

- Black: King on e7, Queen on e8
- White: King on e4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black has a queen and king, White only has a king. This is a basic checkmate scenario.

**Objective:** Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Legal moves:**
e8h8, e8g8, e8f8, e8d8, e8c8, e8b8, e8a8, e8f7, e8d7, e8g6, e8c6, e8h5, e8b5, e8a4, e7f8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7, e7f6, e7e6, e7d6

**Analysis:**

- The White king is on e4, near the center.
- Black's king is on e7, queen on e8.
- The goal is to restrict the White king's movement and force it to the edge, then deliver mate.

**Immediate tactics:**
- No immediate mate, but we can start restricting the White king.
- Moves like Qg6+ or Qh5+ check the king and force it to move.

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qg6+ (forces White king to f4 or d4)
2. Qh5 (no check, but restricts)
3. Qc6+ (forces White king to d4 or f4)
4. Qf8 (preparing to bring the queen closer)
5. Ke6 (bring king closer, but queen moves are more forcing)

**Best move:**
- Qg6+ is strong: it checks and restricts the king's movement, pushing it toward the edge.
- Qc6+ is similar.
- Qf8 is less forcing.

**Check for stalemate:**
- After Qg6+, White must move, so no stalemate.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is:
```
e8g6
```

2025-06-12 23:15:18,327 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 12.66s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4k3/6q1/4K3/8/8/8/8 b - - 11 62

- Black: King on e7, Queen on g6
- White: King on e5

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black has a queen, White only has a king. This is a trivially won endgame for Black, but care must be taken to avoid stalemate or perpetual check (though White has no pieces to check with).

**Objective:** Checkmate White as quickly and safely as possible.

**Candidate moves:**
- The White king is on e5, so let's see if there is a forced mate or a way to restrict the king further.

**Legal moves for Black:**
- King moves: e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f7, e7d7
- Queen moves: g6g8, g6e8, g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6b6, g6a6, g6h5, g6g5, g6f5, g6g4, g6e4, g6g3, g6d3, g6g2, g6c2, g6g1, g6b1

**Immediate threats:**
- Is there a checkmate in one? Let's check all queen moves that check the king:
    - g6g5: Qg5+ (King can go to d6, f6, d4, f4, so not mate)
    - g6g4: Qg4+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)
    - g6e4: Qe4+ (King can go to f6, d6, f4, d4, so not mate)
    - g6f6: Qf6+ (King can go to d5, d4, e4, so not mate)
    - g6e6: Qe6+ (King can go to f4, d4, f6, d6, so not mate)
    - g6d6: Qd6+ (King can go to f5, d5, f4, d4, so not mate)
    - g6f5: Qf5+ (King can go to d5, d4, e4, so not mate)
    - g6d3: Qd3+ (King can go to f4, d4, f5, so not mate)
    - g6g3: Qg3+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)
    - g6g2: Qg2+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)
    - g6g1: Qg1+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)
    - g6c2: Qc2+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)
    - g6c6: Qc6+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)
    - g6b6: Qb6+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)
    - g6a6: Qa6+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)
    - g6h6: Qh6+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)
    - g6h5: Qh5+ (King can go to d5, f5, so not mate)

So, no immediate mate in one.

**Best plan:** 
- The White king is on e5, center of the board. The best plan is to restrict the king's movement, drive it to the edge, and then deliver mate.
- The Black king is on e7, close enough to help box in the White king.

**Key squares:** 
- If we play Kf7, we cut off the f-file, but White can still move.
- If we play Qg4, we cut off the e-file and g-file, but White can still move.
- If we play Qe6+, we check and force the king to move. Let's see what happens:

1. ... Qe6+  
    - Ke4 (then Qg4+ and drive the king to the edge)
    - Kf4 (then Qf6+ and repeat)
    - Kd4 (then Qd6+ and repeat)
    - Kf6 (then Qf6+ and repeat)
    - Kd6 (then Qd6+ and repeat)
    - Kf4 (then Qf4+ and repeat)
    - Kd4 (then Qd4+ and repeat)

But all these are just checks, not forcing mate.

**What about using the king?**
- Move the king closer to help box in the White king.

If we play Kf7, the White king is still in the center. But if we play Qg4, we cut off the e-file and g-file, and the king is forced to move.

But let's look for a move that restricts the White king's movement the most.

**What about Qg4?**
- Qg4 keeps the king boxed in, and the only moves are Kd5, Kf5, Kd6, Kf6, Ke6, Ke4, Kd4, Kf4.

But Qg4 is not a check, and doesn't restrict the king as much as possible.

**What about Qg5?**
- Qg5+ is a check, and after Kd6, we can play Qf6+ and drive the king to the edge.

But let's see if we can use the king to help.

**What about Kf7?**
- Kf7 brings the king closer, but White can just move around.

**What about Qg3?**
- Qg3+ is a check, and after Kd5, we can play Qd3+ and drive the king to the edge.

**What about Qg1?**
- Qg1+ is a check, and after Kd5, we can play Qd1+ and drive the king to the edge.

But all these are just checks, not forcing mate.

**What about triangulation?**
- The best way is to use the queen to restrict the king's movement, and bring the king closer.

**Best move:**
- The most precise move is to bring the king closer, so that the queen and king can work together to box in the White king.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
e7f7
```
This brings the king closer, and prepares to box in the White king, leading to a forced mate in a few moves.

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/6q1/8/3K4/8/8/8 b - - 13 63

- Black: King on f7, Queen on g6
- White: King on d4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black is up a queen versus a lone king. This is a trivially won position for Black, but care must be taken to avoid stalemate.

**Immediate tactics:** 
- The White king is on d4, with squares c3, c4, c5, d3, d5, e3, e4, e5 available.
- The Black queen on g6 can cut off many squares.
- The Black king is on f7, far from the action but not in danger.

**Goal:** Checkmate the White king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Qg1: Cuts off the 1st rank, but not useful.
- Qg4+: Checks the king, forcing it to move.
- Qg5: Cuts off the 5th rank.
- Qg3: Cuts off the 3rd rank.
- Qd6: Cuts off the d-file.
- Qe6: Cuts off the e-file.
- Qf5: Cuts off the f-file.
- Qg2: Cuts off the 2nd rank.

**Check for immediate mate:**
- Qg4+ forces the king to move. Let's see where the king can go:
    - After Qg4+, the king can go to e5, e3, c5, c3, c4, d3, d5.
    - No immediate mate.

**Try to restrict the king:**
- Qg3: The king can't go to d3 or e3, but can still go to c5, c4, c3, d5, e5, e4.
- Qg5: The king can't go to d5 or e5, but can go to c5, c4, c3, d3, e3, e4.

**Try to bring the queen closer:**
- Qe6: Controls e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, d5, f5, f6, f7, f8, g6, h6, d6, c6, b6, a6.
- Qd6: Controls d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, c5, e5, e4, e3, f4, g4, h4, c6, b6, a6.

**Try to checkmate net:**
- The best way is to cut off the king's escape squares, then bring the king closer if needed.

**Best move:**
- Qg4+ is a forcing move. Let's check the consequences:
    - 1... Qg4+ 2. Kd5 (or Kd3, Ke5, Ke3, c5, c4, c3)
    - The king is not stalemated and must move.

Alternatively, Qe6 is a quiet move, but Qg4+ is more forcing and brings us closer to mate.

**Double-check for stalemate:**
- After Qg4+, the king has moves.

**Conclusion:** The best move is the forcing check:

```
g6g4

2025-06-12 23:26:56,516 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.25s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/8/4K3/6q1/8/8/8 b - - 15 64  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Queen on g4  
- White: King on e5

**Position:**  
- White's king is exposed on e5, Black's king is safe on f7.  
- Black's queen is very active, and White has no pieces left.  
- Black is up a queen and has a forced win, but must avoid stalemate tricks.

**Immediate threats:**  
- No stalemate yet, but if Black is careless and allows White's king to approach the queen, stalemate could occur.

**Candidate moves:**  
- All legal moves are with the queen or king.  
- The most forcing moves are checks.

Let's look for checkmate or a forced mate sequence.

**Check options:**  
- g4g5+ (Queen to g5, check)  
- g4g6+ (Queen to g6, check)  
- g4e6+ (Queen to e6, check)  
- g4e2+ (Queen to e2, check)  
- g4d1+ (Queen to d1, check)

Let's check each:

1. **g4g5+**  
   - White must move Ke4 or Kd6.  
   - If Ke4, Black can continue with Qg4+ and drive the king back.  
   - If Kd6, Qe7# is mate.

2. **g4g6+**  
   - White must move Kf4 or Kd5.  
   - If Kf4, Qg4# is mate.  
   - If Kd5, Qe6# is mate.

3. **g4e6+**  
   - White must move Kf4 or Kd5.  
   - If Kf4, Qg4# is mate.  
   - If Kd5, Qe6# is mate.

So, **g4g6+** is a forced mate in 1 or 2.

- If Ke4, Qg4# is mate.
- If Kd5, Qe6# is mate.

But let's check if there is a mate in 1:

- **g4g6+**: If Ke4, Qg4#; if Kd5, Qe6#.
- **g4g5+**: If Ke4, Qg4+; if Kd6, Qe7#.

But **g4g6+** is the most direct and forces mate next move, no matter what.

**Final move:**
```
g4g6
```

2025-06-12 23:30:19,940 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 10.07s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/6q1/8/3K4/8/8/8 b - - 17 65

- Black: King on f7, Queen on g6
- White: King on d4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black has a queen and king, White has only a king. This is a basic checkmate scenario, but care must be taken to avoid stalemate or allowing the king to escape.

**Immediate threats:** None from White, as they have only the king.

**Goal:** Checkmate the White king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- The White king is on d4, so let's see if we can restrict its movement and drive it to the edge.

Let's look at the legal moves for Black:

- f7g8 (King to g8)
- f7f8 (King to f8)
- f7e8 (King to e8)
- f7g7 (King to g7)
- f7e7 (King to e7)
- f7f6 (King to f6)
- f7e6 (King to e6)
- g6g8 (Queen to g8)
- g6h7 (Queen to h7)
- g6g7 (Queen to g7)
- g6h6 (Queen to h6)
- g6f6 (Queen to f6)
- g6e6 (Queen to e6)
- g6d6 (Queen to d6)
- g6c6 (Queen to c6)
- g6b6 (Queen to b6)
- g6a6 (Queen to a6)
- g6h5 (Queen to h5)
- g6g5 (Queen to g5)
- g6f5 (Queen to f5)
- g6g4 (Queen to g4)
- g6e4 (Queen to e4)
- g6g3 (Queen to g3)
- g6d3 (Queen to d3)
- g6g2 (Queen to g2)
- g6c2 (Queen to c2)
- g6g1 (Queen to g1)
- g6b1 (Queen to b1)

**Let's consider the best way to restrict the White king.**

If we play:
- **Qg4+** (g6g4): White must move to c5, c3, e3, or e5. But after Kc5, we can continue to restrict.
- **Qd6+** (g6d6): White must move to c4, e4, or e3. After Kc4, we can play Qd5+.
- **Qe6** (g6e6): Not a check, but covers e4 and e5.
- **Qf5** (g6f5): Not a check, but covers d5 and e4.

But let's look for a forcing move.

**1. g6g4+ (Qg4+)**
- White's legal moves: Kc5, Ke5, Ke3, Kc3.

Let's check for stalemate after Qg4+:
- Kc5: Then Qe6 (cuts off e4, e5, d5), then Kb5, then Qd5+ and so on.
- Ke5: Then Qe6+ (forces Kd4 or Kf4).
- Ke3: Then Qe4+ (forces Kd2 or Kf2).
- Kc3: Then Qd4+ (forces Kb3 or Kc2).

This move starts the process of boxing in the king.

**2. g6d6+ (Qd6+)**
- White's legal moves: Kc4, Ke4, Ke3.
- Kc4: Then Qd5+ (forces Kc3, Kb4, Kb5).
- Ke4: Then Qd5+ (forces Kf4, Kf3, Ke3).
- Ke3: Then Qe5+ (forces Kd2, Kf2).

This also restricts the king.

**3. g6e4 (Qe4)**
- Not a check, but covers e4 and e5.

**4. f7e6 (Ke6)**
- Brings the king closer, but not forcing.

**Conclusion:**
Between Qg4+ and Qd6+, both are strong. Qg4+ is more forcing and keeps the king more boxed in, as it restricts the king to the c-file or e-file, and the queen can follow up with checks to keep the king on the edge.

**Final Move:**

2025-06-12 23:32:47,280 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 8.18s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/8/4K3/6q1/8/8/8 b - - 19 66  
**Black to move.**

- Black has a queen on g4 and a king on f7.
- White has only a king on e5.
- Black is up a queen, and White has no pawns or pieces.
- The White king is exposed in the center.
- Black's queen is already on a good square, cutting off escape squares.

**Immediate tactical considerations:**
- Is there a forced mate?
- Can White escape perpetual check or stalemate?
- Is there a way to force the White king to the edge and deliver mate?

**Candidate moves:**
1. Qg5# (Check if this is mate)
2. Qe6+ (Check, forces the king to f4 or d4)
3. Qg3+ (Check, forces the king to d5 or e4)
4. Qg6 (No check, but threatens mate next)
5. Qe2 (No check, but cuts off more squares)

**Let's check each:**

- **Qg5:** Not legal, as the queen is on g4 and g5 is occupied by the queen.
- **Qg3+:** King can go to d5 or e4.
- **Qe6+:** King can go to f4 or d4.
- **Qg6:** Not a check, but threatens Qg7# if the king moves to d6 or f6 (but those are not legal for White).
- **Qe2:** Not a check, but cuts off more squares.

**Check for mate in one:**
- Qg5 is not legal.
- Qg6 is not checkmate.
- Qg3+ and Qe6+ are checks, but not mate.

**Best move:**
- Both Qg3+ and Qe6+ force the king to move. Let's check which one is more forcing.

**1. Qg3+:**
- If Ke4, then Qg4+ forces the king back to e5.
- If Kd5, then Qf5+ forces the king to d4 or e4, and so on.

**2. Qe6+:**
- If Kf4, then Qf6# is mate.
- If Kd4, then Qd6+ forces the king to e4 or c4.

**So, Qe6+ is more forcing and leads to mate faster.**

**Calculation:**
- Qe6+ Kf4 Qf6# (mate)
- Qe6+ Kd4 Qd6+ (forces the king to e4 or c4, and mate is coming soon)

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
qe6

2025-06-12 23:37:26,968 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 10.29s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/4q3/8/5K2/8/8/8 b - - 21 67  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Queen on e6  
- White: King on f4

**Position:**  
- White's king is on f4, exposed in the center.  
- Black's king is on f7, safe.  
- Black's queen is on e6, dominating the board.  
- White has no pieces left.

**Objective:**  
- Press the advantage, avoid stalemate, and aim for a swift checkmate.

**Legal moves:**  
- f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7, f7g6, f7f6, e6e8, e6c8, e6e7, e6d7, e6h6, e6g6, e6f6, e6d6, e6c6, e6b6, e6a6, e6f5, e6e5, e6d5, e6g4, e6e4, e6c4, e6h3, e6e3, e6b3, e6e2, e6a2, e6e1

**Candidate moves:**  
- The most direct way to win is to drive the White king to the edge and deliver mate with queen and king.
- Avoid stalemate (don't take away all White's moves).
- Don't allow perpetual check (not possible here, as White has no pieces).

Let's consider some candidate moves:

1. **Qf6+ (e6f6):**  
   - Forces the White king to move.  
   - If K moves to g4, then Qg6+ picks up the king further.  
   - If K moves to e4, then Qe6+ again.

2. **Qe5+ (e6e5):**  
   - Forces the king to e3 or f3.  
   - If Ke3, then Qe3# is mate.  
   - If Kf3, then Qf5+.

3. **Qh6+ (e6h6):**  
   - King has to go to f5 or e4.  
   - If Kf5, then Qg6# is mate.  
   - If Ke4, then Qe6+.

Let's check for immediate mate:

- **e6e3 (Qe3#):**  
  - Is this mate?  
  - White king on f4, Qe3 covers e3, f3, g3, e4, e5, f5, g5.  
  - But f5 is not covered, so not mate.

- **e6f6 (Qf6+):**  
  - White king must move.  
  - If Kg4, then Qg6+ and then Qg4# is possible.  
  - If Ke4, then Qe6+.

- **e6g4 (Qg4+):**  
  - White king can go to e5 or e3.

- **e6f5 (Qf5+):**  
  - White king can go to e3 or g3.

- **e6e5 (Qe5+):**  
  - White king can go to f3 or e3.

Let's check **e6e5 (Qe5+):**

- If Kf3, then Qf5+.
- If Ke3, then Qe3+.

But none of these are mate in one.

Now, let's check **e6h6 (Qh6+):**

- If Kf5, then Qg6# is mate (since g6 is protected by queen, f5 is occupied, e5 is protected, g5 is protected, f4 is occupied, g4 is protected).
- If Ke4, then Qe6+.

So, **Qh6+** is a forcing move, and if White plays Kf5, it's mate in one.

Let's check:

- 1... Qh6+  
  - 2. Kf5 Qg6#  
  - 2. Ke4 Qe6+ (and the chase continues)

Alternatively, **Qf6+**:

- 1... Qf6+  
  - 2. Kg4 Qg6+  
  - 3. Kf4 Qg4# (mate)

But White can also play Ke4, then Qe6+.

So, **Qh6+** is the most forcing, as it threatens immediate mate if White chooses Kf5.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
e6h6
```

2025-06-12 23:40:08,671 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.42s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/7q/5K2/8/8/8/8 b - - 23 68  
Black to move.

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Queen on h6  
- White: King on f5

**Position:**  
- White's king is on f5, exposed in the center.  
- Black's queen is on h6, controlling the 6th rank and the h-file.  
- Black's king is on f7, safe.  
- White has no pieces or pawns.

**Goal:**  
- Press for checkmate, avoid stalemate, and prevent any escape squares for the White king.

**Legal moves:**  
- f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7, h6h8, h6f8, h6h7, h6g7, h6g6, h6f6, h6e6, h6d6, h6c6, h6b6, h6a6, h6h5, h6g5, h6h4, h6f4, h6h3, h6e3, h6h2, h6d2, h6h1, h6c1

**Candidate moves:**  
- The White king is on f5, so let's look for checks and ways to restrict the king's movement.

**Check options:**  
- h6h5+ (Qh5+): This checks the king and forces it to move.  
- h6g6+ (Qg6+): This checks the king and forces it to move.

Let's analyze both:

1. **68... Qh5+**
    - White's only legal move is Kf4 (since e6, f6, g6, g5, e4, g4 are all covered by the queen or king).
    - After Kf4, Black can continue with Qh4+ and drive the king further.

2. **68... Qg6+**
    - White's only legal move is Ke5 (since f6, g5, f4, g4, e6, e4 are all covered).
    - After Ke5, Black can continue with Qe6+ and keep checking.

But let's check for stalemate possibilities. After Qh5+, Kf4, Qh4+, Ke3, Qg3+, Ke2, Qg2+, Ke1, Qg1#, that's a forced mate.

**Is there a faster mate?**

- Qh5+ is the most direct, and White's king is forced to the fourth rank, then the queen can keep checking and drive the king to the edge for mate.

**Stalemate check:**  
- After Qh5+, White always has a move, so no stalemate.

Therefore, the best move is:
```
h6h5
```

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/8/7q/5K2/8/8/8 b - - 25 69  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Queen on h5  
- White: King on f4

**Immediate threats:**  
- White's king is exposed.  
- Black's queen is very close and can deliver checks.  
- There are no pawns or other pieces left; this is a pure king and queen vs king endgame.

**Objective:**  
- The goal is to checkmate the White king as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**  
- The queen can move along the 5th rank, or deliver checks from h4, h3, h2, h1, etc.  
- The king can move, but the queen is the main weapon.

**Key considerations:**  
- Avoid stalemate (White king must have at least one legal move until mate is forced).  
- Use the queen and king together to drive the White king to the edge and then to a corner.

**Best move calculation:**  
- The White king is on f4.  
- The Black queen on h5 can check with Qh4+, forcing the White king to e5 or f3 or g3.  
- Qh4+ is forcing and keeps the initiative.

Let's check Qh4+:

1. ... Qh4+  
   - If 2. Ke5, then Qg5+ drives the king further.  
   - If 2. Kf3, then Qg5 keeps the king boxed in.  
   - If 2. Kg3, then Qg5+ again.

**Alternative moves:**  
- Moving the king (f7-g6, etc.) is too slow and gives White unnecessary moves.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to check with the queen and continue the process of boxing in the White king.

**Final move:**
```
h5h4+

2025-06-12 23:49:09,752 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 13.54s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/8/4K3/7q/8/8/8 b - - 27 70  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Queen on h4  
- White: King on e5

**Position:**  
- White's king is on e5, exposed in the center.  
- Black's queen is on h4, cutting off the 4th rank and controlling many squares.  
- Black's king is on f7, safe.  
- White has no pieces left.

**Objective:**  
- Press for a swift checkmate.  
- Avoid stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**  
- h4e7+ (check, forces the king to d5 or f5)
- h4g5+ (check, king must go to d4 or e4)
- h4h5 (waiting move, but not necessary)
- h4g4 (check, king must go to d5 or f5)
- h4e1 (no check, but not useful)
- h4h3 (no check, not useful)

**Let's check h4e7+:**  
1. ... Qe7+  
   - If Kf5: Qf6# (mate)
   - If Kd5: Qe6+ (forces Ke4, then Qe5#)

**Let's check h4g5+:**  
1. ... Qg5+  
   - If Ke6: Qf6# (mate)
   - If Kd6: Qe7# (mate)
   - If Kd5: Qe7# (mate)
   - If Ke4: Qe5#

But White's king is on e5, so after Qg5+, only Ke6 and Kd6 are possible, but both are not legal (king is on e5, can't go to e6 or d6). So Qg5+ is not a check.

**Let's check h4e7+:**  
- e7 is on the same diagonal as e5, so Qe7+ is a check.

After Qe7+, White's only legal moves are Kf5 or Kd5.

- If Kf5: Qf6# (mate)
- If Kd5: Qe6+ (forces Ke4, then Qe5#)

So, Qe7+ is the fastest way to force mate.

**Final move:**
```
h4e7
```

2025-06-12 23:53:05,373 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.28s):
Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/4qk2/8/3K4/8/8/8/8 b - - 29 71  
Black to move.

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Queen on e7  
- White: King on d5

**Position:**  
- Black's king is on f7, queen on e7.  
- White's king is on d5, with no pawns or pieces.

**Objective:**  
- Black is up a queen and should aim for a swift checkmate, avoiding stalemate.

**Immediate threats:**  
- No immediate threats from White; Black must avoid stalemate (i.e., don't leave White's king with no legal moves unless it's checkmate).

**Candidate moves:**  
- The queen can cut off the White king and force it to the edge, then deliver mate.
- Moves like Qe6+, Qg5+, Qd7+, Qb7+, etc., are possible.
- The king can also approach, but the queen is more effective for driving the king.

**Check for stalemate:**  
- If the queen moves to a square that cuts off all escape squares but does not check, and the king is not in check, it could be stalemate. We must avoid that.

**Best plan:**  
- Use the queen to check and drive the king to the edge, then mate.

**Move calculation:**  
1. Qe6+ forces the king to c5 or d4 or e4.
   - If Kd4, then Qe3+ (drives further).
   - If Kc5, then Qe5+ (drives to b6 or c4).
2. Qg5+ is similar.
3. Qd7+ is also possible.

But let's check Qe6+:

- 71...Qe6+  
  - 72. Kd4 Qe3+ (forces Kd5 or c4)
  - 72. Kc5 Qe5+ (forces Kc4 or b6)
  - 72. Kd6 Qd7+ (forces Kc5 or e5)

All these keep the king in the box and avoid stalemate.

**Is there a forced mate?**  
Not immediate, but Qe6+ is the most forcing and keeps the king boxed.

**Is there a better move?**  
- Qd7+ is similar, but Qe6+ is more central and flexible.

**Final move:**  
```
e7e6

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/4q3/8/3K4/8/8/8 b - - 31 72

- Black: King on f7, Queen on e6
- White: King on d4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black has a queen and king, White only a king. This is a basic checkmate scenario, but care must be taken to avoid stalemate or accidental perpetual check.

**Objective:** Checkmate the White king as efficiently as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- The White king is on d4, with escape squares c5, c4, c3, d3, e3, e4, e5, d5. But many of these are controlled by the Black queen or king.
- The Black king is on f7, not close enough to help immediately, but can approach.
- The Black queen can check or restrict the White king.

**Immediate checks:**
- Qd6+ (e6d6): King must move to c4, c3, or e4.
- Qe5+ (e6e5): King must move to c4, e3, or d3.
- Qd7+ (e6d7): King must move to c5 or c3.
- Qb6+ (e6b6): King must move to c4 or c3.

But let's check for stalemate risk:
- If Black plays Qd6+, White's only move is Ke4 (since c3 and c4 are controlled by the queen).
- If Black plays Qe5+, White can play Kc4, Ke3, or Kd3.

But let's look for the most forcing move that restricts the White king's mobility and brings us closer to mate.

**Best move:**
- Qd6+ (e6d6) is a strong candidate, as it forces the White king to e4 (the only legal move), after which Black can continue to check and restrict.

Let's double-check for stalemate:
- After Qd6+, if White plays Ke4, Black can play Qd5+ (forcing Kf4 or Ke3), and so on, gradually forcing the king to the edge.

**Alternative:**
- Qe7 is not a check and doesn't restrict the king.
- Qf6 is not a check and doesn't restrict the king.
- Qf5 is not a check and doesn't restrict the king.

**Conclusion:**
The best move is to check with the queen and restrict the White king's movement. Qd6+ is the most forcing and safe move.

**Final move:**
```
e6d6

Let's analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/3q4/8/4K3/8/8/8 b - - 33 73

- Black: King on f7, Queen on d6
- White: King on e4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black has a queen and king, White only has a king. This is a basic checkmate scenario, but care must be taken to avoid stalemate.

**Objective:** Checkmate the White king as quickly and safely as possible.

**Candidate moves:**
- The White king is on e4, so let's look for checks and ways to restrict the king.
- d6e6+ is a check, forcing the king to d5 or f4.
- d6g6+ is a check, forcing the king to f5 or d5.
- d6e7, d6e5, etc., are not checks but can restrict the king.

**Let's check d6e6+:**
- 1... Qe6+ 2. Kd4 (if 2. Kf4, then Qf6+ and the king is forced back)
- After 2. Kd4, Black can play Qd6+ and repeat, but that's not progressing.

**What about d6g6+:**
- 1... Qg6+ 2. Kf4 (if 2. Kd5, then Qe6+ and the king is forced back)
- After 2. Kf4, Qf6+ again restricts the king.

**What about d6e7:**
- This move restricts the king's movement, keeping the queen close.

**What about d6c5:**
- This cuts off the king from the d-file and c-file, but doesn't check.

**What about d6e5+:**
- 1... Qe5+ 2. Kf3 or Kd3, and then Qf5+ or Qd5+.

**Best plan:** Use the queen to cut off the king and force it to the edge, then deliver mate.

**But is there a forced mate?**
- Let's try 1... Qg6+ 2. Kf4 Qf6+ 3. Ke4 (if Kg4, Qg5# is mate)
- 3. Ke4 Qe6+ 4. Kd4 Qd6+ 5. Ke4 Qd4#

But after 1... Qg6+, if 2. Kd5, then Qe6+ and repeat.

**Is there a direct mate?**
- No, but Qg6+ is the most forcing move, as it restricts the king and keeps the queen close.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is to check with the queen and keep the king restricted. Qg6+ is the most precise, as it forces the king to the f-file or d-file, and then Black can continue to check and push the king to the edge for mate.

**Final move:**
```

2025-06-13 00:03:37,406 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.67s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/6q1/4K3/8/8/8/8 b - - 35 74  
**Black to move.**

**Material:**  
- Black: King on f7, Queen on g6  
- White: King on e5

**Position:**  
- White's king is on e5, exposed in the center.  
- Black's king is on f7, safe.  
- Black's queen is on g6, controlling many squares around the white king.

**Objective:**  
- Press for a swift checkmate, avoid stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**  
Let's look for forced mates or moves that drive the white king to a mating net.

1. **Qf6+**: Forces the white king to d5 or e4.
2. **Qg5+**: Forces the white king to d6 or e4.
3. **Qe6+**: Forces the white king to f4 or d4.
4. **Qh5+**: Forces the white king to f4 or d4.

But let's check if any move leads to immediate mate or a forced mate in a few moves.

### Calculation

#### 1. Qf6+  
- If Ke4, then ...Qe6# (mate).
- If Kd5, then ...Qe6+ (and after Kd4, ...Qe5#).

So, **Qf6+** looks like a forced mate in two.

Let's check:

- 74... Qf6+  
    - 75. Ke4 Qe6#  
    - 75. Kd5 Qe6+ 76. Kd4 Qe5#  

This is a forced mate in two.

#### 2. Qg5+  
- 75. Kd6 Qe7+ 76. Kd5 Qe6#  
- 75. Ke4 Qe7+ 76. Kf5 Qe6#  
But this is not as direct as Qf6+.

#### 3. Qe6+  
- 75. Kf4 Qf6#  
- 75. Kd4 Qe5#  
Again, mate in one after Kf4 or Kd4.

But Qf6+ is the most forcing and direct.

### Conclusion

**Best move:**  
```
Qf6+
```

But in UCI notation, that's `g6f6`.

**Final answer:**
```
g6f6
```

- The White king is on d5, so let's see if we can force it to the edge and deliver mate.
- The Black king is on f7, so it can help box in the White king.
- The Black queen is on f6, controlling many squares.

**Legal moves for Black:**
- King moves: f7-g8, f7-f8, f7-e8, f7-g7, f7-e7, f7-g6, f6-h8, f6-d8, f6-g7, f6-e7, f6-h6, f6-g6, f6-e6, f6-d6, f6-c6, f6-b6, f6-a6, f6-g5, f6-f5, f6-e5, f6-h4, f6-f4, f6-d4, f6-f3, f6-c3, f6-f2, f6-b2, f6-f1, f6-a1

**Let's consider the best move:**

- The White king is on d5, so let's try to cut it off from escaping to the c-file or e-file.
- Moving the queen to f4 (Qf4) would cut off the c4, d4, e4, c5, e5 squares, but allows the king to move to c6 or e6.
- Moving the queen to e6+ (Qe6+) checks the king, forcing it to c5, d4, or e4.
- Moving the queen to f5+ (Qf5+) checks the king, forcing it to c6, d6, e6, or e5.
- Moving the queen to h4 (Qh4) is not as forcing.

But the most forcing move is to check the king and drive it toward the edge.

**If 1... Qe6+**
- 2. Kc5 (if Kd4, then Qe5# is mate; if Ke4, then Qxe5# is mate)
- 2... Qe5+ (if Kc6, then Qc7# is mate; if Kb6, then Qb8# is mate)

But let's check for stalemate traps.

**Let's play 1... Qe6+**

- If 2. Kd4, then Qe5# is mate.
- If 2. Ke4, then Qxe5# is mate.
- If 2. Kc5, then Qe5+ again, and the king is forced to c6 or b6, and then Qc7# or Qb8# is mate.

**Therefore, the best move is:**
```
qe6
```

2025-06-13 00:12:28,129 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 5.75s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/4q3/8/3K4/8/8/8 b - - 39 76

- Black: King on f7, Queen on e6
- White: King on d4

**Material:** Black has a queen and king, White has only a king.

**Objective:** Deliver checkmate as quickly and safely as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Key points:**
- White king is on d4, near the center.
- Black king is on f7, far enough to avoid stalemate blunders.
- Black queen is on e6, controlling many squares.

**Immediate candidate moves:**
1. Qd6+ (forces the king to move, keeps pressure)
2. Qf5 (cuts off escape squares)
3. Qe7 (waits, but not forcing)
4. Qg4 (cuts off more squares)
5. Qb6 (cuts off the b-file)
6. Qe1 (waiting move)

**Check for stalemate:**
- White king has several moves, so no stalemate risk.

**Best plan:** Use queen and king to push the white king to the edge, then deliver mate. But since the white king is still in the center, we should keep checking and cutting off squares.

**Analysis of Qd6+:**
- Qd6+ forces the white king to c5, e5, or c4, e4, c3, e3, etc.
- After Qd6+, if Kc5, then Qe5+ forces the king back.
- If Ke4, then Qe6+ repeats.
- This is the standard technique to drive the king to the edge.

**Is there a faster mate?**
- No immediate forced mate, but Qd6+ is the most forcing move, keeping the king restricted.

**Conclusion:** The best move is:
```
e6d6
```

Let's carefully analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black: King on f7, Queen on d6
- White: King on e4

**Material:** Black is up a queen for nothing. White has only the king.

**Immediate threats:** There are no immediate threats from White, as White has only the king.

**Objective:** Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**
- Queen checks: d6e6+, d6d4+, d6e5+, d6f4+, d6g3+, d6d2+, d6d1+
- King moves: f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7, f7g6, f7f6, f7e6

**Key considerations:**
- Avoid stalemate (don't box the king in with no moves unless it's mate).
- Use queen and king together to force the king to the edge and then deliver mate.
- The white king is on e4, center of the board. Black's king is on f7, queen on d6.

**Best plan:** Use the queen to cut off the white king's escape squares, then bring the king closer if needed.

**Tactical check:** 
- d6e6+ forces the white king to d4 or f4 or f3 or d3 (since e5 is covered by queen, e3 by queen, f5 by queen, d5 by queen).
- d6e5+ is similar.
- d6d4+ forces the king to f5, f3, d3, d5, e3, e5 (but d4 is occupied by queen, so not possible).
- d6e6+ seems best, as it checks and restricts the white king.

**Check for stalemate:** After d6e6+, White has moves.

**Alternative:** d6f4+ also checks, but then king can go to d5, d3, e3, f3, g3, g4, g5, f5, e5. Not as restrictive.

**Conclusion:** The move d6e6+ is the most forcing and restricts the white king.

**Final move:**
```
d6e6
```

2025-06-13 00:22:38,909 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.20s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/4q3/8/5K2/8/8/8 b - - 43 78

- Black: King on f7, Queen on e6
- White: King on f4

It's Black to move.

**Material:** Black has a queen and king, White only has a king. This is a basic king and queen vs king endgame.

**Objective:** The goal is to checkmate the White king as efficiently as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**White's King:** f4. Black's King: f7. Black's Queen: e6.

**Legal Moves:** All queen moves, and king moves.

**Immediate Tactics:**
- Is there a forced mate? No immediate mate, but we can drive the White king to the edge and then to a corner.
- Avoid stalemating the White king.

**Candidate Moves:**
1. Qf6+ (forces White king to g4 or e4)
2. Qh6 (cuts off the 6th rank, but not as forcing)
3. Qe7 (cuts off the 7th rank, but not as forcing)
4. King moves (not as effective as queen moves for driving the king)

**Analysis:**
- Qf6+ is a check. White must move the king.
    - If K moves to g4, then Qg6+ follows, driving the king further.
    - If K moves to e4, then Qe6+ follows, driving the king back.

This is the standard technique for king and queen vs king: use the queen to check and cut off ranks/files, drive the king to the edge, then to the corner, then deliver mate.

**Is there a risk of stalemate?**
- No, since White's king has several escape squares.

**Best Move:** Qf6+ is the most forcing and efficient.

**Final move:**
```
e6f6
```

2025-06-13 00:24:36,717 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 6.72s):
Let's analyze the position:

**Position (Black to move):**
- Black: King on f7, Queen on f6
- White: King on g3

**Material:** Black has a queen and king, White has only a king.

**Objective:** Checkmate White as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**White King on g3:** 
- Escape squares: h3, h4, g4, f4, f3, f2, h2, f2 (some covered by queen, some by king).

**Candidate moves:**
- f6g5+ (forces White king to h3 or f3)
- f6e5+ (forces White king to f3 or h4)
- f6g7 (waiting move)
- f6e7 (waiting move)
- f6g8 (waiting move)
- f6h8 (waiting move)
- f7g8 (move king closer)
- f7e8 (move king closer)
- f7g7 (move king closer)
- f7e7 (move king closer)

**Immediate checks:**
- Qg5+ (forces Kg2 or Kh3)
- Qe5+ (forces Kg2 or Kh4)

But let's check for stalemate risk: If we check with Qg5+, White can only go to h3 or f3. Both are not stalemate, so it's safe.

**Best plan:** Use queen and king to force the white king to the edge and deliver mate.

**Calculation:**
1. Qg5+ Kg2 (if Kg3-h3, then Qh5# is mate)
2. ... Qg5+ Kg2
3. ... Qg3+ Kh1 (if Kg4, then Qg4# is mate)
4. ... Qg4+ Kh2
5. ... Qg2#

But let's check if Qg5+ is the fastest.

If Qg5+ and White plays Kh3:
- Qh5# is mate.

If Qg5+ and White plays Kf3:
- Qf5+ forces Ke2 or Kg2, and so on.

**Therefore, Qg5+ is the fastest way to mate.**

**Final move:**
```
f6g5

2025-06-13 00:29:31,521 - INFO - Raw response from Black (gpt-4.1) (took 9.48s):
Let's carefully analyze the position:

**FEN:** 8/5k2/8/6q1/8/5K2/8/8 b - - 47 80  
Black to move.

**Material:**  
- Black: Queen on g5, King on f7  
- White: King on f3

**Position:**  
- Black is up a queen, White has only a king.
- The Black king is safe on f7.
- The queen is on g5, cutting off the White king's escape squares.
- The White king is on f3, with no pawns or pieces.

**Objective:**  
- Deliver checkmate as quickly as possible, avoiding stalemate.

**Candidate moves:**  
Let's look for forced mates or moves that force the White king to the edge, while avoiding stalemate.

**Legal moves:**  
- f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7, f7g6, f7f6, f7e6, g5g8, g5d8, g5g7, g5e7, g5h6, g5g6, g5f6, g5h5, g5f5, g5e5, g5d5, g5c5, g5b5, g5a5, g5h4, g5g4, g5f4, g5g3, g5e3, g5g2, g5d2, g5g1, g5c1

**Analysis:**

- **g5g6:** Queen stays on the same diagonal as the king, keeping control. But doesn't force the king anywhere.
- **g5f6:** Queen moves closer, but doesn't check.
- **g5h4:** Queen cuts off more squares, but doesn't check.
- **g5f4:** Queen checks the king. Let's see what happens:
    - 1... Qf4+ 2. Ke2 (only move) Qe4+ 3. Kd2 Qd4+ 4. Kc2 Qc4+ 5. Kb2 Qb4+ 6. Ka2 Qb2# (if the king goes to the edge)
    - But after 1... Qf4+ 2. Ke2, Black can continue checking and force the king to the edge.

- **g5g1:** Queen to g1, cuts off the first rank, but doesn't check.

- **g5g3:** Queen to g3, attacks the king, but not a check.

- **g5e5:** Queen to e5, cuts off more squares.

- **g5f6:** Queen to f6, not a check.

- **g5g4:** Queen to g4, not a check.

- **g5h4:** Queen to h4, not a check.

- **g5g7:** Queen to g7, not a check.

- **g5e3:** Queen to e3, not a check.

- **g5f4:** Queen to f4, check.

**Best move:**  
- **g5f4+** is a check, and forces the White king to the second rank, after which Black can continue to check and force the king to the edge, leading to a basic queen and king checkmate.

**Is there a faster mate?**  
- Let's check if there is a mate in one: No, the king is not on the edge.
- Is there a mate in two? Not directly, but Qf4+ is the fastest way to force the king to the edge.

**Conclusion:**  
The best move is:
```
g5f4
```

This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want, but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.
