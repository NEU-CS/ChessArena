2025-06-30 14:32:29,557 - INFO - Raw response from Black (doubao-1.5-lite_blitz) (took 9.43s):
1. Analyze the position:
   - White has developed a bishop to c4 and a knight to f3, and has advanced the e - pawn to e4. Black has responded with similar pawn and knight moves.
   - The center is somewhat blocked by the pawns on e4 and e5.
   - White's bishop on c4 is targeting the f7 - square, which is a potential weakness in Black's position.
2. Consider candidate moves:
   - **f6g4**:
     - This move attacks White's knight on f3. If White moves the knight, it disrupts their early development. For example, if 4. Nf3 g4 5. Ne5, then Black can play 5... d6, attacking the knight on e5.
     - It also opens up the g - file for Black's rook in case White castles kingside.
   - **f6d5**:
     - This move exchanges the knight for White's bishop on c4. Exchanging pieces can simplify the position. After 4. Nf3 f6 5. Bc4 f6d5, White has to recapture with either the pawn (5. Bxd5 exd5) or the knight (5. Nxd5). If White recaptures with the pawn, Black can then play 6... Nc6, further developing and putting pressure on the d - pawn.
   - **f6g8**:
     - This move retreats the knight to a more passive position. It doesn't actively challenge White's pieces or improve Black's position as much as the other two options.
3. Select the best move:
   - The move f6d5 is a good choice as it exchanges a minor piece and simplifies the position. It also helps Black to develop the c - knight and put pressure on the d - pawn.

```
f6d5

2025-06-30 14:33:23,313 - INFO - Raw response from Black (doubao-1.5-lite_blitz) (took 8.16s):
Let's analyze the position:

White has just played d4xd5, capturing our pawn on d5. Our knight on f6 is under attack. If we move the knight, we need to consider how it will affect the rest of our position.

If we play Nf6xd5, we regain the pawn, but then White can play Bc1xd5 and we have opened up the c - file for White's rook.

Another option is to develop a piece. If we play Bc8g4, we attack White's knight on f3. This forces White to make a decision about how to defend the knight. If White moves the knight, we can then consider capturing the pawn on d5 with our knight or bishop depending on White's response.

If we play Bc8g4, White has several options:
1. If White moves Nf3g5, we can play h7h6, forcing the knight to retreat. Then we can consider capturing on d5.
2. If White moves Nf3e5, we can play d7d6, preparing to recapture on d5 if White exchanges on e5.
3. If White moves Nf3d2 to defend the knight, we can play Bg4xf3, Qd8xf3 and then look to regain the pawn on d5.

After careful consideration, the best move seems to be:
```
Bc8g4
```
