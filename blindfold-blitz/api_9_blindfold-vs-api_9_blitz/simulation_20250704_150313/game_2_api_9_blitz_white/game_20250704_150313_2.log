2025-07-04 15:03:27,356 - INFO - 

You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-07-04 15:03:42,075 - INFO - Raw response from White (api_9_blitz) (took 14.72s):
The current position is the starting position of a chess game. As White, I need to choose a strong opening move that adheres to sound opening principles: controlling the center, developing pieces, and ensuring king safety.

Let's analyze some of the candidate moves:
- **g1h3**: This move develops the knight but to a less - active square compared to other options. It doesn't immediately contribute to central control.
- **g1f3**: A good developing move for the knight, but there are more central - focused alternatives.
- **b1c3**: Develops the knight but doesn't directly target the center.
- **b1a3**: This is a less common developing move as it doesn't contribute much to central control or immediate piece activity.
- **h2h3/h2h4/g2g3/g2g4/f2f3/f2f4**: These pawn moves are either too passive (h2h3) or don't contribute significantly to central control in the opening stage.
- **e2e3/d2d3/c2c3/b2b3/a2a3**: These are pawn moves that develop the pawn structure but don't immediately bring a piece into play for central control.
- **e2e4**: This is a classic and strong opening move. It immediately stakes a claim in the center, opens up lines for the queen and the bishop on f1, and follows the principle of controlling the most important squares on the board right from the start.
- **d2d4**: Another excellent central - controlling move. It also opens up lines for the queen and the bishop on c1 and gives White a strong central presence.
- **c2c4**: While it contributes to central control, it is a bit less direct compared to e2e4 and d2d4 in terms of opening up lines for the major pieces.
- **b2b4/a2a4**: These moves are too passive and don't contribute to central control in the opening.

Among these, both e2e4 and d2d4 are very strong moves. However, e2e4 is the most common and aggressive first move, often leading to dynamic and open positions where White can press for an advantage.
