You are an expert chess player. You are playing a game of chess. You are playing as White.
This is a critically urgent match. You must thoroughly analyze the position and play with utmost caution. Leverage your wisdom to secure victory.
When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.
When at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.
Meticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Considering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.
When you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:
```
<move>
```

For example:
```
e2e4
```
You can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.

2025-07-04 14:32:28,167 - INFO - Raw response from White (deepseek-v3_blitz) (took 16.26s):
Let me analyze this starting position carefully. As White, I have several reasonable options to begin the game:
1. Pawn moves (e4, d4, c4, Nf3 are most common in high-level play):
   - e2e4: Opens diagonals for bishop and queen, controls center
   - d2d4: Solid center control, prepares for queen's bishop development
   - c2c4: English opening, controls d5
   - f2f4: Bird's opening, less common but playable
2. Knight moves:
   - g1f3: Develops knight toward center, prepares for castling
   - b1c3: Develops knight but blocks c pawn
3. Other pawn moves (h3, g3, a3 etc.) are playable but less ambitious in this context.
Considering this is a critically urgent match where I must play for maximum advantage:
- e2e4 is the most aggressive and direct move, immediately fighting for central control and opening lines for development.
- d2d4 is also very strong but leads to more closed positions.
- g1f3 is solid but doesn't fight for center as directly.
The move e2e4 gives me the most options going forward and puts immediate pressure on Black. It's statistically the most successful first move at all levels of play.
After e4, I can follow up with d4 (leading to classical structures) or develop pieces flexibly. This move also allows for quick kingside castling and rapid development.
Therefore, the best move is:
```
e2e4
```
