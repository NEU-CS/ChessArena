It gives Black good counterplay and development options.\n\nLet me check if there are any immediate tactical threats:\n- White has no immediate threats after c5\n- Black can develop pieces naturally\n\nThe Sicilian Defense (c5) is the best move here as it:\n1. Challenges White's center\n2. Opens lines for Black's pieces\n3. Gives Black good counterplay\n4. Is a well-known and theoretically sound opening\n\n```\nc7c5\n```",
