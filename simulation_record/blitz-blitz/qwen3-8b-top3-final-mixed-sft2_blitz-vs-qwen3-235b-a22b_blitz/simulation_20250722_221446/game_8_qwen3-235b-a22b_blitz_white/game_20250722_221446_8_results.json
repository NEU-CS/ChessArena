It immediately stakes a claim in the center, facilitates rapid development (Bc1 and Qd1), and has the highest winning percentage in practice at all levels.\n- It avoids passive setups and gives no easy equality to Black \u2014 any response from Black must now react to the central tension.\n\nThis move aligns with all opening principles:  \n\u2705 Center control  \n\u2705 Piece development potential  \n\u2705 Flexibility  \n\nNo need to overthink \u2014 this is the best move in the position.\n\n```\ne2e4\n```",

Avoid premature queen moves or knight hops to the edge unless there's a strong tactical reason (there isn't).\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal list, we must choose the **best developing move**.\n\nTop candidates:\n- **b1c3** \u2014 Develops knight to a strong central square, supports d4, natural.\n- **g1f3** \u2014 Also develops knight to f3, controls e5 and d4, prepares kingside castling \u2014 *very common*.\n- **f1c4** \u2014 Italian Opening! Immediate pressure on f7, aggressive and classical.\n- **f1b5** \u2014 Ruy L\u00f3pez! Targets the knight that will likely go to c6 \u2014 also excellent.\n- Others like d2d4 (center expansion), c2c3 (preparing d4), or queen/bishop to edge (like d1h5, f1a6) are less principled here.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- **g1f3** is the most popular and flexible. It doesn\u2019t commit the bishop yet and keeps options open (Italian, Ruy L\u00f3pez, or even Four Knights).\n- **f1c4** is also excellent \u2014 Italian Game \u2014 and very aggressive. But it fixes the bishop early.\n- **f1b5** (Ruy L\u00f3pez) is slightly less immediate since Black hasn\u2019t played ...Nc6 yet.\n- Queen moves like d1h5 are premature and can be chased by ...Nc6 or ...g6.\n- Knight to c3 is good but slightly less urgent than Nf3, which directly eyes e5.\n\n### Best Move:\n**g1f3** \u2014 develops a knight, controls key central squares (e5 and d4), supports the e4 pawn, and is the most principled, flexible, and historically strongest second move in this position.\n\n```\ng1f3\n```",

It keeps options open and does not allow White to gain a tempo.\n- **Nf6** is also playable, but after Nxe5, White can play d4, gaining space.\n- **Bc5** is premature, as White can play d4, gaining space and tempo.\n- **Bb4+** is not very effective here, as White can block easily.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to develop the queenside knight to c6, attacking e4 and preparing to castle.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb8c6\n```",

We have several legal moves, but we must choose the best one \u2014 not just any legal move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Center: White has a pawn on e4, Black on e5 \u2014 tension exists.\n- Development: White has only the knight on f3 developed; Black has knight on c6.\n- Black just played Nc6, attacking the e4 pawn.\n- White must respond to the threat: **e4 is under attack by Nc6**.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWe must either:\n1. **Defend e4**, or  \n2. **Capture on e5**, exploiting the fact that after ...Nc6, the e5 pawn is only defended by the queen \u2014 if we take, Black must recapture with ...Qd8, losing tempo.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most promising options:\n\n#### 1. **f3e5** \u2014 Knight takes on e5\n- After `f3e5`, Black must play `...Qd8xe5` to recapture.\n- This gives White a central advantage, forces Black to move the queen early (loses tempo), and opens the center for White\u2019s development.\n- Very strong and common in this line \u2014 known as the **Paulsen Attack** or simply a central strike.\n\n#### 2. **b1c3** \u2014 Develop the knight\n- Defends e4, continues development.\n- Solid, classical, but less aggressive than f3e5.\n\n#### 3. Other moves like d2d4, c2c4, or h2h3 are slower \u2014 they don\u2019t address the immediate threat or opportunity.\n\n### Why f3e5 is best:\n- It turns a potential weakness (e4 under attack) into a strength.\n- Gains time by forcing the queen to move.\n- Leads to a slight edge for White with active play.\n- Avoids passive development when a sharp, forcing option is available.\n\nNo other move gives White such a clear edge this early.\n\n### Final Decision:\n```\nf3e5\n```",

Nxe5 Ne5  \n\nWhite\u2019s knight on e5 is currently **undefended** \u2014 it's hanging!  \nBlack has not yet capitalized on this \u2014 perhaps a blunder by Black?\n\nLet\u2019s verify:  \n- White knight on e5  \n- No white piece defends it  \n- Black has queen on d8, bishop on c8, pawn on d7 \u2014 all can potentially attack e5  \n- Most importantly, **Black\u2019s queen can play Qd8\u2013e7 or Qd8\u2013h4+**, but more directly:  \n  - **Black can play ...Qh4+**, but that doesn\u2019t attack e5 directly.  \n  - **...Qe7** would attack the knight on e5 \u2014 and it\u2019s a free piece!\n\nSo yes \u2014 **the knight on e5 is hanging**, and Black missed it.\n\nThis is a **tactical gift** \u2014 White must retreat or lose the knight.\n\nWhite\u2019s legal moves include many options \u2014 but we must prioritize **saving the knight on e5**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the legal moves again:\n- `h1g1` \u2013 castles kingside \u2705\n- `f1a6`, `f1b5`, `f1c4`, `f1d3`, `f1e2` \u2013 bishop moves\n- `e1e2` \u2013 king to e2\n- `d1h5`, `d1g4`, `d1f3`, `d1e2` \u2013 queen moves\n- Various pawn and knight moves like `b1c3`, `d2d4`, etc.\n\nWhich of these **saves the knight on e5**?\n\nOnly moves that either:\n1. **Retreat the knight** \u2014 but no legal knight move from e5 is listed \u2014 because the knight has already moved and now it's White\u2019s turn \u2014 wait: the knight is already on e5, and it's White to move \u2014 so we must move something else to protect it or retreat it.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the knight on e5 is White\u2019s piece. Can we move it away?  \nNo legal move in the list starts with `e5...` \u2014 so the knight cannot move \u2014 meaning it\u2019s truly **hanging**.\n\nSo we must **protect it** or **lose it**.\n\nHow can we protect it?\n- Queen to f3 (`d1f3`) \u2014 protects e5 \u2705\n- Queen to e2 (`d1e2`) \u2014 does not protect e5\n- King to e2 (`e1e2`) \u2014 no\n- Bishop to d3 (`f1d3`) \u2014 no\n- Knight to c3 (`b1c3`) \u2014 no\n\nOnly **Queen to f3** (`d1f3`) protects the knight on e5.\n\nIs that safe?\n- After `d1f3`, the queen is on f3, protecting e5.\n- Black\u2019s best reply would be `...Qe7`, attacking the queen \u2014 but then White can play `Qf3\u2013e2` or `Qf3\u2013g3`, and still retain the knight.\n- Alternatively, Black might play `...d6`, kicking the knight \u2014 but that would be slow.\n\nBut most importantly: **if we don\u2019t play d1f3, we lose the knight for free** \u2014 a full piece.\n\nSo this is not a choice \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity.\n\n**Best and only move to avoid losing material:**  \n\ud83d\udc49 `d1f3`\n\n```\nd1f3\n```",

That would waste the opportunity to punish Black for the premature ...Nf6+.\n\n**Why not other queen moves?**\n- `f3g3`, `f3e3`, etc. retreat and let Black play ...Be7 or ...Bc5, castle, and equalize easily.\n- No initiative gained \u2014 just a normal position.\n- We have a chance to strike now \u2014 take the knight, open the g-file, and pressure the exposed king.\n\nThis is a classic case of **removing the defender and opening lines against the enemy king**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is to capture the knight on f6 \u2014 it\u2019s a strong, forcing move that gives White a clear edge due to Black\u2019s exposed king.\n\n```\nf3f6\n```",

The key considerations are:\n1. White's queen is attacking our knight on e5\n2. We need to protect our king while developing our pieces\n3. We should look for moves that either defend our knight or create counterplay\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- e5g6: This would move the knight to g6, but it's a bad square as it's attacked by White's bishop on c1\n- e5c6: Moving to c6 is better, but it's still somewhat exposed\n- e5g4: This seems risky as it moves the knight to a more vulnerable square\n- e5c4: Similar to c6 but even more exposed\n- e5f3: This would be a blunder as it walks into White's queen\n- e5d3: Also a blunder as it walks into the queen\n- g7f6: This would capture White's queen but is a terrible idea as it loses material (we'd be down a queen for a pawn)\n\nThe best move appears to be e5c6, moving the knight to c6. This:\n1. Protects the knight from White's queen\n2. Develops the knight to a good square where it attacks White's pawn on d4\n3. Maintains pressure on White's position\n4. Doesn't walk into any immediate traps\n\nOther options like f8e7 (developing the bishop) or d8e7 (queen move) don't address the immediate threat to the knight.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5c6\n```",

Qf6**, a very aggressive queen sacrifice. Let's assess the position:\n\n### Material:\n- White has sacrificed the queen for a pawn.\n- Black has not developed much \u2014 king still in center, rooks undeveloped, bishop on c8 still trapped.\n- White still has both rooks, both bishops, and all pawns except one.\n\n### Tactical Situation:\nThe white queen is on f6, attacking:\n- The black king directly \u2014 it's check if the queen can't be captured.\n- But it's not check \u2014 it's a **discovered attack** waiting to happen.\n\nBlack's last move was **5...Nc6**, returning the knight to c6 after capturing on e5 earlier. Now, the knight is back, but the king is still stuck in the center.\n\n### Key Observation:\nThe black king is on e8, with no escape square yet. The only piece that can legally capture the queen is the knight on c6 \u2014 but if it does, **White wins the black queen with Qxd8+**, because after Nc6xf6, the queen on d8 is undefended!\n\nLet\u2019s test that:\n\n**If 6...Nxf6??**, then **7. Qxd8+ Kxd8**, and White is up a queen for a knight \u2014 a huge material advantage.\n\nSo Black **cannot** take the queen \u2014 it\u2019s a **poisoned piece**.\n\nTherefore, the queen on f6 is **untouchable** \u2014 any capture leads to immediate loss of the black queen.\n\n### What can Black do?\nBlack must move the king or block \u2014 but there is no block. The only legal responses are:\n- Move the king (but Ke7 or Ke6 are terrible \u2014 king in center, exposed).\n- Or do nothing \u2014 which means White can follow up with a devastating move.\n\n### Best Move for White:\nWhite should **capitalize on the exposed black king** immediately.\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move is:\n\n**6. Qxd8+!**\n\nThis is a **discovered check** \u2014 the queen moves from f6 to d8, delivering check via the rook on a1 (since the queen was blocking the a-file).\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- From f6 to d8: is that a legal queen move? Yes \u2014 it\u2019s a diagonal move (f6\u2013d8 is two squares diagonally backward).\n- Is it check? Yes \u2014 the rook on a1 now gives check along the d-file? No \u2014 wait, actually, the queen moving from f6 to d8 **uncovers a check from the rook on a1 along the a-file**, because the queen was on f6, not blocking the a-file.\n\nWait \u2014 correction: the queen on f6 is **not** blocking the a-file. The rook on a1 and queen on f6 are on different files. So Qxd8+ is just a direct check \u2014 not a discovered check.\n\nBut crucially:  \n- If Black plays **6...Kxd8**, then White has a massive material advantage \u2014 up a queen for a knight.\n- Black has no good way out \u2014 the king must capture, because the queen is on d8, so no other piece can block or capture.\n\nSo **6. Qxd8+** is a forced win of the black queen.\n\n### Why is this the best move?\n- It wins material decisively.\n- It ends the game quickly \u2014 Black is now down a queen with no compensation.\n- No risk \u2014 Black cannot avoid losing the queen.\n\n### Final Decision:\n```\nf6d8\n```",

It keeps the king safer, maintains better coordination, and allows for more flexible future play.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne8d8\n```",

This is a solid, principled choice.\n\n### 2. **e4e5** \u2014 Pawn push in center\n- Attacks d6 square, threatens to open lines near the black king.\n- After ...d7-d6 or ...f7-f6, White gains space and may follow up with d4 or Nc3.\n- However, it doesn\u2019t directly threaten anything yet \u2014 Black can respond with ...Nxe5, though that opens the center with king still in center \u2014 dangerous for Black.\n\nLet\u2019s test:  \nIf 1. e4e5 Nxe5?  \nThen 2. d2d4! \u2014 fork: the knight on e5 is attacked by both pawns now \u2014 Black must move it, and after ...Nc6 or ...Nf6, White gains time and central control.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is Nxe5 even safe for Black?\nAfter 1.e4e5 Nxe5 2.d2d4, the knight is attacked twice, defended once \u2014 so Black must move it or lose it. That\u2019s a tempo win.\n\nSo **e4e5** is aggressive, creates immediate tension, and exploits the central king.\n\n### 3. Other moves:\n- **f1c4 / f1b5 / f1a6**: Too early \u2014 Black\u2019s king is not yet in a mating net. These bishops need support.\n- **b1c3**: Natural, but less urgent than e4e5 or castling.\n- **d2d4**: Premature \u2014 e4 pawn would be hanging.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **e4e5** is the most forcing and aggressive move \u2014 it exploits the central king immediately.\n- It creates a threat (fork after d4) and forces Black to react.\n- Even if Black avoids the fork (e.g., ...d6 instead of ...Nxe5), White gains space and initiative.\n- If Black plays ...Nxe5, White wins a tempo with d4 \u2014 excellent.\n\nThis is not just a positional edge \u2014 it\u2019s a tactical opportunity.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n\n```\ne4e5\n```",

The position shows:\n- Black has a rook on a8, bishop on f8, king on d8, and knight on c6\n- White has a rook on a1, bishop on f1, king on e1, and knight on b1\n- The e5 square is occupied by a white pawn\n- The d8 square is occupied by a black king (though this seems unusual - typically kings don't stay on d8 after castling)\n- The move history shows some unusual moves, including a white queen moving to f6 and back to d8\n\nLooking at the legal moves, we have several options for the black knight on c6:\n- c6b8 (attacking the white rook on a1)\n- c6e7 (attacking the white bishop on f1)\n- c6e5 (attacking the white pawn on e5)\n- c6a5 (attacking the white pawn on a2)\n- c6d4 (attacking the white pawn on d2)\n- c6b4 (attacking the white pawn on b2)\n\nThe most promising move appears to be c6e5, attacking the white pawn on e5. This would:\n1. Win a pawn\n2. Open the e-file for the black rook\n3. Put pressure on white's position\n4. Maintain the initiative\n\nOther moves like c6b8 would attack the rook but might allow white to regroup, while c6e7 would attack the bishop but might not be as immediately decisive.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to attack the pawn with the knight:\n\n```\nc6e5\n```",

But Black's knight is on e5 now \u2014 so that must have been a swap: White knight captured something on e5, then Black recaptured with knight from c6 to e5.\n- c6e5 \u2192 Black knight from c6 to e5\n- g8f6 \u2192 Black knight from g8 to f6\n- Then: f3f6 \u2192 White queen or bishop? Wait \u2014 f3f6 is not a legal move for a knight from f3 \u2014 it must be a queen move: Qd1 to f3, then to f6?\n- f6d8 \u2192 Qf6xd8+ \u2014 that must be it: White queen captured on d8, Black king recaptured Kxd8\n- Then: e4e5 \u2192 White pawn from e4 to e5\n- c6e5 \u2192 Wait, c6e5 already happened earlier \u2014 this must be a duplicate or misrecorded.\n\nHold on \u2014 the move list is:\n`f3e5, c6e5, g8f6, f3f6, e8d8, f6d8, e4e5, c6e5`\n\nThis is confusing \u2014 but the final position is:\n- Black king on d8\n- White queen on d8 (but that can\u2019t be \u2014 because it\u2019s occupied by the king)\nWait \u2014 no: after `f6d8`, that must be Qf6xd8+, Black recaptures Kxd8. So queen is gone.\n\nSo the final position has:\n- White queen captured on d8, Black king recaptured\n- So now: White has no queen, Black has no queen, king on d8\n- White has pawns on a2\u2013d2, f2\u2013h2; Black similar\n- White knights: b1 still there, f3 gone (captured on e5 or moved)\nWait \u2014 f3e5: that must be Nf3xe5, then Black recaptured with c6e5 (Nc6xe5)\nThen White played Qd1-f3, then Qf3-f6, then Qf6xd8+, Kxd8\nThen e4e5 (pawn push), then c6e5 \u2014 but c6 is empty now? So maybe it's a different knight \u2014 perhaps from f6? But g8f6 already happened.\n\nThis is messy \u2014 but the **FEN is authoritative**.\n\nSo current position:\n```\nr1bk1b1r\npppp1ppp\n........\n....n...\n........\n........\nPPPP.PPP\nRNB.KB.R\n```\n\nWhite to move. Material is roughly equal: both sides missing queen, but otherwise full minor/major pieces.\n\nKey observations:\n- Black king is exposed on d8 \u2014 no castling, and center is open\n- White has a strong central pawn on e5, which just advanced (e4e5)\n- Black knight on e5 is now pinned? No \u2014 it's on e5, and White has no piece attacking it directly\n- White has a bishop on f1, knight on b1, king on e1, rooks on a1 and h1\n- Black has rooks on a8 and h8, bishops on c8 and f8, knight on e5\n\n**Threats:**\n- Black's knight on e5 is strong \u2014 it attacks f3 and d3\n- If White doesn\u2019t develop, Black can play ...Nc6 or ...Bc5, gaining initiative\n- White must develop quickly and exploit the exposed Black king\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- **b1c3**: Develop knight, supports d4, eyes e4 and d5\n- **f1c4**: Bishop to c4 \u2014 targets f7, pressures Black\u2019s king\n- **f1b5**: Bishop to b5 \u2014 pins knight on c6? But Black has no knight on c6 \u2014 it\u2019s on e5\n- **d2d4**: Immediate central expansion \u2014 but e5 pawn might be hanging?\n- **0-0 (h1g1)**: Kingside castling \u2014 safe king, connects rooks\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\n**1. h1g1 (0-0)** \u2014 Castling is tempting, but is it safe?\n- Black has no immediate threats \u2014 no queen, no immediate mate\n- After 0-0, White can follow up with Nc3, Bc4, etc.\n- But it doesn\u2019t immediately punish Black\u2019s exposed king\n\n**2. f1c4** \u2014 Bishop to c4: targets f7, a classic weakness\n- After Bc4, White threatens Qh5+ or just builds pressure\n- Black can\u2019t easily defend f7 \u2014 king on d8, no queen\n- Also, if Black plays ...Nc6, Bb5+ is possible\n\n**3. b1c3** \u2014 Develops knight, natural\n- But doesn\u2019t immediately threaten anything\n- Allows Black to consolidate\n\n**4. d2d4** \u2014 Central break\n- Challenges e5 knight\n- But after d4, Black can play ...Nc6 or ...exd4, and White\u2019s center might be overextended\n\n**Best move: f1c4**\n\nWhy?\n- Immediate pressure on f7 \u2014 a key weakness\n- Black has no good way to defend it \u2014 king on d8, no queen\n- If Black plays ...Nc6, then Bb5+ wins the knight or forces ...Bd7\n- If Black plays ...Be6, then White can follow up with Nc3, 0-0, and maintain pressure\n- This move exploits the exposed king and gains a tempo\n\n**Final decision:**\n```\nf1c4\n```",

The position shows:\n- Black has a bishop on f8 and a rook on h8\n- White has a bishop on c4 and a rook on h1\n- The kings are both in their starting positions (Black's king on e8, White's on e1)\n- The position appears to be from the opening, with some pieces already developed\n\nLooking at the legal moves, we need to consider:\n1. King safety (Black's king is still in the center)\n2. Piece development\n3. Potential threats from White\n\nThe most critical moves appear to be:\n- f8e7 (developing the bishop to a more active square)\n- d8e8 (moving the king to a safer square)\n- e5g6 (attacking White's bishop on c4)\n\nHowever, the most pressing concern is king safety.

White has a bishop on c4, Black has developed knight to g6.\n- Black king is on d8 \u2014 this is highly unusual. The king has moved from e8 to d8, likely due to a discovered attack or threat earlier in the game (from the move history: d1f3, g8f6, f3f6, e5c6, f6d8, e8d8). So White\u2019s queen captured on d8, and Black recaptured with the king \u2014 a critical mistake by Black!\n\n**Key observation:**\nBlack\u2019s king is on d8 \u2014 exposed in the center, no castling, and not yet connected rooks. This is a massive positional and tactical vulnerability.\n\nWhite has a bishop on c4, eyeing the weak dark squares around Black\u2019s king, especially f7 and d5.\n\nLet\u2019s look at candidate moves \u2014 especially tactical ones.\n\n### Candidate: 1. Bxf7!\nUCI: `c4f7`\n\nWhy this move?\n- Black\u2019s king is on d8 \u2014 no escape to e8 or e7.\n- After `c4f7`, Black must respond:\n  - If `Kxf7?` \u2014 then Qh5+ or Ng5+ wins the king immediately.\n  - But Black cannot capture the bishop because:\n    - `...Kxf7` leads to immediate mate:  \n      1...Kxf7 2. Ng5+ Kg8 3. Qh5 (threatening Qh7#) \u2014 and if ...h6, then Qg6# or Qxh6 with mate soon.\n  - If Black doesn\u2019t take, White has a free piece and devastating initiative:\n    - Threatens Qh5+, Ng5, etc.\n    - Black\u2019s king is stuck in the center, and White\u2019s pieces can swarm.\n\nThis is a **sacrificial blow** that exploits the king\u2019s central position.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n1. c4f7  \nIf 1...Kxf7 \u2014 then 2. Ng5+ Kg8 3. Qh5!  \nNow Black must play ...h6 or ...f6 to stop Qh7#.  \nBut after 3...h6, 4. Qg6#  \nAfter 3...f6, 4. Qh7+ Kf8 5. Qh8+ Ke7 6. Qg7+ Kd6 7. Nf7+ wins.\n\nEven if Black declines the bishop, White gains massive initiative \u2014 e.g., Qh5, Ng5, O-O, etc.\n\nNo other move gives such a clear and immediate advantage.\n\nOther moves like `c4e6`, `c4a6`, or developing with `b1c3` are too slow \u2014 this is a **now-or-never** moment.\n\n### \u2705 Best move: `c4f7`\n\n```\nc4f7\n```",

The position is quite complex with several pieces developed but the king still in the center. The key features:\n\n1. White has a bishop on f7 (from the move history) which is attacking the black king's position\n2. Black's king is on d8 (from the move history)\n3. Black has a knight on g6\n4. The black queen is on d8 (from the move history)\n5. There are several legal moves listed, mostly involving the knight on g6 and some bishop moves\n\nLooking at the legal moves, the most critical ones appear to be:\n- g6e7 (knight move to e7)\n- g6e5 (knight move to e5)\n- g6h4 (knight move to h4)\n- g6f4 (knight move to f4)\n\nThe other moves involve the bishop or queen, but the knight moves seem more urgent as they directly address the threat to the king.\n\nThe best move here is g6e7 because:\n1. It moves the knight to a safe square where it can still participate in the game\n2. It doesn't expose the king further\n3. It maintains pressure on white's position\n4. Other knight moves like g6e5 or g6h4 would leave the knight more exposed or less effective\n\nThe other moves like f8e7 (bishop move) would be passive and allow white to maintain the initiative. The queen moves would be even worse as they would expose the king further.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng6e7\n```",

That\u2019s a big material gain \u2014 Black\u2019s king is exposed and has lost the right to castle (king moved from e8 to d8 after Bxf7+).\n- Black\u2019s king is stuck in the center on d8, with limited mobility.\n- Black has a knight on e7 defending d8, but it's pinned by the bishop on f7!\n\n**Key observation:**\n- The Black king is on d8, and the knight on e7 blocks its escape to e8 or c8.\n- The White bishop on f7 delivers check, and the only legal responses from Black were to move the king to d8 (which happened), since Ke8 or Kf8 are not possible due to the pin and lack of flight squares.\n\nNow it\u2019s **White to move**, and we must find the strongest continuation.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate candidate moves:\n\n### 1. **Immediate checkmating idea:**\nAfter 1.Bxf7+ Kd8, can we finish Black off?\n\nLook at:\n- **Bxe7+** \u2014 tempting! But that would be a blunder:  \n  `f7e7` \u2192 Bxe7+?? Kxe7 \u2014 now the king escapes the pin, centralizes, and White has only a single pawn advantage. Not good \u2014 gives Black a way back into the game.\n\n### 2. **Better idea: exploit the pin and king position**\nWhat if we **remove the defender of d8** \u2014 the knight on e7 \u2014 without allowing it to recapture?\n\nHow?  \n**Check on d7!**\n\nBut how to get there?\n\nWait \u2014 look at this:\n\n### 3. **Brilliant candidate: Qd7# \u2014 but no queen on d-file yet.**\nWe need to set that up.\n\nActually, let\u2019s look at **Bxe7+ again**, but only if it leads to mate.\n\nIf:\n1. Bxe7+ Kxe7 \u2014 then what?\n\nNow king is on e7 \u2014 still in center, but no immediate mate.\n\nBut now White can play **Qd6+**, forcing the king to f8 or e8, then follow up with Re1+, etc. \u2014 messy, and Black might survive.\n\nNo \u2014 we want **immediate win**.\n\n### 4. **Is there a forced mate in 1 or 2?**\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n- **f7g8** \u2014 promotes to queen? No \u2014 it\u2019s a bishop, can\u2019t promote.\n- **f7e8** \u2014 Bxe8? Then Kxe8 \u2014 again, king escapes.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **f7g6**? Or **f7h5**? These just retreat the bishop \u2014 bad, giving Black time to regroup.\n\nNo \u2014 the key is that **Black has no good way to deal with the pin and lack of king safety**.\n\nHold on \u2014 what if we play:\n\n### \u2705 **b1c3** \u2014 developing a piece? Too slow.\n\n### \u2705 **e1g1** \u2014 castle? King safety? No \u2014 opponent is nearly mated!\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 Best move: Look again at the position.\n\nBlack king on d8, pinned knight on e7, bishop on f7.\n\nWhat happens after:\n\n**1. Be8+!!**\n\nThat is: **f7e8** in UCI.\n\nWhy is this brilliant?\n\n- If 1... Kxe8 \u2014 then **Qd6#**! Mate!\n- If 1... Nxe8 \u2014 then **Qd8#**! Also mate!\n\nBecause:\n- After Kxe8 \u2192 Qd6# (queen not on board yet \u2014 wait! Do we even have a queen on d-file?)\n\nHold on \u2014 we don\u2019t have a queen on d1 or d2. In fact, the queen hasn\u2019t moved yet \u2014 it\u2019s still on d1.\n\nSo after:\n1. Be8+!\n   - 1... Kxe8 \u2014 then **Qd6#** \u2014 yes, because Qd1-d6 delivers checkmate (king can\u2019t go back to d8, blocked by own pieces; e7 is attacked by queen; f8 is covered if needed).\n   - 1... Nxe8 \u2014 then **Qd8#** \u2014 because the queen goes to d8 and mates: king on d8 has no escape \u2014 c8 and e8 blocked, and no pieces can interpose.\n\nBUT \u2014 is Qd6# legal after Kxe8?\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- After 1.Be8+ Kxe8\n- 2.Qd6#\n\nQueen from d1 to d6 \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a legal move.\nKing on e8 \u2014 attacked by queen on d6.\nCan the king move?\n- d8 \u2014 occupied by nothing, but is it legal? No \u2014 because it came from d8 earlier \u2014 but now it's on e8.\n- From e8, king can go to d8, e7, f8, f7, d7 \u2014 but:\n  - d8 \u2014 not attacked?\n  - Wait \u2014 is d8 attacked? No \u2014 so king could go to d8?\n\nHold on \u2014 this is critical.\n\nAfter:\n1. Be8+ Kxe8  \n2. Qd6#\n\nIs this checkmate?\n\nKing on e8:\n- d8 \u2014 not attacked\n- d7 \u2014 not attacked\n- e7 \u2014 not attacked\n- f7 \u2014 occupied by nothing\n- f8 \u2014 not attacked\n\nSo king can escape to d8 or f8 \u2014 so **Qd6 is not mate**!\n\nOh no \u2014 our idea fails.\n\nSo 1.Be8+ Kxe8 2.Qd6+ \u2014 just a check, not mate. Then Black plays Kd8 or Kf8 \u2014 and lives.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\n### New idea: What if we play **Qd6+ first**?\n\nBut bishop is on f7 \u2014 if we move queen to d6, Black plays Nxf7 \u2014 and wins the bishop.\n\nSo that loses material.\n\n### Back to basics.\n\nWhat is the most forcing move?\n\nThe only piece that can deliver immediate pressure is the bishop.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n### \u2705 **f7g6** \u2014 no, retreats.\n\n### \u2705 **f7e6** \u2014 same.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **f7g8** \u2014 bishop to g8?\n\nThat\u2019s just retreating \u2014 no threat.\n\nHold on \u2014 what if we play:\n\n### \u2705 **e1e2** \u2014 king to e2? Prepares Kd3 or something \u2014 too slow.\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 Best move: **f7e8** \u2014 Be8+ \u2014 but as we saw, not immediately winning.\n\nWait \u2014 but what if Black has no legal move except to capture?\n\nLet\u2019s re-analyze:\n\nAfter 1.Be8+:\n- If 1... Nxe8 \u2014 then 2.Qd8# \u2014 YES! That is mate:\n  - King on d8\n  - Queen on d8 \u2014 but that would be capturing the knight \u2014 so it\u2019s Qxd8#\n  - Is that legal? Yes \u2014 and it\u2019s checkmate:\n    - King on d8 \u2014 now attacked by queen on d8 \u2014 wait, no \u2014 if queen captures on d8, it\u2019s not giving check \u2014 it\u2019s just capturing the knight.\n\nHold on \u2014 this is a critical mistake in reasoning.\n\nIf:\n1. Be8+  \n   - If 1... Nxe8 \u2014 then 2.Qxd8# \u2014 YES!  \n     Because:\n     - Queen from d1 to d8 \u2014 captures the knight and gives check.\n     - King on d8 \u2014 but it can\u2019t stay there \u2014 it\u2019s in check.\n     - Can it move? d7, c8, e8 \u2014 all either occupied or not attacked yet?\n     - d7 \u2014 empty \u2014 is it attacked? No.\n     - So king moves to d7 \u2014 and survives.\n\nWait \u2014 so 2.Qxd8+ \u2014 not mate \u2014 just a check.\n\nThen Black plays Kxd8 \u2014 and now White is up a piece, but no mate.\n\nSo again \u2014 not forced mate.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is **no forced mate** in 1 or 2 moves.\n\nSo we must choose the move that **maximizes pressure** and **prevents Black from untangling**.\n\nThe best move is:\n\n### \u2705 **Be8+!**\n\nWhy?\n- It forces a decision:\n  - If Black plays **Nxe8**, then White plays **Qd8+**, forcing the king to d7 \u2014 now king is still in center, and White has a massive advantage \u2014 likely winning.\n  - If Black plays **Kxe8**, then White plays **Qd6+**, forcing the king to d8 or f8 \u2014 again, king stuck in center, and White dominates.\n\nIn both cases, Black cannot castle, king remains exposed, and White has a huge positional and material edge.\n\nThis is the most forcing and strongest move \u2014 it maintains the initiative, exploits the pin, and",

Both sides have all pieces except:\n  - White has lost a bishop (likely the one on c4 captured on e8 \u2014 see move history)\n  - Black has lost a rook (Ra8 captured on d8 \u2014 f6d8, e8d8 implies rook sac on d8)\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s parse the **move history**:\n```\nf6d8   \u2192 Nf6xd8 (Black knight captures on d8 \u2014 but that would be illegal unless White\u2019s rook had moved?)\ne8d8   \u2192 Ke8xd8 (Black king recaptures \u2014 so Ra8 must have been on d8?)\ne4e5\nc6e5\nf1c4\ne5g6\nc4f7\ng6e7\nf7e8\nd8e8\n```\n\nThis is a sequence of captures:\n- ...Nf6xd8 (Black knight captures something on d8 \u2014 must be a rook)\n- Ke8xd8 (Black king recaptures)\n- Then later: Bf7xe8+, Kd8xe8\n\nSo White\u2019s light-squared bishop sacrificed itself on e8 to remove Black\u2019s king from the center.\n\nNow the current position:\n- White king is still on e1\n- Black king is on e8\n- White has not castled\n- Black has no castling rights (king moved twice)\n\n**Current position (after 10...Ke8):**\n\n```\nr1b1kb1r/ppppn1pp/8/8/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 11\n```\n\nWhite has:\n- King on e1\n- Rooks on a1 and h1\n- Knight on b1\n- Pawns mostly on 2nd rank\n- Bishop gone (sacrificed)\n- Queen not yet developed\n\nBlack has:\n- King on e8 (moved twice \u2014 no castling)\n- Knights: one on e7 (just moved there)\n- Bishops on c8 and f8\n- Rooks on a8 and h8\n- Pawns on 2nd rank except d7, c7, etc. \u2014 all still intact\n\n**Key observations:**\n- White has a huge development advantage: Black has only developed one knight (to e7), while White has a knight ready to develop and can castle.\n- Black\u2019s king is stuck in the center \u2014 a major target.\n- White should **castle immediately** to get the king safe and connect rooks \u2014 this is the most urgent move.\n- Among legal moves, `e1g1` (kingside castling) is available \u2014 that\u2019s 0-0.\n\nWhy not queenside castling (`e1c1`)? Not in the legal moves list \u2014 so only kingside castling is available (makes sense \u2014 rook on a1 hasn\u2019t moved, but maybe king has? No \u2014 king hasn\u2019t moved \u2014 but queenside castling not listed as legal, so perhaps it\u2019s blocked or disallowed for some reason \u2014 but in FEN, \"KQ\" is present, so both should be legal. However, the legal moves list only includes `e1g1`, not `e1c1`. So we must trust the legal move list \u2014 only kingside castling is currently legal. Maybe the queen or bishop is blocking \u2014 but no, the board shows all pieces on original squares except the missing bishop.\n\nWait \u2014 the legal moves list includes:\n- `e1g1` \u2705\n- `e1f1` (king to f1 \u2014 not castling)\n- `e1d1` (king to d1)\n- `h1g1` (rook move)\n- etc.\n\nSo `e1g1` is explicitly listed \u2014 that\u2019s kingside castling.\n\n**Best move: Castle kingside immediately.**\n\nWhy?\n- King safety \u2014 Black may soon develop and attack the center.\n- Connects rooks \u2014 White\u2019s rooks are passive.\n- Prepares for rapid development: after castling, play Nb1-c3, then d2-d4 or similar.\n- Black\u2019s king is exposed \u2014 White must exploit this.\n\nNo better move exists right now. Developing the knight (`b1c3`) is tempting, but castling is more urgent \u2014 it\u2019s a free tempo and improves king safety + rook activity.\n\n**Final decision:**\n```\ne1g1\n```",

White has traded a bishop for a knight (Bxf7+ \u2192 Nxe7, then Bxe8 \u2192 Qxe8). So it's a fair exchange.\n- Both sides have all remaining pieces except those two minor pieces.\n\n**Positional Assessment:**\n- White king is safe on g1, with rook on f1 and castled structure intact.\n- Black king is stuck in the center on d8 \u2014 a huge liability.\n- Black\u2019s development is lagging: queen just returned to d8, knight on e7 is passive, both bishops are on bad diagonals (Bc8 still blocked by pawns, Bf8 on f8 but no open lines).\n- White has a lead in development: king castled, rook on f1 active, knight on b1 ready to jump, all pawns in starting formation except e4.\n\n**Threats:**\n- Black\u2019s king on d8 is exposed. White should look to exploit this immediately.\n- Immediate tactical idea: Can we open lines toward the king? Or accelerate development to attack?\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\nLet\u2019s evaluate the legal moves:\n\n1. **0-0-0 (king-side rook to e1 or d1)** \u2014 Not possible; king already moved (castled), so no queenside castling.\n   - So moves like `f1e1` or `f1d1` are just rook repositioning \u2014 not bad, but not urgent.\n\n2. **Develop the knight: `b1c3` or `b1a3`**\n   - `b1c3` is natural: develops with tempo, eyes d5 and e4, supports central control.\n   - `b1a3` is awkward \u2014 blocks a2 pawn, no immediate purpose.\n\n3. **Pawn moves: d4, c4, f4, etc.**\n   - `d2d4` \u2014 immediately strikes in the center, opens lines toward Black\u2019s king.\n   - This is very tempting: after d4, if ...c5? then d5! could trap the knight on e7.\n   - Also, d4 opens the queen\u2019s diagonal (if queen comes to d3 later) and supports e5 if needed.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nBlack\u2019s king on d8 is the biggest weakness in the position. White must act quickly before Black manages to get the king to safety (e.g., ...Kd7\u2013Ke8 or ...0-0-0).\n\nThe best plan is to:\n- Develop with tempo\n- Open lines toward the enemy king\n- Exploit the undeveloped state of Black\u2019s pieces\n\n**Best Move: `d2d4`**\n\nWhy?\n- Immediate central expansion\n- Threatens to open the position while Black\u2019s king is still in the center\n- If Black plays ...c5 (to challenge), then d5! traps the knight on e7 \u2014 a devastating blow\n- Prepares for rapid development: after d4, Nc3, then maybe Be3 or Qd2, all with attacking chances\n\nThis is a classic case of \u201cwhen the king is in the center, open the position.\u201d\n\nNo other move gives White such a strong initiative. Moves like `b1c3` are good but less urgent \u2014 d4 strikes now.\n\n```\nd2d4\n```",

The position shows:\n- Black has a rook on a8, bishop on f8, king on d8, knight on e7, and pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, g7, h7\n- White has a rook on a1, bishop on c1, knight on b1, king on g1, and pawns on a2, b2, c2, d4, f2, g2, h2\n- The position appears to be a Sicilian Defense or similar opening where Black has developed pieces but White has more space\n\nLooking at the legal moves, we need to choose the best option for Black. The key factors to consider:\n1. Piece development and coordination\n2. King safety\n3. Control of key squares\n4. Potential threats\n\nThe most promising moves appear to be:\n- e7g8 (developing the knight to a more active square)\n- e7g6 (centralizing the knight)\n- d7d6 (solidifying the center)\n- c7c6 (preparing for queenside expansion)\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to develop the knight to g8, which:\n1. Activates the knight towards the center\n2. Prepares for potential kingside operations\n3. Doesn't block any other pieces\n4. Maintains flexibility for future plans\n\nThe move e7g8 (knight from e7 to g8) is the most strategic choice here, improving Black's piece coordination and preparing for future development.\n\n```\ne7g8\n```",

Pushing it to d5 could open lines toward the black king.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. **d4d5** \u2014 Immediate central expansion, opens lines toward black king, restricts knight on g8, and creates threats like Nc3 with pressure on e4/d5.\n2. **c1g5** or **c1f4** \u2014 Develop the bishop to active squares targeting the black king.\n3. **b1c3** \u2014 Natural development, supports d4, prepares to bring queen or rook into attack.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate **d4d5** most critically:\n\nAfter **d4d5**, Black must respond. Their options are limited:\n- ...c7c6? \u2014 weakens the king\u2019s position further, opens c-file for White\u2019s rook.\n- ...Nf6? \u2014 but knight is on g8, so not possible yet.\n- ...c7c5? \u2014 hangs a pawn after dxc6 en passant? No \u2014 not possible because no black pawn on d7.\n- Most likely: ...c7c6 to defend, but then White plays **Nb1\u2013c3**, then **Bc1\u2013g5** or **Bf4**, and the attack explodes.\n\nThis is a classic \"pawn storm\" against an uncastled king. White\u2019s lead in development and Black\u2019s king stuck in the center make this a decisive opportunity.\n\n**Why not develop first?**\nBecause Black might survive if given time \u2014 e.g., ...c6, ...Be6, ...Kc8, and the king escapes. We must strike now.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to **strike in the center immediately** and exploit the exposed king.\n\n```\nd4d5\n```",

The position shows:\n- Black has a rook on a8, bishop on c8, knight on g8, king on d8, and pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7\n- White has a rook on a1, bishop on c1, knight on b1, king on g1, and pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2\n- The position appears to be an open game with some pieces exchanged\n\nLooking at the legal moves, we need to choose the best one for Black. The key factors to consider:\n1. King safety: Black's king is on d8, which is somewhat exposed\n2. Piece activity: Black's pieces are somewhat passive\n3. Pawn structure: Black has a solid pawn structure but needs to activate pieces\n\nThe best move appears to be developing the knight to f6 (g8f6). This:\n- Develops a piece to a more active square\n- Controls important central squares\n- Prepares for potential kingside operations\n- Doesn't weaken Black's position\n\nOther moves like g8e7 or g8h6 would be less effective as they don't contribute as much to piece development or central control.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng8f6\n```",

Nf6, and now it's White's 14th move)\n- The center is open with a white pawn on d5\n- Black\u2019s king is exposed in the center, and both sides have developed minimally\n- White has a significant lead in development: rook on f1, knight on b1, bishop on c1 \u2014 all ready to join the attack\n- Black\u2019s pieces are mostly undeveloped or misplaced (queen gone, king stuck, knights on f6 and g8)\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Black\u2019s king is on d8 \u2014 extremely vulnerable\n- White has a central pawn on d5, which can become a dangerous passer if pushed\n- Black has no pieces defending the center or king \u2014 only pawns on c7 and d7\n- The black king is trapped in the center \u2014 this is a golden opportunity for a quick attack\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\nWe must look for forcing moves \u2014 checks, threats, or immediate tactical shots.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most aggressive options:\n\n### 1. **d5d6** \u2014 Pawn push to d6\n- This threatens to open the d-file and attack the black king directly\n- If Black plays ...c7xd6, then Rd1+ wins the king \u2014 mate in a few moves\n- Let\u2019s test it:\n  - 14. d6 cxd6\n    - 15. Rd1+ Kc7\n      - 16. Bf4+ Kb6 (only move)\n      - 17. Na3! or Nb4+ \u2014 huge initiative, and Black is lost\n- Even if Black doesn\u2019t take, say 14... a6, then 15. Bg5! or Bf4, increasing pressure\n- This is a **killing blow** \u2014 it exploits the king\u2019s position immediately\n\n### Other moves:\n- **b1c3 / b1d2**: Too slow \u2014 developing when we can finish the game\n- **c1g5 / c1f4**: Tempting, but d6 is more forcing\n- **f1e1 / f1d1**: Passive \u2014 we must attack now\n- **d5d6** is the only move that creates an immediate, unavoidable threat\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhite must play **d5d6** \u2014 it\u2019s a decisive tactical shot that exploits the exposed black king. Any response leads to a forced win.\n\n```\nd5d6\n```",

The position shows:\n- Black has a rook on a8, bishop on f8, king on d8, knight on f6, and pawns on a7, b7, d6, g7, h7\n- White has a rook on a1, bishop on d1, knight on b1, king on g1, and pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2\n- The position appears to be a complex middlegame with both sides having developed pieces\n\nLooking at the legal moves, we need to choose the best one for Black. The key factors to consider:\n1. King safety: Black's king is on d8, which is somewhat exposed\n2. Piece activity: Black's pieces are well-placed but need to coordinate better\n3. Pawn structure: Black has a passed pawn on d6 which could be valuable\n\nThe most promising moves appear to be:\n- f6g8 (moving the knight to a more active square)\n- f6e8 (centralizing the knight)\n- f6h5 (attacking the white pawn on g2)\n- f6d5 (centralizing the knight and attacking the white bishop on d1)\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is f6d5 because:\n1. It centralizes the knight to a strong square\n2. It attacks the white bishop on d1\n3. It prepares for potential kingside expansion\n4. It maintains pressure on White's position\n\nThe move f6d5 also has good follow-up possibilities, such as potentially moving the knight to e3 or f4 later in the game.\n\n```\nf6d5\n```",

Wait \u2014 no, the move history shows only 5 moves:  \n  e1g1 (O-O), e8d8, d2d4, e7g8, d4d5, g8f6, d5d6, c7d6, f1d1, f6d5 \u2014 so the knight on b1 hasn't moved yet.\n\nWait \u2014 the board shows:\n- White: King g1, Rook a1, Knight b1, Bishop c1, Rook d1, pawns on a2,b2,c2,f2,g2,h2 \u2014 all present.\n- Black: King d8, Rook a8, Bishop f8, Knight d5, pawns on a7,b7,d6 \u2014 missing c7 pawn (captured), and g7/h7 still there.\n\nSo the position is:\n\n```\n8 | r . k . b . . r\n7 | p p . p . . p p\n6 | . . . p . . . .\n5 | . . . n . . . .\n4 | . . . . . . . .\n3 | . . . . . . . .\n2 | P P P . . P P P\n1 | R N B R . . K .\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nWhite has a significant lead in development:\n- Both rooks are active (a1 and d1)\n- King is safe\n- Black king is stuck in the center on d8 \u2014 a huge vulnerability\n- Black knight on d5 is currently undefended \u2014 it's on a central square but hanging!\n\n**Key observation**:  \nThe knight on d5 is **undefended**.  \nWhite can capture it immediately with **Rd1xd5**, winning a piece.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- Is d5 attacked by anything? No \u2014 Black has no pieces attacking d5.\n- After Rd1xd5, Black must recapture with ...c7xd5 (only legal recapture \u2014 the king can't take, and no other piece can).\n- Then White has a free tempo to continue attacking the exposed black king.\n\nAfter:\n1. Rxd5 cxd5  \nNow Black has doubled, isolated pawns on d5 and d6, and the king is still on d8 \u2014 now even more exposed because the center is open.\n\nWhite can follow up with:\n- Nc3, developing with tempo (attacking d5 or preparing to dominate the center)\n- Or even Bg5 or Bf4, increasing pressure on the king.\n\nThis is a clear winning advantage \u2014 **winning a piece for free**.\n\nNo other move comes close in evaluation:\n- Moving the king (g1h1 or g1f1) wastes time\n- Other rook moves (d1d4, d1d3, etc.) don\u2019t exploit the hanging piece\n- Developing the knight (b1c3) is good, but not as good as winning material first\n\n**Best move: Capture the knight on d5**\n\n```\nd1d5\n```",

The black king is on e8, queen-side rook on a8, and king-side rook on h8.\n\nWhite has a knight on b1, bishop on c1, and king on g1 \u2014 all undeveloped or minimally active.\n\n### Key Tactical Opportunity:\n- **Rook on d5** is attacking d6, which is defended only by the king \u2014 but the king can't move there.\n- If we play **d5xd6**, Black must recapture with the king: **Kxd6**.\n- Then we have a devastating follow-up: **Ra1-d1+**, forking the king and whatever is on d8 (currently a black rook on a8 and bishop on e7 \u2014 so d8 is empty? Wait \u2014 FEN: `r1bk3r` \u2192 so on d8 is a black king, c8 is a black bishop, b8 is a black knight? No \u2014 `r1b` means: a8=R, b8=empty, c8=B, d8=K \u2014 yes, king on d8.\n\nSo after:\n1. **d5xd6+ Kxd6**\n2. **Rd1+** \u2014 check! The rook on d1 (currently on a1) can now deliver check along the d-file.\n\nBut wait \u2014 currently, the rook on a1 is blocked by the knight on b1. So we can\u2019t play Rd1 immediately after d5xd6 unless we move the knight.\n\nHold on \u2014 is d1 really accessible? The rook on a1 needs a clear path to d1. Currently, the knight is on b1, so the rook can\u2019t get to d1 unless the knight moves.\n\nSo maybe we need to prepare that.\n\n### Candidate Move: **d5xd6+**\nLet\u2019s test it:\n- 1. d5xd6+ Kxd6\n- Now Black\u2019s king is on d6 \u2014 exposed in the center.\n- Can we exploit it?\n\nWhite\u2019s pieces:\n- Rook on a1 \u2014 can go to d1 if knight moves.\n- Knight on b1 \u2014 can go to c3 or d2.\n- Bishop on c1 \u2014 can develop to f4 or e3.\n- King on g1 \u2014 safe for now.\n\nAfter 1...Kxd6, the king is on d6 \u2014 now vulnerable to checks from rook or queen.\n\nIf we play **Nb1-c3**, then **Ra1-d1+** is possible next move.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. d5xd6+ Kxd6\n2. Nc3 \u2014 developing with tempo\n3. Rd1+ \u2014 winning the rook on h8 or forcing king to e6, then more pressure.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after 1...Kxd6, is there a better immediate threat than waiting for Nc3?\n\nWhat about **Ra1-d1+** immediately? Can\u2019t \u2014 blocked by knight on b1.\n\nSo we must move the knight first \u2014 or play something else.\n\nAlternative idea: **Ra1-d1** first \u2014 but that\u2019s not a legal move right now (knight on b1 blocks). So we must move the knight before we can use the a1 rook on the d-file.\n\nSo perhaps the best move is:\n\n### \u2705 **d5xd6+**\n\nForcing the king to d6, then we follow up with:\n- **Nb1-c3** (developing with tempo \u2014 attacking the king on d6)\n- Then **Ra1-d1+** \u2014 winning material or delivering mate.\n\nLet\u2019s verify legality:\n- d5xd6 is in the legal moves list: \u2705 `d5d6`\n\nAlso, after Kxd6, the king is on d6 \u2014 now the knight on b1 can go to c3, attacking the king directly \u2014 that\u2019s a discovered check from the rook on d6? No \u2014 rook is on d6, same file as king.\n\nWait \u2014 after d5xd6+, rook is now on d6, king on d6 \u2014 no, that\u2019s impossible. You can\u2019t capture and leave both pieces on same square.\n\nClarify:\n- d5xd6 means rook on d5 captures on d6 \u2014 so rook moves to d6, pawn on d6 is removed.\n- So after d5xd6+, the rook is on d6, and the black king must capture it: **Kxd6** \u2014 king moves to d6.\n\nNow the rook is gone \u2014 so the d-file is open again.\n\nNow, the a1 rook can move to d1 \u2014 but still blocked by knight on b1.\n\nSo after 1. d5xd6+ Kxd6, we play 2. Nb1-c3 \u2014 now the king on d6 is attacked by the knight \u2014 that\u2019s a check!\n\nSo: 2. Nc3+ \u2014 king must move: Kd6-e6 or Kd6-e5 or Kd6-c6.\n\nThen 3. Ra1-d1 \u2014 now the rook enters the d-file with check, and the king has no good squares.\n\nThis is a powerful sequence.\n\n### Why not other moves?\n- Other rook moves like d5h5, d5g5 \u2014 too slow, no immediate threat.\n- Developing bishop or knight without exploiting the pin and exposed king is passive.\n- This is a tactical moment \u2014 we must strike now.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is **d5xd6+** \u2014 it forces the king to the center, and opens the door for a devastating follow-up with Nc3+ and Rd1.\n\n```\nd5d6\n```",

The position is quite open, with both sides having developed their pieces. Black has a rook on the open h-file, and White has a rook on the open d-file.\n\n### Current Position Summary:\n\n**Black:**\n- King on c8\n- Rooks on a8 and h8\n- Bishop on e7\n- Pawns on a7, b7, d6, e7, g7, h7\n\n**White:**\n- King on g1\n- Rook on d6\n- Bishop on c1\n- Knight on b1\n- Pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- Black has a **slight lead in development**, especially with the bishop on e7 and rook on h8 ready to act.\n- White has a **strong central pawn on d6**, but it's currently under pressure from the Black rook on d8.\n- Black's king is still in the center, but so is White's.\n- Black has a **potential plan** of doubling rooks on the d-file or activating the queen-side rook.\n- Black must be careful not to allow White to consolidate and gain control of the center.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n1. **...Rhd8** \u2013 Doubling rooks on the d-file, putting pressure on White's advanced pawn.\n2. **...Bf6** \u2013 Developing the bishop, supporting the d6 pawn, and preparing to castle queenside.\n3. **...Kc7** \u2013 Centralizing the king, but risky with no pawn cover.\n4. **...a6** \u2013 Preparing b5, possibly to challenge the center.\n5. **...g6** \u2013 Preparing to fianchetto the bishop or support a kingside attack.\n\n### Best Move:\n\nThe most logical and active move is **...Rhd8**, doubling rooks on the d-file. This puts immediate pressure on White's advanced pawn on d6 and forces White to respond. It also activates the rook on d8, which is currently passive.\n\nThis move fits well with Black's plan of pressuring the center and improving piece activity.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nd8d6\n```",

White has a centralized knight on b1 that can jump into the game. Black\u2019s king is exposed in the center \u2014 this is critical.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Black\u2019s king is on d8, with no pawn shield, and the only defender near is the bishop on d6.\n- White has a discovered attack potential: if the bishop on c1 moves, the rook on a1 can exert pressure along the a-file \u2014 but more importantly, **the knight on b1 can jump to c3**, attacking the black king directly!\n- After **Nc3+**, the black king must move to e8 or c8. Then White can follow up with **Ra8+**, forking the king and rook \u2014 likely winning material or delivering mate.\n\nLet\u2019s test this:\n\n**Candidate move: b1c3**\n\nAfter `b1c3+`:\n- Black king must go to c8 or e8.\n  - If `Kc8`, then `Ra8+` wins the rook on a8 \u2014 because after `Kd7`, the rook on a8 is undefended.\n  - If `Ke8`, then `Ra8+` again forces `Kd7`, and now the rook on a8 is hanging.\n\nIn both cases, White wins the rook on a8 with a decisive material advantage (rook for knight), and the position is winning.\n\n**Why not other moves?**\n- Castling (`g1h1` or `g1f1`) wastes time \u2014 the king is safe enough, and we have a forced win.\n- Moving the bishop (`c1h6`, etc.) might be tempting but doesn\u2019t exploit the immediate tactical opportunity.\n- Pawn moves like `c2c3` or `f2f3` are slow \u2014 we have a check that wins material now.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a classic case of a **knight fork + rook lift** tactic.

The position shows:\n- Black has a rook on a8, bishop on d6, king on c8, and pawns on a7, b7, d7, h7, g7\n- White has a knight on c3, bishop on c1, king on g1, and pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2\n- The black bishop on d6 is under attack from the white knight on c3\n- The black king is somewhat exposed on c8\n- The white pieces are somewhat passive but have potential to activate\n\nLooking at the legal moves, we need to find the best way to defend or counterattack. The most critical issue is the bishop on d6 being attacked by the knight on c3.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. The bishop on d6 is valuable and needs to be defended or moved\n2. The black king is somewhat exposed and needs protection\n3. We should look for moves that either defend the bishop or create counterplay\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- h8g8, h8f8, h8e8: These are rook moves that don't address the immediate threat\n- d8e8, d8e7, d8c7: These are king moves that don't help with the bishop threat\n- a8b8: This is a rook move that doesn't address the immediate issue\n- d6f8, d6b8, d6e7, d6c7, d6e5, d6c5, d6f4, d6b4, d6g3, d6a3, d6h2: These are bishop moves that either defend or move the bishop\n- h7h6, g7g6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, b7b5, a7a5: These are pawn moves that don't address the immediate threat\n\nThe best options are the bishop moves that either defend or move the bishop. Among these:\n- d6e7: This moves the bishop to e7, where it's still active and defends the king\n- d6c7: This moves the bishop to c7, where it's still active and defends the king\n- d6e5: This moves the bishop to e5, where it's more active but leaves the king less defended\n\nThe most prudent move is d6e7, which:\n1. Moves the bishop to a safe square\n2. Keeps the bishop active\n3. Defends the king\n4. Maintains pressure on white's position\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd6e7\n```",

This is a huge liability.\n- White\u2019s knight on c3 can jump to several squares, but one stands out: **c3 \u2192 d5**.\n- Why d5? Because:\n  - It attacks c7 (pinned by the open d-file), and more importantly:\n  - It **forks** the black king on d8 and black rook on a8.\n  - After **c3d5**, Black must move the king (can\u2019t capture the knight \u2014 it\u2019s protected by the rook on d-file? Wait \u2014 no rook on d-file now... but the knight is on c3, and after moving to d5, is it protected?\n\nHold on \u2014 is the knight on c3 protected?\n- No piece directly protects it now. So if we play **c3d5**, and Black plays **Kd8xd5**, then White can recapture with **Rd1xd5** \u2014 but wait, there is no rook on d1 anymore!\n\nLooking at the move history:\n- d5d6, c7d6, f1d1, f6d5, d1d5, f8e7, d5d6, e7d6, b1c3, d6e7\n\nSo the rook was on d1, captured on d5, then d5-d6, then Black recaptured with ...e7xd6. So the rook is gone.\n\nSo the knight on c3 is **not protected**. If we play **c3d5**, and Black plays **Kxd5**, we have no recapture \u2014 we lose the knight for free.\n\nSo **c3d5** is a blunder \u2014 it loses material.\n\nLet\u2019s re-evaluate.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n\n1. **c3b5** \u2014 threatens the a7 pawn, but doesn\u2019t pressure the king.\n2. **c3e4** \u2014 central, but no immediate threat.\n3. **c3a4** \u2014 similar, not urgent.\n4. **c1g5 / c1f4 / c1e3** \u2014 developing the bishop, but king is still exposed.\n5. **a1b1** \u2014 preparing queenside expansion, not urgent.\n6. **g1h1** \u2014 king safety, but Black has no immediate threat on g2.\n7. **f2f3 / g2g3 / h2h3** \u2014 slow.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **tactical shot**?\n\nLook again: Black\u2019s king is on d8, bishop on e7, rook on a8 and h8.\n\nWhite\u2019s pieces: knight on c3, bishop on c1, king on g1, rook on a1.\n\nWhat if we play:\n\n**c1h6!** \u2014 UCI: `c1h6`\n\nWhy?\n- Targets h7, which is only defended by the king.\n- If Black plays ...g7-g6, we can follow up with **Nd5**, forking king and rook \u2014 and now the knight is protected by the bishop on h6!\n- Even better: if Black ignores it, we can play **Nd5** next, and if Black takes on d5, king must recapture \u2014 then **Bxh7** wins the rook on h8 or gives massive advantage.\n\nBut is **c1h6** safe?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n- Can Black capture on h6? Only if ...g7-h6, but that would be a terrible weakening \u2014 and they\u2019d have to do it immediately.\n- Black has no pieces attacking c1 or h6.\n\nSo **c1h6** is a strong, aggressive move that:\n- Prepares a devastating **Nd5** threat\n- Exploits the king on d8\n- Forces Black to weaken with ...g6 or lose material\n\nThis is much better than passive moves.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is **c1h6**, preparing a knight fork and exploiting the exposed king.\n\n```\nc1h6\n```",

White has a bishop on h6, Black has a dark-squared bishop on e7 and a rook on g8 and a8. Black's king is exposed in the center (on d8 \u2014 unusual!), and White has a developed knight on c3.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Black king is on d8** \u2014 extremely dangerous! It hasn't castled and is stuck in the center.\n- **White's bishop on h6** is already attacking h7, but more importantly, it's **pinned against the Black king** along the a1-h8 diagonal \u2014 but wait: is it really pinned?\n  - The bishop on h6 is **not** pinned because it's not between the king and a more valuable piece \u2014 it's just sitting on a square that attacks the king\u2019s diagonal. In fact, it's **loose** \u2014 it can be captured by ...g7-g6 or ...g7xh6, but that would open the g-file and expose the king further.\n- However, **White has a devastating tactical shot here.**\n\n### Candidate Move: **h6g7**  \nThis captures the pawn on g7, but more importantly:\n- If Black recaptures with **...Rxg7**, then White plays **Nd5!**, forking king and rook \u2014 Black must move the king, and White wins the rook on g7.\n- If Black doesn\u2019t recapture, then White just wins a pawn with a devastating initiative \u2014 the king is still stuck in the center, and now the g-file is open.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n\n1. **h6g7**  \n   - If 1...Rxg7, then 2. Nd5!  \n     - Now, Black\u2019s king must move: 2...Kd7 or Kc8 or Ke8 \u2014 all allow 3. Nxe7, winning the bishop and gaining massive material and positional dominance.\n     - After 2...Kd7 3. Nxe7 Kxe7, White has a free rook on a1, open files, and Black\u2019s king is still in danger.\n   - If 1...Kd7, then White has a free piece (bishop on g7) and can continue with development or attack.\n\nThis is a **winning sacrifice** \u2014 not even a true sacrifice, because if Black takes, White wins material. If Black doesn\u2019t take, White gains a free pawn and opens the g-file with tempo.\n\n### Why not other moves?\n- Moves like **c3d5**, **c3e4**, etc., are tempting but allow Black time to improve (e.g., ...Kd7, ...Rg8-g6, ...Be7-f6).\n- **a1f1**, **a1e1** \u2014 too slow. The king is begging to be attacked.\n- **h2h3**, **g2g3** \u2014 passive. No urgency.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis is a critical moment. Black\u2019s king is in the center, and White must strike **now**.  \n**h6g7** is the only move that forces immediate consequences \u2014 either win material or gain a huge positional advantage.\n\n```\nh6g7\n```",

The position shows:\n- Black has a rook on a8, bishop on e7, king on d8, and pawns on a7, b7, d7, h7\n- White has a rook on a1, bishop on g7, knight on c3, and pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2\n- The kings are on g1 (White) and d8 (Black)\n\nFrom the move history, we can see this has been a complex middlegame with exchanges happening. The current position appears to be a sharp tactical situation.\n\nLooking at the legal moves, we need to find the best continuation. The most critical moves appear to be:\n1. g8h8 (rook move)\n2. g8f8 (rook move)\n3. g8e8 (rook move)\n4. g8g7 (rook capture)\n5. d8e8 (king move)\n6. d8c7 (king move)\n7. a8b8 (rook move)\n8. e7f8 (bishop move)\n9. e7f6 (bishop move)\n10. e7d6 (bishop move)\n11. e7g5 (bishop move)\n12. e7c5 (bishop move)\n13. e7h4 (bishop move)\n14. e7b4 (bishop move)\n15. e7a3 (bishop move)\n16. h7h6 (pawn move)\n17. d7d6 (pawn move)\n18. b7b6 (pawn move)\n19. a7a6 (pawn move)\n20. h7h5 (pawn move)\n21. d7d5 (pawn move)\n22. b7b5 (pawn move)\n23. a7a5 (pawn move)\n\nThe most critical moves are the rook moves along the g-file (g8h8, g8f8, g8e8) and the bishop moves (e7f8, e7f6, etc.). The king moves (d8e8, d8c7) are also possibilities.\n\nGiven the position, the most forcing move appears to be g8g7, capturing the white bishop on g7. This would be a significant material gain (bishop for rook) and likely lead to a winning position.\n\nHowever, we must verify if this is indeed the best move. Let's consider alternatives:\n- g8h8 or g8f8 would be passive rook moves\n- e7f8 would be a bishop move that doesn't immediately gain material\n- d8e8 or d8c7 would be king moves that don't address the immediate tactical situation\n\nThe capture g8g7 is the most forcing and materialistic move, and given that we're playing as Black with the advantage, we should press this.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng8g7\n```",

That seems inconsistent with the move history.\n\nLet\u2019s reconcile the move history with the FEN:\n\n**Move history (UCI):**\n1. d1d5 \u2014 Qd1xd5\n2. f8e7 \u2014 Bf8-e7\n3. d5d6 \u2014 Qd5xd6\n4. e7d6 \u2014 Be7xd6\n5. b1c3 \u2014 Nb1-c3\n6. d6e7 \u2014 Bxd6-e7\n7. c1h6 \u2014 Bc1-h6\n8. h8g8 \u2014 Rh8-g8\n9. h6g7 \u2014 Bh6xg7\n10. g8g7 \u2014 Rg8xg7\n\nSo after 10...Rg7, the board should have:\n- White: King on g1, Rook on a1, Knight on c3, pawns intact\n- Black: King on g7, Rook on g7, Bishop on e7, etc.\n\nBut the FEN shows:\n- Black king on **d8**, not g7 \u2014 that\u2019s a contradiction.\n\nThis means the FEN must be the current position **after** 10...Rg7, but the king has moved from g7 to d8 \u2014 which is impossible unless it's a different position.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the FEN is correct and the move history is incomplete or misaligned. Let's trust the FEN as the current position.\n\n**Current FEN: `r1bk4/pp1pb1rp/8/8/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - - 0 21`**\n\nSo:\n- White king on g1\n- Black king on d8 \u2014 that\u2019s unusual. Why is the king on d8?\n- Black rook on g7\n- Black bishop on e7\n- White knight on c3\n- White rook on a1\n- Black rook on a8\n- Black bishop on c8? No \u2014 it\u2019s on e7.\n\nSo the black king must have moved from g7 to d8 \u2014 but that would require 3 moves: g7-f7-e8-d8 or similar. So the move history must be incomplete.\n\nGiven that, we must accept the FEN as the true current position.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Black king is on d8 \u2014 very unusual, likely due to castling being impossible and king fleeing danger.\n- Black has no immediate threats.\n- White has a knight on c3, which is active.\n- Black\u2019s king is centralized but not in immediate check.\n- Black\u2019s rook on g7 is passive.\n- White has a full set of pawns, Black too.\n- No immediate tactics like discovered checks or forks.\n\nNow, evaluate candidate moves:\n\n**1. c3d5** \u2014 Knight to d5. This attacks the black bishop on e7 and centralizes the knight. Strong candidate.\n- If ...Bxd5, then white recaptures with a pawn or piece \u2014 but no pawn on e4 or d4. So if Bxd5, white must recapture with something \u2014 but only knight or rook. Not ideal.\n- But if Black doesn\u2019t take, Nd5 pressures e7 and c7.\n\n**2. c3b5** \u2014 Knight to b5. Threatens a7, attacks c7 square. Black must respond \u2014 possibly ...a6 or ...Kc8.\n- This is aggressive and targets the queenside.\n\n**3. c3e4** \u2014 Knight to e4. Central, but e4 is not a strong outpost yet \u2014 no immediate threat.\n\n**4. a1f1** \u2014 Rook to f1. Prepares kingside activity, but no immediate threat.\n\n**5. g1h1** \u2014 King to h1. Safe, but passive.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on **c3d5** and **c3b5** \u2014 both are strong.\n\nAfter **c3d5**:\n- If ...Bxd5, then white must recapture \u2014 only with a piece. No pawn can recapture. So white loses the knight for a bishop \u2014 even material, but knight was better placed.\n- So Black might not take \u2014 instead play ...Kc8 or ...a6.\n\nAfter **c3b5**:\n- Threatens Nxc7+ \u2014 winning the rook on a8 if Black isn\u2019t careful.\n- Black must play ...a6 or ...Kc8 immediately.\n\nLet\u2019s test **c3b5**:\n\nIf 1. Nb5, Black must respond:\n- 1...a6 \u2014 blocks, knight retreats or exchanges.\n- 1...Kc8 \u2014 defends a8, but king is still exposed.\n- 1...Rb8? \u2014 then Nb5 still threatens Nxc7+.\n\nActually, after 1. Nb5, if Black doesn\u2019t play ...a6 or ...Kc8, then 2. Nxc7+ wins the rook.\n\nSo this is a real threat.\n\nCompare to c3d5 \u2014 no immediate material threat.\n\nTherefore, **c3b5** is the best move \u2014 it creates an immediate tactical threat (Nxc7+) and forces Black to weaken or waste time.\n\nThis is the most forcing and strongest move.\n\n```\nc3b5\n```",

The white knight on b5 can jump to **c7+**, forking king and rook!\n\nLet\u2019s test that:\n\n**Candidate Move: b5c7+**\n\nAfter `b5c7+`:\n- Black must move the king from d8\n- The only legal move is `Kd8xc7` (capturing the knight)\n- Then White plays `Ra1xa8#` \u2014 checkmate!\n\nBecause:\n- Black king is on c7\n- White rook on a1 moves to a8 \u2014 now it\u2019s delivering checkmate:\n  - King on c7\n  - Rook on a8 controls the 8th rank\n  - No escape squares: b7 is blocked by pawn, b8 is attacked by rook, d7 is occupied by bishop, d8 is empty but not accessible (king can\u2019t move into check from rook), and c8 is also attacked by rook\n  - So yes \u2014 **checkmate**\n\nThis is a classic **smothered mate** pattern enabled by the knight sacrifice.\n\n### Is this forced?\nYes:\n- If Black doesn\u2019t take the knight, `b5c7` gives check, and king must move \u2014 only square is c7.\n- Then `Rxa8#` is mate.\n\nNo other move by Black can prevent this \u2014 the knight on b5 is untouchable (only piece that could capture it is the rook on a8, which is pinned in a way \u2014 but even if it could, it wouldn\u2019t help).\n\n### Other candidate moves?\n- b5d6? Attacks e7 bishop, but allows Black time to consolidate \u2014 e.g., Ke8, and now no immediate mate.\n- Any king or rook shuffling (like g1h1 or a1e1) wastes time \u2014 Black can improve position.\n- Pushing pawns (like h2h3, etc.) is slow \u2014 we have a forced mate now.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis is a **forced mate in 2**:\n1. b5c7+ Kxc7\n2. Ra8#\n\nThis is the best and only winning move \u2014 anything else throws away the win.\n\n```\nb5c7\n```",

The most critical issue is the attack on the bishop by the white knight.\n\nThe bishop on e7 is under attack by the white knight on c7. The best defensive moves would be to either:\n1. Move the bishop to safety\n2. Defend it with another piece\n3. Counterattack in a way that maintains the bishop\n\nLooking at the options:\n- e7f8 would move the bishop to safety but leaves the king exposed\n- e7f6 would move the bishop but still leave the king vulnerable\n- e7d6 would move the bishop but still leave the king exposed\n- e7g5 would move the bishop but still leave the king exposed\n- e7c5 would move the bishop but still leave the king exposed\n- e7h4 would move the bishop but still leave the king exposed\n- e7b4 would move the bishop but still leave the king exposed\n- e7a3 would move the bishop but still leave the king exposed\n\nThe best defensive move appears to be e7f8, moving the bishop to safety while keeping the king somewhat protected by the rook on a8. This maintains the bishop's defensive role while getting it out of attack.\n\nOther moves like g8h8 or g8f8 would move the rook but don't address the immediate threat to the bishop.

Black has a rook on a8, bishop on f8, king on c8, and pawns on a7, b7, d7, h7.\n- Black's king is in the corner and extremely exposed \u2014 no castling rights, and it's stuck on c8.\n- White's knight on c7 is **attacking the black king directly** \u2014 it's a check!\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- Knight on c7, king on c8 \u2192 Knight attacks d5, b5, e6, a6, e8, a8 \u2014 and crucially, **b5, d5, e6, a6, e8, a8** \u2014 wait, is c7 attacking c8?\n\nNo! A knight on c7 does **not** attack c8 \u2014 it attacks:\n- b5, d5, e6, a6, e8, a8 \u2014 none of which is c8.\n\nSo it's **not** a check. That\u2019s critical.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the black king is on c8, and the white knight is on c7. That\u2019s adjacent \u2014 but knights don\u2019t attack adjacent squares orthogonally. So no check.\n\nNow, what is the threat?\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on c8, rook on a8, bishop on f8 \u2014 all undeveloped or stuck. The knight on c7 is **pinned against the black king** \u2014 because if it moves, the black king is exposed to the white rook on a1 along the a-file!\n\nLet\u2019s test that:\n\n- If White plays **c7e8**, the knight leaves c7 \u2192 now the rook on a1 has a clear file to the black king on c8 via a8-b8-c8? No \u2014 b8 is occupied by a black pawn.\n\nCurrent pawn structure on 7th rank: a7, b7, d7 \u2014 so b8 is empty? No \u2014 in the FEN: `r1bk1br1/ppNp3p/...` \u2014 so the second rank (black\u2019s 7th) is: a7, b7, d7, h7 \u2014 meaning c7 is occupied by White\u2019s knight, so b8 and d8 are open.\n\nWait \u2014 the black king is on c8, and the rook is on a8. So the a-file from a1 to a8 is open \u2014 and if the knight on c7 moves, then the rook on a1 can attack along the a-file, but the king is on c8 \u2014 not on the a-file.\n\nSo no immediate discovered attack.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key idea:\n\n**c7e8** \u2014 knight to e8 \u2014 this move attacks the black bishop on f8 (knight on e8 attacks f6, g7, d6, c7, c9 \u2014 wait, e8 attacks f6, g7, d6, c7 \u2014 and also **f6, g7, d6, c7, c9?** No \u2014 knight from e8 attacks:\n- d6, f6, g7, h6, h7? No \u2014 standard knight moves:\nFrom e8: d6, f6, g7, h6 \u2014 and also c7, c9? No \u2014 only:\n- d6 (down 2, left 1)\n- f6 (down 2, right 1)\n- g7 (down 1, right 2)\n- h6 (down 2, right 1? No \u2014 down 2 right 2 is g6 \u2014 wait, let\u2019s be precise.\n\nKnight from e8:\n- d6 (e\u2192d, 8\u21926)\n- f6 (e\u2192f, 8\u21926)\n- g7 (e\u2192g, 8\u21927)\n- h6 (e\u2192g\u2192h, 8\u21926? No \u2014 that\u2019s two right, two down \u2014 invalid.\n\nCorrect knight moves from e8:\n- d6\n- f6\n- g7\n- **c7**\n- **c9** \u2014 invalid\n- **g9** \u2014 invalid\n\nSo only: d6, f6, g7, c7 \u2014 none of which is f8.\n\nSo c7e8 does **not** attack the bishop on f8.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **c7a8**? Knight to a8 \u2014 that captures the rook! Is that legal?\n\nBlack rook is on a8 \u2014 so c7a8 would capture it.\n\nIs that safe?\n\nAfter c7a8, black can play ...Rxa8 \u2014 but wait, the rook is already on a8 \u2014 so c7a8 is a capture: knight takes rook on a8.\n\nIs that legal? Yes \u2014 knight from c7 to a8 is a valid L-move (two left, one up \u2014 c\u2192b\u2192a, 7\u21928).\n\nSo c7a8 is a **capture of the rook on a8**.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nAfter c7a8, Black must respond. What can they do?\n\n- King on c8 \u2014 no legal moves (b8 is blocked by b7 pawn, d8 by d7 pawn, c7 now occupied by nothing \u2014 but after c7a8, c7 is empty \u2014 so king can go to c7?\n\nHold on \u2014 after c7a8, the knight leaves c7 \u2014 so square c7 becomes empty.\n\nBlack king on c8 \u2014 can it move to c7?\n\nYes \u2014 c8 to c7 is one square up \u2014 and c7 is now empty.\n\nSo after 1. c7a8, Black can play **Kc7**, recapturing the knight? No \u2014 the knight is on a8, not c7.\n\nSo king moves to c7 \u2014 now the knight on a8 is safe \u2014 it's not under attack.\n\nSo material: White gains a rook for a knight \u2014 that\u2019s a huge advantage (rook > knight).\n\nBut is that the best?\n\nWait \u2014 what about **c7e6**?\n\nKnight to e6 \u2014 this attacks the black king on c8 via a discovered attack!\n\nBecause the rook on a1 now has a clear file \u2014 a1-a8 \u2014 and if the knight moves from c7 to e6, it uncovers the rook\u2019s line of attack on the black king!\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- Before move: rook on a1, knight on c7, king on c8 \u2014 the knight is between the rook and the king \u2014 so it\u2019s a **discovered check** waiting to happen.\n\nIf White plays **c7e6**, the knight moves away \u2014 and now the rook on a1 delivers check to the king on c8 \u2014 because the a-file is open, and the king is on c8 \u2014 but the rook attacks along the a-file \u2014 not the c-file.\n\nSo the rook on a1 attacks a8, a7, etc. \u2014 but the king is on c8 \u2014 not on the a-file.\n\nSo no discovered check.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a diagonal or file that connects a1 to c8?\n\nNo \u2014 a1 to c8 is a diagonal \u2014 but the rook doesn\u2019t move diagonally.\n\nSo no discovered check.\n\nHowever \u2014 what if the knight moves to **d5**?\n\nc7d5 \u2014 knight to d5.\n\nNow, d5 is one square away from c7 \u2014 and from d5, the knight attacks c7, b6, e7, f6, f4, e3, b4, c3 \u2014 not the king on c8.\n\nKing on c8 \u2014 knight on d5 \u2014 distance is one square diagonally \u2014 not a knight move.\n\nSo no check.\n\nNow, what about **c7b5**?\n\nKnight to b5 \u2014 attacks a7, c7, d6, d4, c3, a3 \u2014 not the king.\n\nStill no check.\n\nWait \u2014 what square would deliver check to the king on c8?\n\nKnight on d6 \u2014 that would be a check: d6 attacks c8.\n\nIs d6 accessible?\n\nFrom c7 to d5 \u2014 not d6.\n\nFrom c7 to d6 \u2014 that\u2019s one square right, one square down \u2014 not a knight move.\n\nKnight moves are L-shaped: 2 in one direction, 1 in perpendicular.\n\nSo from c7:\n- b5 (2 down, 1 left)\n- d5 (2 down, 1 right)\n- e6 (2 right, 1 down)\n- e8 (2 right, 1 up)\n- a6 (2 left, 1 down)\n- a8 (2 left, 1 up)\n\nNone of these is d6.\n\nSo no knight move from c7 gives check.\n\nSo back to the original idea:\n\n**c7a8** \u2014 captures the rook on a8 \u2014 and after Kc7, White is up a rook for nothing \u2014 because the knight is safe on a8.\n\nIs there a better move?\n\nWhat about **c7e6** \u2014 knight to e6.\n\nNow, from e6, the knight attacks d8, f8, g7, g5, f4, d4, c5, c7.\n\nd8 is occupied by a black pawn (from FEN: r1bk1br1 \u2014 so d8 is k \u2014 king",

The move history shows a complex sequence with pieces being moved around.\n\nThe most critical factor here is that Black's king is on d8, and White's king is on g1. The position appears to be a complex endgame where Black has the advantage due to better piece coordination.\n\nThe best move here is to activate the rook on g8 to put pressure on White's position.

Blocked by knight on b6\n  - c8 \u2192 d8? Blocked by own bishop\n  - c8 \u2192 c7? Currently occupied by nothing \u2014 but after Nb6+, Black must respond.\n  \nLet\u2019s simulate:\n- `a8b6+`  \n  Black king on c8:\n    - c8\u2013b8: illegal \u2014 b8 is attacked by knight on b6\n    - c8\u2013d8: illegal \u2014 occupied by own bishop\n    - c8\u2013c7: possible only if c7 is empty \u2014 it is!\n      - So king moves to c7: `c8c7`\n\nNow after `a8b6+`, Black must play `c8c7`.\n\nNow White can play: `b6d7+` (next move) \u2014 fork on king and rook on g7. But we must only pick one move now.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is `a8b6` even legal? Let's verify:\n- From a8 to b6: yes, that\u2019s a knight move.\n- Does it give check? Yes \u2014 b6 attacks c8.\n- Is the king in check after the move? Yes.\n- Can Black get out of check?\n  - Only by moving king to c7 (since b8 and d8 are not legal).\n  - So Black must play `c8c7`.\n\nThis is a **discovered attack** \u2014 the knight on b6 now attacks c8, and also opens the a-file for the rook on a1!\n\nAfter `a8b6+` and `c8c7`, White can then play `a1a7+` \u2014 skewering the king and rook!  \nBecause:\n- a7 attacks along the 7th rank \u2014 rook on g7 is on same rank.\n- After `a1a7+`, king must move from c7 \u2014 only to b8 or d8.\n  - If `c7b8`, then `a7xg7` wins the rook with material dominance.\n  - If `c7d8`, then `a7xg7` still wins rook \u2014 and Black is completely lost.\n\nSo `a8b6` is a **winning move**: it forces the king to c7, then rook to a7 wins material decisively.\n\nOther moves like `g1h1` or pawn moves are slow and let Black consolidate \u2014 for example, Black might play `d8e7` or `f8g7` to improve king safety.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n`a8b6` is the best move \u2014 it gives immediate check, forces the king to c7, and sets up a devastating discovered attack with the rook on the a-file.\n\n```\na8b6\n```",

The position shows:\n- Black has a bishop on f8 and a rook on g7\n- White has a knight on b6 (from the move history)\n- The kings are on g1 (White) and g8 (Black)\n- The board shows some pawn structure with pawns on a7, b7, d7, h7 for Black\n\nFrom the move history, we can see the game has been going on with some exchanges, and we're at move 24.\n\nLooking at the legal moves provided, we need to choose the best one for Black. The key factors to consider:\n1. King safety: Black's king is on g8, which is relatively safe but could be vulnerable to checks\n2. Piece activity: Black's rook on g7 is well-placed, and the bishop on f8 has some mobility\n3. Potential threats: White's knight on b6 could be a threat if it can reach key squares\n\nThe legal moves include several options for the bishop (f8e7, f8d6, etc.), some rook moves (g7g8, g7f7, etc.), and some pawn moves (a7b6, h7h6, etc.).\n\nThe most critical move appears to be g7g8, which would:\n- Move the rook to g8, putting pressure on White's king\n- Potentially create mating threats if combined with other pieces\n- Maintain control of the g-file\n\nOther options like f8e7 or f8d6 would move the bishop but don't create immediate threats. The pawn moves (a7b6, h7h6, etc.) are less critical at this stage.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to activate the rook with:\n\n```\ng7g8\n```",

Wait \u2014 no rook on a8.\n\nWait \u2014 current position:  \nBlack king on c8, rook on f8, bishop on g8 \u2014 no rook on a8.\n\nSo if black moves Kb8, white plays **Na8!** \u2014 knight to a8, attacking the king on b8.\n\nThen black must move king again \u2014 only to a8 or c8 \u2014 but a8 is now occupied by knight, so king must go to c8 \u2014 back to start?\n\nNo \u2014 after Na8+, king on b8 must move:\n- a8 \u274c (occupied)\n- c8 \u2705 \u2014 but c8 is attacked by knight on a8?  \nKnight on a8 attacks b6, c7, c9 (invalid), b10 (invalid) \u2014 actually, knight on a8 attacks:\n- b6, c7 \u2014 that\u2019s it.\n\nSo c8 is **not attacked** by knight on a8.\n\nSo king on b8 after Na8+ can go to c8 \u2014 and then we\u2019re back to original square.\n\nThis is a **perpetual chase**, not a win.\n\nSo we must find a better move.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the legal moves again:\n\n```\nb6c8, b6a8, b6d7, b6d5, b6c4, b6a4, g1h1, g1f1, a1f1, a1e1, a1d1, a1c1, a1b1, h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4\n```\n\nThe key idea: **b6c8** \u2014 knight takes the black king\u2019s square \u2014 c8 \u2014 which is currently occupied by the black king.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that legal?  \nNo \u2014 you can\u2019t move to a square occupied by your own king or opponent\u2019s king.  \nSo **b6c8 is illegal** \u2014 because the black king is on c8.\n\nSo that move is not actually legal \u2014 the engine or move generator must have included it by mistake.\n\nSimilarly, **b6d7** \u2014 d7 is occupied by a black pawn \u2014 so that\u2019s a capture. Is it legal?\n\nYes \u2014 if d7 is occupied by a black pawn, then b6d7 is a legal capture.\n\nLet\u2019s test that:\n\nAfter **b6xd7**, what happens?\n\n- Knight captures on d7 \u2014 removes black pawn\n- Now, black king on c8 \u2014 is it in check?\n\nKnight on d7 attacks:\n- b6, c5, e5, f6, f8, e9 (invalid), c9 (invalid), b8\n\nSo knight on d7 attacks **b8 and f8** \u2014 not c8.\n\nSo king on c8 is **not in check** \u2014 so this is just a quiet capture \u2014 and black can then play Kb8 or d8 \u2014 and the initiative is lost.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat about **b6a8** \u2014 knight to a8?\n\n- Then black king must move \u2014 to b8 or d8\n- If Kb8 \u2014 then knight on a8 attacks b6 and c7 \u2014 not the king \u2014 so no check\n- So black can consolidate \u2014 not good\n\nWhat about **b6d5** \u2014 centralizing knight \u2014 but no immediate threat\n\nWhat about **b6c4** \u2014 same\n\nNow, what if we consider **rook moves**?\n\nRook on a1 \u2014 can move along the 1st rank or a-file.\n\nBlack king is on c8 \u2014 so if we can get the rook to the 8th rank, it could be powerful.\n\nBut currently, the rook is blocked by nothing \u2014 it can go to a8 safely?\n\na1a8 \u2014 but that move is not listed in legal moves \u2014 why?\n\nBecause in the legal moves list, we have: a1f1, a1e1, a1d1, a1c1, a1b1 \u2014 so rook can move horizontally on 1st rank \u2014 but not vertically.\n\nWhy can\u2019t rook go to a8?\n\nBecause there\u2019s a piece in the way \u2014 the knight on b6 is on b6, not on the a-file \u2014 so the a-file is clear from a1 to a8.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s strange.\n\nFEN: `2bk1br1/pp1p3p/1N6/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - - 3 25`\n\nSo on a-file: a1 (rook), a2 (pawn), a3 (empty), a4 (empty), ..., a8 \u2014 empty.\n\nSo rook should be able to go to a8 \u2014 but it\u2019s not in the legal moves list.\n\nThat suggests the legal move generator is correct \u2014 so perhaps the rook **cannot** go to a8 \u2014 why?\n\nBecause if rook moves to a8, it would leave the king in check?\n\nNo \u2014 king is on g1 \u2014 no check.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the knight on b6 is pinned?  \nIs the king on g1 in check? No \u2014 no black pieces attack g1.\n\nSo rook should be able to move to a8 \u2014 but it\u2019s not in the list.\n\nThis implies that the legal move list is incomplete \u2014 or we are missing something.\n\nBut we must work with what\u2019s given.\n\nNow, the best move must be one that **maintains the initiative** \u2014 the knight on b6 is already giving check.\n\nSo the only way to improve is to **deliver check that forces a decisive outcome**.\n\nLet\u2019s try **b6d7** again \u2014 but as we saw, it\u2019s not check \u2014 so black can just move king and consolidate.\n\nWhat about **b6a4** or **b6c4** \u2014 no\n\nWait \u2014 what if we play **a1a8+** \u2014 but it\u2019s not in the legal moves \u2014 so we can\u2019t.\n\nHold on \u2014 perhaps the",

No \u2014 knight is on a8 now\n\nThis loops \u2014 perpetual \u2014 draw.\n\nWe must **avoid letting black escape to b8**.\n\nSo the only way to prevent Kb8 is to **control b8** \u2014 but knight on b6 already attacks b8?  \nNo \u2014 knight on b6 attacks:\n- a8, c8 \u2705, d7, d5, c4, a4 \u2014 **not b8**\n\nSo b8 is not attacked.\n\nBut if we move the knight to **a4**, it attacks b6 and c5 \u2014 not helpful.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we move the knight to **d5**?\n\n`b6d5` \u2014 knight to d5 \u2014 not check \u2014 black plays Kb8 \u2014 and we lose.\n\nNo.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the critical realization:\n\nThe only way to **force mate** is to **cut off the king\u2019s escape** \u2014 and the only square that matters is **b8**.\n\nHow can we attack b8?\n\nKnight on b6 \u2192 doesn\u2019t attack b8  \nKnight on a8 \u2192 attacks b6 and c7 \u2014 not b8  \nKnight on c7 \u2192 attacks b5, d5, e6, e8, d9, b9 \u2014 not b8  \nKnight on a4 \u2192 no  \nKnight on c4 \u2192 no  \nKnight on d7 \u2192 attacks b6, c5, e5, f6, f8, e9 \u2014 not b8  \n\nOnly knight on **a6** attacks b8 \u2014 but we don\u2019t have a knight there.\n\nSo no knight move directly attacks b8.\n\nBut \u2014 what if we play:\n\n### `a1a8` \u2014 rook to a8 \u2014 but it\u2019s not in the legal moves list.\n\nSo we **cannot** play it \u2014 either it\u2019s illegal (e.g., if it leaves king in check \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t), or the move generator is wrong.\n\nWe must work with what\u2019s given.\n\nNow, the only move that **immediately continues the threat** and forces black into a worse position is:\n\n### `b6d7`\n\nWhy?\n\n- It removes a defender (the d7 pawn)\n- It opens the a2-g8 diagonal for the white rook \u2014 now the rook on a1 can potentially control the 7th or 8th rank\n- Most importantly: after `b6d7`, black must move king \u2014 to b8 or d8\n  - If black plays `c8b8`, then white plays `a1a8+` \u2014 but again, not in legal moves \u2014 so maybe blocked?\n\nWait \u2014 after `b6d7`, the d7 pawn is gone \u2014 now the a1 rook has a clear path to a8 \u2014 so why wasn\u2019t `a1a8` legal before?\n\nBecause before, the d7 pawn was still there \u2014 no, the d7 pawn doesn\u2019t block the a-file.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t explain it.\n\nPerhaps the rook cannot go to a8 because it would leave the king in check \u2014 but no black piece attacks g1.\n\nThis is a mystery \u2014 but we must choose from the list.\n\nNow, among all knight moves, the one that **maintains the most flexibility** and **controls central squares** is:\n\n### `b6d5`\n\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks c7, e6, f7 \u2014 all key squares near black king\n- After black moves king to b8 or d8, white can follow up with rook lift or knight maneuver\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t force mate.\n\nWait \u2014 what if black plays `c8d8` after `b6d5`?\n\nThen white plays `a1a8+` \u2014 again, not in legal moves \u2014 so maybe it\u2019s not possible.\n\nWe\u2019re stuck.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different approach.\n\nWhat if we play:\n\n### `a1c1`\n\nRook to c1 \u2014 threatening Rc8# \u2014 because the knight on b6 already attacks c8 \u2014 so if rook goes to c1, then next move Rc8# is mate \u2014 unless black stops it.\n\nCan black stop Rc8#?\n\n- Only by moving the king \u2014 but king is in check from knight on b6 \u2014 so black must move king first \u2014 to b8 or d8\n- If black moves king to d8 \u2014 then white plays `a1c1` (already done), then next move `c1c8#` \u2014 checkmate!\n\nBecause:\n- King on d8\n- Rook on c8 \u2014 checks king\n- King cannot go to c8 (rook), d7 (knight), e8 (no piece but rook doesn\u2019t attack e8)\n- But wait \u2014 is e8 attacked?\n\nKnight on b6 attacks d7 \u2014 not e8  \nRook on c8 attacks entire 8th rank \u2014 so e8 is attacked.\n\nSo king on d8, after Rc8+, has no escape:\n- c8 \u2014 rook\n- d7 \u2014 knight\n- e8 \u2014 rook\n\n\u2705 **Checkmate**\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Play `a1c1` \u2014 rook to c1\n2. Black must move king \u2014 only to b8 or d8\n3. If to d8 \u2014 then `c1c8#` is mate\n4. If to b8 \u2014 then white can play `b6a8+`, forcing king back to c8 \u2014 and repeat\n\nBut if black plays Kb8, then white plays `b6a8+`, king must go to c8 \u2014 and now white plays `c1c8#` \u2014 again mate!\n\nBecause:\n- King on c8\n- Rook on c8 \u2014 check\n- King cannot go to b8 (a8 knight attacks b6 and c7 \u2014 not b8)\n- d8 \u2014 rook attacks\n- b7 \u2014 knight on a8 attacks b6 and c7 \u2014 not b7\n- d7 \u2014 knight on a8 doesn\u2019t attack d7 \u2014 but knight on a8 attacks c7 \u2014 not d7\n\nWait \u2014 is d7 attacked?\n\nKnight on a8 attacks:\n- b6, c7 \u2014 that\u2019s it\n\nSo king on c8 after Rc8+ has:\n- b8 \u2014 not attacked \u2705\n- d8 \u2014 rook attacks \u274c\n- c7 \u2014 knight on a8 attacks \u2705\n- b7 \u2014 not attacked \u2705\n- d7 \u2014 not attacked \u2705\n\nSo king can escape to b7 or b8 \u2014 not mate!\n\nOh no \u2014 so if black plays Kb8, and we play Na8+, king goes to c8 \u2014 then Rc8+ allows king to escape to b7 or b8 \u2014 not mate.\n\nSo only if black plays Kd8 after `a1c1`, then `c1c8#` is mate \u2014 because d8 king has no escape.\n\nBut if black plays Kb8 \u2014 we don\u2019t get immediate mate.\n\nSo `a1c1` is risky \u2014 black can escape to b8 and survive.\n\nNow, what if we play:\n\n### `b6d7` \u2014 capture on d7\n\nThen black must move king \u2014 to b8 or d8\n\nIf black plays `c8d8` \u2014 then white plays `a1a8+` \u2014",

So, Black has a material advantage in terms of the value of the pieces.\n- **Piece Activity**: White's knight on d7 is well - placed, attacking the black king's position. Black's pieces need to coordinate better to use their material advantage.\n- **King Safety**: White's king is relatively safe on g1, while Black's king on g8 is a bit exposed.\n\n### Candidate Moves Analysis\n1. **g8h8**: This move takes the king to a corner square. It might seem like a way to avoid immediate threats, but it limits the king's mobility and doesn't actively use the material advantage.\n2. **f8g7**: This move brings the bishop to a more active square. It can potentially attack the white knight on d7 and also control important diagonals. It helps in coordinating the black pieces better.\n3. **d8e8**: Moving the rook to e8 can put pressure on the e - file. However, it doesn't directly deal with the threat of the white knight on d7.\n\n### Final Move Selection\nThe move `f8g7` seems to be the best option. It activates the bishop, which is currently passive. By moving to g7, the bishop can attack the white knight on d7 and also control important squares around the white king. This move helps in using the material advantage and putting pressure on White.\n\n```\nf8g7\n```",

No check.\n\nHold on \u2014 is there a move that gives **check** and wins material?\n\nLet\u2019s look again:  \nBlack king is on c8.  \nKnight on d7.  \nFrom d7, knight moves to:\n- b6 \u2014 c8 not attacked\n- b8 \u2014 c8 not attacked\n- f6 \u2014 no\n- f8 \u2014 no\n- e5 \u2014 no\n- c5 \u2014 **YES!**\n\nFrom c5, the knight attacks **b7**, **d7**, **e6**, and **a6** \u2014 but not c8.\n\nWait \u2014 none of the knight moves give check to c8?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check knight moves from d7:\n- d7 \u2192 b8: b8 is a square, but c8 not attacked\n- d7 \u2192 f8: same\n- d7 \u2192 b6: b6 \u2014 no\n- d7 \u2192 f6: no\n- d7 \u2192 e5: no\n- d7 \u2192 c5: no\n\nSo none of the knight moves give check. But the knight is already attacking both king and rook \u2014 it\u2019s a **discovered attack** waiting to happen.\n\nBut the knight is **pinned**? No \u2014 no piece between king and knight. So it\u2019s free to move.\n\nNow, if the knight moves from d7, it will **no longer attack the rook on g8**, and the rook can escape.\n\nSo the key idea is: **capture the rook immediately**.\n\nIs the rook on g8 defended?\n\n- Black has only king, rook, bishop on g7, and pawns on a7, b7.\n- The bishop on g7 does **not** defend g8 \u2014 it\u2019s on a dark square, g8 is dark, but the bishop is on g7, so it does attack g8?  \n  - g7 to g8 \u2014 same file \u2014 no, bishop moves diagonally.  \n  - g7 to g8 is vertical \u2014 not a bishop move.  \n  - So bishop on g7 does **not** defend g8.\n\nTherefore, **the rook on g8 is undefended**.\n\nSo if White plays `d7f8`, the knight lands on f8, capturing the rook \u2014 and it\u2019s a legal move.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- d7 to f8: is that a valid knight move?\n  - Knight moves in L-shape: 2 squares in one direction, 1 in perpendicular.\n  - From d7 to f8: that\u2019s 2 files right (d\u2192e\u2192f), 1 rank up (7\u21928). Yes \u2014 valid knight move.\n- Does it capture the rook? Yes \u2014 rook is on f8? No \u2014 rook is on g8.\n\nWait! Big mistake!\n\nThe rook is on **g8**, not f8.\n\nSo `d7f8` moves to f8 \u2014 which is empty \u2014 and does **not** capture the rook.\n\nTo capture the rook on g8, the knight must move to **f6** or **h6** \u2014 but from d7, can it reach g8?\n\nKnight from d7 to g8:  \n- d7 \u2192 e5 \u2192 g6 \u2192 h8 \u2192 g6 \u2014 no, not a single move.\n\nKnight moves from d7:\n- b6, b8, c5, e5, f6, f8 \u2014 none of these is g8.\n\nSo the knight **cannot capture the rook directly** \u2014 it only attacks it from d7.\n\nThat means: if the knight moves, the rook is no longer under attack and can flee.\n\nSo we must **not** move the knight unless it gives check or wins more.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we move the knight to a square where it gives check AND the rook is still lost?\n\nIs there any knight move from d7 that gives check to the black king on c8?\n\nKnight from d7 to:\n- b6 \u2014 not attacking c8\n- b8 \u2014 not attacking c8\n- c5 \u2014 not attacking c8\n- e5 \u2014 no\n- f6 \u2014 no\n- f8 \u2014 no\n\nNone of them attack c8.\n\nSo the knight on d7 is forking king and rook, but cannot capture either in one move.\n\nThis is a classic **absolute fork** \u2014 but only as long as the knight stays on d7.\n\nIf we move it, the fork is broken.\n\nSo why is this position so strong?\n\nBecause if Black moves, they must address the fork \u2014 but it\u2019s White to move!\n\nSo we must make a move that **maintains the threat** or **forces a win**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at other options:\n\nWhite king moves: g1h1, g1f1 \u2014 safe, but do nothing\nRook moves: a1 to any square \u2014 but rook is passive\nPawn moves \u2014 mostly non-threatening\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:\n\nIf White does **nothing**, Black can play ...Rg8-g7 or ...Rg8-f8, escaping the fork.\n\nSo we must **force** Black to lose material.\n\nHow?\n\nThe best move is to **move the knight to b8** \u2014 `d7b8`.\n\nWhy?\n\n- Knight from d7 to b8: valid move\n- Now, the knight attacks c6 and a6 \u2014 but more importantly, it\u2019s still on the board\n- But does it maintain pressure?\n\nNo \u2014 now the knight is not attacking the rook or king.\n\nWait \u2014 this is bad.\n\nHold on \u2014 what if we play:\n\n**d7f6+** \u2014 knight to f6, giving check to the black king?\n\nIs f6 attacked by the knight from d7?\n\nd7 to f6: 2 files right (d\u2192e\u2192f), 1 rank down (7\u21926) \u2014 yes, valid knight move.\n\nNow, does f6 attack c8?\n\nKnight on f6 attacks:\n- d5, d7, e4, g4, h5, h7 \u2014 not c8.\n\nSo not a check.\n\nWait \u2014 what square from d7 gives check to c8?\n\nKnight must be on a square that attacks c8.\n\nSquares that attack c8:\n- a7, b6, d6, e7 \u2014 none of which are reachable from d7 in one move.\n\nSo no knight move gives check.\n\nThis is critical: the knight on d7 is forking king and rook, but cannot deliver check or capture either in one move.\n\nSo the best plan is to **do nothing that breaks the fork**, but force Black to lose the rook.\n\nHow?\n\nBy making a **waiting move** \u2014 a move that does not break the fork, but forces Black to move into a losing position.\n\nBut if we move the rook or king or pawn, the knight stays on d7 \u2014 so the fork remains.\n\nSo any quiet move that doesn\u2019t involve the knight will keep the fork intact.\n\nNow, Black must move \u2014 and whatever they do, they lose the rook.\n\nFor example:\n- If Black moves the rook, White captures with Nxd7 or just takes it if it moves off the g-file.\n- If Black moves the king, White plays Nxf8 and captures the rook.\n- If Black moves the bishop or a pawn, same \u2014 White takes rook on g8.\n\nSo the best move is a **waiting move** \u2014 any move that doesn\u2019t break the fork.\n\nThe simplest is a pawn move like `h2h3` or `g2g3` \u2014 harmless, but keeps the knight on d7.\n\nBut we must be cautious: is there any chance Black can interpose or escape?\n\nNo \u2014 the rook is on g8, king on c8 \u2014 no interposition possible.\n\nSo any quiet move wins.\n\nBut to be precise \u2014 the best waiting",

No \u2014 FEN says `2bk3r` \u2014 so on a8\u2013h8: 2nd square is b8 \u2014 \"b\" file is the second letter \u2014 so `2b` means two empty, then a black piece on b8? No:\n\nFEN breakdown for rank 8: `2bk3r`  \n- 2 = two empty squares (a8, b8)\n- b = black bishop? No \u2014 lowercase 'b' in FEN is a **black bishop**\n- k = black king\n- 3 = three empty squares\n- r = black rook\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be. Because the king is on c8, per the FEN: `2bk3r` \u2014 that would mean:\n- a8: empty\n- b8: black bishop\n- c8: black king\n- d8: empty\n- e8\u2013g8: empty\n- h8: black rook\n\nYes! So:\n- b8: black bishop\n- c8: black king\n- h8: black rook\n\nSo now, knight on d7 to b8: **d7b8**\n\nWhat happens?\n- Knight captures the black bishop on b8 \u2014 and now attacks the black king on c8!\n- So: **d7b8 is a check** \u2014 because knight on b8 attacks c6 and a6 \u2014 wait, does it attack c8?\n\nKnight on b8 attacks:\n- a6, c6, d7 \u2014 **not c8**\n\nSo again \u2014 not a check.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet\u2019s map knight moves from d7:\n- c5, b6, e5, f6, f8, b8 \u2014 all legal per the given list.\n\nNow, which of these gives the strongest advantage?\n\nLet\u2019s look for a **fork**.\n\nBlack king on c8. What square would allow the knight to attack both king and another piece?\n\nIf knight goes to **e5**, it attacks:\n- c6, d7, f7, g6 \u2014 not c8.\n\nIf knight goes to **b6**, attacks:\n- a8, c8, d5, c4 \u2014 **YES! c8!**\n\nSo: **d7b6** \u2014 knight to b6.\n\nNow:\n- Knight on b6 attacks c8 (black king) \u2014 so it\u2019s a **check**\n- Also attacks a8 and d5 \u2014 but more importantly, what else is on b6\u2019s attack lines?\n\nDoes it attack any other black piece?\n\nBlack has:\n- King on c8\n- Bishop on g7\n- Rook on h8\n- Pawns on a7, b7\n\nSo when knight moves to b6:\n- Checks the king on c8\n- Also attacks a8 \u2014 which is empty\n- And d5 \u2014 empty\n\nSo it\u2019s just a check \u2014 no fork.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a discovered attack?\n\nNo \u2014 because the knight is the only piece in line with the king.\n\nHold on \u2014 what if the knight moves to **f6**?\n\nd7f6:\n- Knight on f6 attacks d5, e4, g4, h5, and also **d7 and e8** \u2014 not c8.\n\nNo check.\n\nWhat about **d7e5**?\n\ne5 \u2014 attacks c6, d7, f7, g6 \u2014 not c8.\n\nNothing.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **d7b8** \u2014 capturing the black bishop on b8?\n\nThat\u2019s a free piece! Black bishop on b8 \u2014 undefended?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n- Black bishop on b8 \u2014 is it protected?\n\nBlack pieces:\n- King on c8\n- Bishop on g7\n- Rook on h8\n- Pawns on a7, b7\n\nb8 bishop \u2014 is it protected by anything?\n\nb7 pawn \u2014 no, it doesn\u2019t protect b8.\ng7 bishop \u2014 no.\nrook on h8 \u2014 no.\nking on c8 \u2014 no, too far.\n\nSo **b8 bishop is undefended**!\n\nTherefore, **d7b8** is a free capture \u2014 and it\u2019s a legal move.\n\nAfter d7b8:\n- White gains a bishop for free\n- Material advantage becomes crushing: White now has knight + bishop vs. just bishop and rook for Black \u2014 but more importantly, Black\u2019s king is exposed.\n\nIs there any threat after d7b8?\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on c8 \u2014 no immediate check \u2014 but now White can follow up with:\n- Ra1\u2013a8+ \u2014 winning the rook on h8 via back-rank pressure.\n\nBecause after d7b8:\n- Black must respond \u2014 say, Kb8 or something \u2014 but then Ra8+ wins the rook.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. d7b8 Bxb8  \nNow Black recaptures \u2014 but that\u2019s fine \u2014 White is up a piece.\n\nWait \u2014 no! If Black has a bishop on b8, and White plays d7b8 (capturing it), then Black must recapture with the king: Kxb8 \u2014 because no other piece can.\n\nSo:\n1. d7b8 Kxb8\n\nNow Black king is on b8 \u2014 exposed on the back rank.\n\nWhite has rook on a1 \u2014 can now play Ra1\u2013a8+ \u2014 check!\n\nBlack king must move \u2014 only to a7 or b7 \u2014 both of which allow White to win the rook on h8 or continue crushing pressure.\n\nFor example:\n1. d7b8 Kxb8  \n2. Ra8+ Kb7  \n3. Rxa7+ Kb6 \u2014 and now White can bring in the king or play b4-b5 etc. \u2014 but actually, even better: after 2... Kb7, White plays Rxb8 \u2014 winning the rook!\n\nBecause after 2. Ra8+ Kb7, then 3. Rxb8+ \u2014 wins the rook outright.\n\nSo this is a **winning sequence**.\n\nIs there a faster win?\n\nWhat about **d7f8**?  \nKnight to f8 \u2014 not a check, but then Black can play ...Rxf8 \u2014 losing the rook for nothing? No \u2014 because then White recaptures with the rook or king \u2014 but that\u2019s just equal material.\n\nNo \u2014 d7b8 is clearly the best move: it wins material immediately and leads to a forced win of the rook next.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is **d7b8** \u2014 captures the undefended black bishop on b8, forces the king to recapture, and then White wins the rook on a8+.\n\nNo other move offers such a clear, immediate material gain with a forced win.\n\n```\nd7b8\n```",

The position shows:\n- Black has a bishop on c8 and a rook on h8\n- White has a knight on b8 and a rook on a1\n- The kings are on g1 (White) and g8 (Black)\n- There are pawns on both sides, but the position is somewhat open\n\nLooking at the legal moves, we need to find the best option for Black. The key features:\n1. Black's rook on h8 is currently attacking White's pawn on h3\n2. White's knight on b8 is well-placed but not immediately threatening\n3. The kings are in relatively safe positions\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- h8g8: This would move the rook away from the h-file, losing pressure on h3\n- h8f8: Similar to h8g8, moving the rook away from the h-file\n- h8e8: Also moving the rook away from the h-file\n- d8e8: This would be a bishop move, but d8 isn't occupied in the FEN\n- d8e7: Same issue, d8 isn't occupied\n- d8c7: Same issue\n- c8d7: This would be a bishop move, but c8 is occupied by a bishop\n- c8e6: Bishop move, but e6 isn't a good square\n- c8f5: Bishop move, but f5 isn't a good square\n- c8g4: Bishop move, but g4 isn't a good square\n- c8h3: Bishop move, but h3 is occupied by a pawn\n- g7f8: This would be a king move, but g7 is occupied by a bishop\n- g7h6: King move, but g7 is occupied\n- g7f6: King move, but g7 is occupied\n- g7e5: King move, but g7 is occupied\n- g7d4: King move, but g7 is occupied\n- g7c3: King move, but g7 is occupied\n- g7b2: King move, but g7 is occupied\n- h7h6: Pawn move, but h7 is occupied by a bishop\n- b7b6: Pawn move, but b7 is occupied by a pawn\n- a7a6: Pawn move, but a7 is occupied by a pawn\n- h7h5: Pawn move, but h7 is occupied by a bishop\n- b7b5: Pawn move, but b7 is occupied by a pawn\n- a7a5: Pawn move, but a7 is occupied by a pawn\n\nThe best move appears to be h8g8, which:\n1. Maintains pressure on White's h3 pawn\n2. Keeps the rook on the h-file where it can potentially attack White's king\n3. Doesn't lose material or position\n\nOther moves either move the rook away from the h-file or involve pieces that aren't in the correct positions.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh8g8\n```",

Other moves like g1h1 or a1 moves are slow \u2014 Black can untangle.\n\n**Let\u2019s calculate the critical line:**\n\n**1. b8d7+!**  \nBlack must play **Kxd7** (only legal move \u2014 can\u2019t block or capture knight).  \nNow White plays **a1d1+** \u2014 check along the d-file!  \nBlack king has no escape:  \n- Kc8? Rd8#  \n- Ke8? Rd8#  \n- Kc6? Rd6+ wins queen-side pawns or mates soon  \nActually, after **a1d1+**, Black has no legal square for the king that doesn\u2019t lead to immediate mate or rook loss.\n\nLet\u2019s test:\n- After 1. b8d7+ Kxd7 2. a1d1+  \n  Black king on d7, now:\n  - Ke8? Rd8#  \n  - Kc6? Rd6+ wins b7 or forces Kc5, then Rd5+  \n  - Kc8? Rd8#  \n  - Ke6? Rd6+  \n  - All king moves lose immediately or within 1\u20132 moves.\n\nIn fact, **2. Rd1+** is mate in 1 if Black king is on d7 \u2014 because all adjacent squares (c6, c7, c8, e6, e7, e8) are either occupied or attacked.\n\nWait \u2014 is it mate?\n\nAfter:\n1. b8d7+ Kxd7  \n2. a1d1#\n\nYes! Because:\n- d7 is attacked by Rd1\n- c6, c7, c8, e6, e7, e8 \u2014 all are either occupied or attacked\n- c6: b7 pawn\n- c7: b7 pawn\n- c8: a7 and b7 pawns\n- e6: not directly attacked yet, but king can\u2019t go there from d7 \u2014 it\u2019s 2 squares away\nWait \u2014 hold on! The king on d7 has these legal moves:\n- c6\n- c7\n- c8\n- e6\n- e7\n- e8\n\nBut none of these are safe:\n- c6: Rd1 attacks c6? No \u2014 Rd1 attacks d-file only. So c6 is not attacked.\n- c7: not attacked\n- c8: not attacked\n- e6: not attacked\n- e7: not attacked\n- e8: not attacked\n\nSo it\u2019s **not mate** \u2014 but it is a devastating discovered check with the rook, and Black is completely lost.\n\nAfter 1. b8d7+ Kxd7 2. a1d1+, Black must move king to one of those squares \u2014 all of which are terrible:\n- Kc6: Rd6+ wins b7 pawn, then Kb5 or similar, and White\u2019s king marches in\n- Kc7: Rd7+ wins the king\n- Kc8: Rd8# \u2014 yes! That\u2019s mate!\n- Ke6: Rd6+ wins material\n- Ke7: Rd7+ wins king\n- Ke8: Rd8#\n\nSo if Black plays Kc8 or Ke8 after Rd1+, it\u2019s mate.\n\nBut Black can play **Kc7** or **Ke7** to avoid immediate mate \u2014 but then Rd7+ wins the king.\n\nSo after:\n1. b8d7+ Kxd7  \n2. a1d1+  \nIf Black plays **Kc7**, then 3. Rd7# \u2014 because c7 is attacked by rook, and no escape.\n\nSimilarly, if Black plays Ke7, then 3. Rd7#.\n\nSo actually, **after 1. b8d7+ Kxd7 2. a1d1+**, any king move leads to mate on the next move.\n\nTherefore, **b8d7** is a forced mate in 3.\n\nThis is the best possible move \u2014 it wins immediately.\n\nOther moves allow Black to survive or even draw (e.g., if White plays passively, Black might free the bishop or activate the rook).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe only move that wins instantly is **b8d7**.\n\n```\nb8d7\n```",

The position shows:\n- Black has a rook on g8 and a bishop on g7\n- White has a knight on d7 and a pawn on h3\n- The kings are on g1 (White) and g8 (Black)\n- Black's king is in check from the knight on d7\n\nLooking at the legal moves, we need to address the check first. The knight on d7 is checking Black's king on g8. The legal moves show several options for moving the king or blocking the check.\n\nThe best move here is to move the king out of check while maintaining the initiative. The move g8h8 (king moves to h8) is the most straightforward way to get out of check while keeping the rook on g8 protected.\n\nOther options like g8f8 or g8e8 would also get out of check but might expose the king more. Moving the king to h8 maintains the defensive structure and keeps the rook protected.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng8h8\n```",

No \u2014 knight on f8 attacks d7, e6, g6, h7 \u2014 not b8.\nWait \u2014 knight on f8 attacks:\n- d7 (occupied by nothing now),\n- e6,\n- g6,\n- h7,\n- and also d9? No \u2014 standard knight moves.\n\nActually, knight on f8 attacks:\n- d7, e6, g6, h7 \u2014 none of which are near c8.\n\nSo `d7f8` does **not** give check \u2014 it just occupies f8.\n\nBut that might be a trap \u2014 because after `d7f8`, Black plays `h8xf8`, capturing the knight \u2014 and now White has lost the knight for no gain.\n\nSo that\u2019s bad.\n\nWhat about **d7b8**?\n- Knight to b8 \u2014 that square is occupied by the black king\u2019s only escape square!\n- If knight goes to b8, it gives check: **Ndb8+**!\n- Black king must move from c8 \u2014 only legal square is b8? No \u2014 b8 is now attacked by the knight.\n- So king has no legal moves \u2014 **checkmate**?\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- Black king on c8.\n- Knight moves from d7 to b8 \u2014 that\u2019s a valid knight move (L-shape: 2 up, 1 left).\n- After `d7b8`, the black king is in check \u2014 because knight on b8 attacks c6, a6, c10? No \u2014 standard knight moves:\n  - From b8, knight attacks:\n    - a6\n    - c6\n    - d7\n    - d9? No \u2014 only:\n    - a6, c6, d7 \u2014 and crucially, **c8** \u2014 yes! b8 to c8 is a knight move? No \u2014 knight moves in L-shape: 2 in one direction, 1 perpendicular.\n\nFrom b8:\n- 2 down, 1 right \u2192 d7\n- 2 down, 1 left \u2192 off board\n- 2 right, 1 up \u2192 off board\n- 2 left, 1 up \u2192 off board\n- 2 up, 1 right \u2192 c6\n- 2 up, 1 left \u2192 a6\n- 2 right, 1 down \u2192 d7 again\n- etc.\n\nSo knight on b8 does **not** attack c8 \u2014 it attacks a6, c6, d7 \u2014 none of which are the black king.\n\nSo `d7b8` is just a quiet move \u2014 and Black can play `Kc8-b8`, capturing the knight if it lands there \u2014 because b8 is empty.\n\nWait \u2014 is b8 empty?\nYes \u2014 in the FEN: `2bk3r` \u2014 so on the 8th rank: a8=empty, b8=empty, c8=king, d8=empty, e8=empty, f8=empty, g8=empty, h8=rook.\n\nSo b8 is empty.\n\nSo if White plays `d7b8`, Black can reply `c8b8` \u2014 king captures knight \u2014 and now White has traded a knight for a king move \u2014 not good.\n\nSo that\u2019s bad.\n\nWhat about **d7f6**? That\u2019s a quiet move \u2014 not forcing.\n\nHow about **d7e5**? Also quiet.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a forced mate?\n\nLet\u2019s look again.\n\nThe black king is on c8, rook on h8, bishop on g7 \u2014 no defenders near the king.\n\nWhite has a knight on d7 \u2014 and it can deliver mate if it lands on b6 or c5.\n\nTry **d7b6+** \u2014 knight to b6, giving check.\n\nAfter `d7b6+`:\n- King must move from c8 \u2014 only legal square is b8.\n- So Black plays `c8b8`.\n\nNow, what?\n- White has knight on b6, king on g1, rook on a1.\n- Black king on b8, rook on h8, bishop on g7.\n\nNow, White can play **a1a8+** \u2014 rook to a8 check!\n\n- Black king must move \u2014 only square is c7? No \u2014 b8 to c7 is possible? Yes \u2014 but is it legal?\n\nAfter `a1a8+`, king on b8 must move:\n- a8 \u2014 occupied by rook\n- c8 \u2014 attacked by knight on b6\n- a7 \u2014 possibly safe?\n- c7 \u2014 possibly safe?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n- From b8, king can go to:\n  - a8 (attacked by rook \u2014 no)\n  - a7 (safe?)\n  - b7 (safe?)\n  - c7 (safe?)\n  - c8 (attacked by knight on b6 \u2014 no)\n\nSo king can go to a7, b7, or c7.\n\nSuppose king goes to c7 \u2014 then knight on b6 attacks c8, a8, a4, c4, d5 \u2014 not c7.\n\nSo no immediate mate.\n\nThis line doesn\u2019t win quickly.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **d7f8** again? No \u2014 as before, Black just captures.\n\nHold on \u2014 is there a **discovered attack** or something?\n\nWhat if we move the king to allow the rook to attack?\n\nNo \u2014 too slow.\n\nLet\u2019s look for the most forcing move.\n\nWhat about **d7c5+** \u2014 knight to c5, giving check.\n\nAfter `d7c5+`:\n- Black king on c8 must move \u2014 only legal square is b8.\n- So Black plays `c8b8`.\n\nNow, White has knight on c5 \u2014 which attacks b7, d7, e6, a6, a4, b3 \u2014 not b8.\n\nSo king on b8 is safe \u2014 for now.\n\nNo mate.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **d7e5+**?\n\nSame idea \u2014 king to b8 \u2014 then knight on e5 \u2014 no immediate threat.\n\nHold on \u2014 is there a **smothered mate** possibility?\n\nLet\u2019s try **d7b6+**, then after `c8b8`, play **a1a8+** \u2014 as before.\n\nAfter `a1a8+`, king must go to a7, b7, or c7.\n\nSuppose king goes to b7 \u2014 then knight on b6 delivers mate: **b6c8#** \u2014 no, c8 is empty \u2014 but knight on b6 to c8 is not mate.\n\nWait \u2014 if king is on b7, and knight on b6, then knight can go to a8 or c8 \u2014 not check.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different idea.\n\nWhat if we play **a1a8+** first?\n\nIs that legal? Rook from a1 to a8 \u2014 yes.\n\nAfter `a1a8+`:\n- Black king on c8 must move \u2014 only square is b8.\n- So Black plays `c8b8`.\n\nNow, White has rook on a8 \u2014 and knight on d7.\n\nNow, knight to b6 \u2014 `d7b6+` \u2014 king must move from b8 \u2014 where can it go?\n- a8 \u2014 occupied by rook\n- a7 \u2014 safe?\n- b7 \u2014 safe?\n- c7 \u2014 safe?\n- c8 \u2014 attacked by knight on b6\n\nSo king can go to a7, b7, or c7.\n\nSuppose king goes to b7 \u2014 then knight on b6 attacks a8 (rook), c8, d7, a4, c4, d5 \u2014 not b7.\n\nNo mate.\n\nThis is frustrating.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we play **d7f8** \u2014 not a check, but a threat?\n\nNo \u2014 Black just captures.\n\nHold on \u2014 is there a **zugzwang** or something?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the position again.\n\nBlack king on c8, rook on h8, bishop on g7 \u2014 all",

The key factors to consider:\n1. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on d8\n2. Piece activity: Black's rook on h8 is well-placed, bishop on g7 is active\n3. Material balance: Roughly equal, but White has a knight vs Black's bishop\n\nThe most critical moves appear to be:\n- h8g8 (rook move)\n- d8e8 (king move)\n- c8d7 (bishop move)\n- g7f8 (bishop move)\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n1. h8g8 would be a passive move, moving the rook away from the action\n2. d8e8 would expose the king further\n3. c8d7 would block the bishop's diagonal\n4. g7f8 would be a good move, developing the bishop to a more active square while maintaining pressure\n\nThe best move is g7f8, which:\n- Develops the bishop to a more active square\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n- Doesn't expose the king\n- Keeps all options open for future moves\n\n```\ng7f8\n```",

No \u2014 knight on c8 attacks d6 and e7, but not e8 directly. Wait \u2014 is e8 safe?\n\nHold on \u2014 we must be precise.\n\nBlack king is on **g8**, not d8!  \nI made a critical error.\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate:\n\n**Black king is on g8**, not d8.  \nThe black king is on g8, and the bishop on f8 is on a dark square.\n\nSo, after `b6c8`, what happens?\n\n- Knight moves from b6 to c8 \u2014 this does **not** give check to the king on g8.\n- So it\u2019s just a quiet move \u2014 and Black can respond, e.g., ...Bd6 or ...Rc8, regaining the piece.\n\nThat\u2019s not mate.\n\n### Correction:\nThe king is on g8 \u2014 not d8. So Nxc8 is just a material-winning move, not mate.\n\nBut is it the best?\n\nLet\u2019s look again.\n\n### Realizing the Win:\nThe black king is on g8.  \nWhite\u2019s knight on b6 is attacking c8 \u2014 which is occupied by a black bishop.  \nIf that bishop moves or is captured, then the king has no legal moves \u2014 it\u2019s mated on g8!\n\nWhy?\n- From g8, the king\u2019s escape squares are:\n  - f8: currently occupied by black bishop.\n  - h8: occupied by black rook.\n  - g7: empty.\n  - h7: empty.\n  - f7: empty.\n\nSo the king **does** have legal moves \u2014 g7, h7, f7 \u2014 so not mated yet.\n\nBut if we remove the bishop from f8, then f8 becomes available \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t help.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we **force the bishop to move**?\n\nActually, the key idea is:  \nIf we play **Nxc8**, we win the bishop \u2014 but Black recaptures with the king: Kxc8 \u2014 and now the king is in the center, but not mated.\n\nThat\u2019s just a trade: N vs B, and king ends up on c8 \u2014 which is actually safer for Black.\n\nSo that\u2019s not ideal.\n\n### Better Idea:\nLook at the position again \u2014 the black king is on g8, rook on h8, bishop on f8.  \nWhite has knight on b6 \u2014 it attacks c8, but also **a8**, **d7**, **d5**, etc.\n\nWhat if we play:\n\n**b6d7+** \u2014 knight to d7, giving check!\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n- Knight moves to d7 \u2014 this attacks the black king on g8 via a discovered check? No \u2014 the knight is moving to d7, which is not on the same line as the king.\n\nIs d7 attacking g8? No \u2014 knight on d7 attacks:\n- b6, b8, c5, e5, f6, f8.\n\nAh! **f8** \u2014 the square where the black bishop is!\n\nSo after `b6d7`, the knight lands on d7 and attacks the bishop on f8.\n\nIs it check? No \u2014 the king is not in check.\n\nSo it\u2019s a quiet move \u2014 but a **fork**!\n\nKnight on d7 attacks:\n- f8 (black bishop)\n- b8 (empty)\n- c5, e5, f6 \u2014 all empty\n- and also b6 (but that\u2019s where it came from)\n\nSo it\u2019s a fork: attacks bishop on f8 and also threatens to win material.\n\nBut Black can just move the bishop \u2014 e.g., Bg7 or Be7 \u2014 and no immediate win.\n\n### Best Move:\nLet\u2019s go back.\n\nWhat is the most forcing move?\n\nLook at this:\n\n**a1f1** \u2014 rook to f1.\n\nWhy?  \nBecause now the rook is on the same file as the black king \u2014 and if the bishop on f8 ever moves, it\u2019s a discovered check and mate on f8.\n\nFor example:\n- If Black ever plays ...Bd6 or ...Be7, then Rf1-f8# \u2014 mate!\n\nSo this is a **waiting move with a deadly threat**.\n\nBut is it the best?\n\nWhat about **a1d1**? Same idea \u2014 but d1 doesn\u2019t align with f-file.\n\nNo \u2014 only f1 puts the rook on the f-file.\n\nSo **a1f1** prepares a **mate in 1** if the bishop ever moves.\n\nBut Black can just shuffle the rook on h8 \u2014 Rh8-g8-g8-h8 \u2014 and never move the bishop.\n\nSo it\u2019s not decisive \u2014 just a threat.\n\n### The Real Killer Move:\nLet\u2019s look again at the knight.\n\nWhat if we play:\n\n**b6a8!**\n\nKnight to a8 \u2014 a quiet-looking move.\n\nWhy is this strong?\n\n- a8 is a corner \u2014 but now the knight controls:\n  - b6, c7, c6, b9 (invalid), etc.\n\nMore importantly:  \nAfter `b6a8`, what can Black do?\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on g8, bishop on f8, rook on h8.\n\nIf Black moves the bishop \u2014 say, ...Bd6 \u2014 then **Na8-c7** forks king and rook \u2014 and wins the rook.\n\nIf Black moves the rook \u2014 say, ...Rh7 \u2014 then still no immediate win.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:\n\nAfter **b6a8**, the knight is now on a8 \u2014 and if Black ever moves the bishop from f8, then **Na8-c7+** wins the rook on h8 (because c7 attacks h8 via knight move? No \u2014 c7 doesn\u2019t attack h8).\n\nKnight on c7 attacks:\n- a8, b5, d5, e6, e8, d9 \u2014 not h8.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\n### Final Insight:\nThe only way to force mate is to **remove the bishop from f8** \u2014 because as long as it\u2019s there, the king can\u2019t be mated on g8.\n\nSo the best plan is:\n\n**b6d5!**\n\nKnight to d5 \u2014 central, attacking f6 and e7, but more importantly, it threatens **Nxf8**, winning the bishop \u2014 and after Kxf8, the king is on f8, and now the rook can come in with Rf1 and mate on f8.\n\nBut Black can just move the bishop \u2014 e.g., ...Be7 \u2014 and avoid the fork.\n\nSo still not forced.\n\n### Wait \u2014 the Best Move:\nLet\u2019s go back to the original list of legal moves.\n\nWhat about **g1h2** or other king moves? No \u2014 not useful.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the truth:\n\nThe position is a **zugzwang** for Black \u2014 but only if we do nothing.\n\nWhite can just wait \u2014 but we must make a move.\n\nSo the best move is a **waiting move** that maintains the threat.\n\nThe only move that does that is:\n\n**a1f1**\n\nWhy?\n- It places the rook on the f-file.\n- If Black ever moves the bishop from f8 (to escape the prison), then Rf1-f8# is mate.\n- Black cannot castle or do anything else \u2014 they must eventually move either the bishop or the rook.\n- If they move the rook, we can consider Na8 or Nd7 to increase pressure.\n\nThis is",

Any rook or king move doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the bishop must eventually move or be captured, and either way, mate follows.\n\nThis is a classic **waiting move with a lethal threat**, and it wins cleanly.\n\n```\na1f1\n```",

Black has just moved their king to h8, and White has moved their rook to f1.\n\n### Current Position Summary:\n\n**Black:**\n- King on h8\n- Rook on h8\n- Bishop on f8\n- Bishop on c8\n- Pawns on a7, b7, h7\n\n**White:**\n- King on g1\n- Rook on f1\n- Knight on b6\n- Pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h3\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- Material is roughly equal.\n- Black has a slightly better structure with more active pieces.\n- The knight on b6 is a key piece for White, but it's somewhat isolated.\n- Black's bishops are well-placed, especially the one on c8, which can become very active.\n- The rook on h8 is passive but could be activated via the open file.\n- Black's king is relatively safe on h8 for now.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n- `h8g8` \u2013 Moving the rook to g8, activating it along the back rank.\n- `f8g7` \u2013 Retreating the bishop to g7, possibly preparing to reposition.\n- `f8e7` \u2013 Centralizing the bishop.\n- `f8h6` \u2013 Aiming at the weak h3 pawn.\n- `f8d6` \u2013 Eyeing the center and potentially supporting a pawn break.\n- `f8c5` \u2013 A strong diagonal, eyeing the knight on b6.\n- `f8b4` \u2013 Pressuring the knight on b6 directly.\n- `f8a3` \u2013 Long-range pressure, but less effective here.\n- `d8e8`, `d8e7`, `d8c7` \u2013 King moves, not ideal unless necessary.\n- `c8d7`, `c8e6`, `c8f5`, `c8g4`, `c8h3` \u2013 Bishop repositioning.\n- `a7b6` \u2013 Capturing the knight, which is a major tactical consideration.\n- `h7h6`, `a7a6`, `h7h5`, `a7a5` \u2013 Pawn moves, mostly prophylactic.\n\n### Tactical Consideration:\n\nThe most striking move is **`a7b6`**, capturing the knight on b6. This is a free piece and significantly improves Black's position. Let's evaluate this:\n\n- After `a7b6`, White must respond.\n- If White plays `c2c3`, then Black can play `b6c5`, gaining a tempo and opening lines.\n- The knight was a thorn in Black's position, so removing it is a major gain.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is clearly **`a7b6`** \u2014 capturing the knight on b6. It's a free piece and improves Black's control of the center and long-term prospects.\n\n```\na7b6\n```",

No castling occurred.\n- The light-squared bishop on f8 is hemmed in by pawns on b6 and b7.\n- White has a significant lead in development and space.\n- Black has no immediate threats \u2014 all pieces are passive.\n- White should exploit the exposed Black king immediately.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\nFrom the legal moves list:\n```\ng1h2, g1h1, f1e1, f1d1, f1c1, f1b1, f1a1, h3h4, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4\n```\n\nMost of these are slow pawn moves or king shuffles \u2014 not urgent enough.\n\nBut notice:  \n**f1c1** stands out \u2014 it attacks the Black king directly along the c-file!  \nBlack\u2019s king is on c8, and if the c-file opens, the rook will be devastating.\n\nIs it safe?\n- After `f1c1`, Black must respond. Let\u2019s see:\n  - Black cannot castle or move the king to b7 or d7 \u2014 both are attacked by pawns or unsafe.\n  - The only legal king moves from c8 are to b8 or d8.\n  - If Black plays `Kb8`, then `Rc7` next move wins material or leads to mate.\n  - If Black plays `Kd8`, then `Rc8+` wins the bishop on d8 immediately.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n\n**1. f1c1**  \nNow Black must move the king:\n- 1... Kb8 2. Rc7! \u2014 pins the b7 pawn, threatens mate on a7 or b7, and wins material.\n- 1... Kd8 2. Rc8+ \u2014 wins the bishop on d8 with check.\n\nIn both cases, White wins material decisively \u2014 likely leading to a quick win.\n\nThis is a forcing, aggressive, and correct move \u2014 exploiting the exposed king.\n\n**Other moves like h3h4 or f2f3 are too slow \u2014 they ignore the tactical opportunity.**\n\nThus, the best move is:\n\n```\nf1c1\n```",

But the critical feature is the **exposed Black king on d8**, with no immediate defenders, and **White's rook on c1** already aligned with the open c-file and the Black king.\n\nBlack\u2019s last move must have been ...g7-h8? No \u2014 the move history shows:\n> d7b8, h8g8, b8d7, g8h8, d7b6, g7f8, a1f1, a7b6, f1c1, f8g7\n\nSo this is a repetition loop between b8\u2013d7\u2013b6 and h8\u2013g8\u2013h8, and finally the White rook went to c1, and Black\u2019s bishop returned to g7.\n\nNow, the position is:\n- Black king stuck on d8\n- No Black pieces near the king\n- White rook on c1 \u2014 one square away from delivering a devastating check on c8+!\n- White king on g1 \u2014 safe\n- Black rook on h8 \u2014 passive\n- Black bishop on g7 \u2014 also passive\n\n**Key idea:**\nPlay `c1c8+` \u2014 rook to c8, check, and if Black captures with the king, it\u2019s mate in a few.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n\n**1. Rc8+! Kxc8**\n\nNow Black\u2019s king is on c8 \u2014 exposed, no escape, and no defenders.\n\nWhite has pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h3 \u2014 but no immediate queen or piece to deliver mate.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a forced mate after 1...Kxc8?\n\nNo immediate mate \u2014 but now Black is in huge trouble: king on c8, no castling, no development, and White can bring in the king and pawns to finish.\n\nBut hold on \u2014 is `c1c8` even legal?\n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n- Rook on c1  \n- c8 is empty  \n- Path from c1 to c8 is clear (no pieces on c2\u2013c7)  \n- So yes \u2014 **Rc8+ is a legal and crushing move**\n\nAfter 1. Rc8+ Kxc8, Black has no good plan \u2014 king stuck in center, White can play Kf1\u2013e2\u2013d3, and advance central pawns. Black will be mated or lose material.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a faster win?\n\nWhat about **immediate mate threats**?\n\nNo \u2014 no immediate mate in 1 or 2.\n\nBut Rc8+ wins the rook or leads to a winning king hunt.\n\nAlternative candidate moves:\n- g1h2 \u2014 king to h2? Too slow.\n- h3h4 \u2014 pawn push? Doesn\u2019t threaten anything.\n- c1f1 \u2014 rook to f1? Wastes time.\n- c1e1 \u2014 same.\n\nNo other move compares to **Rc8+** \u2014 it\u2019s a forcing, winning move.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a classic back-rank / seventh-rank rook sacrifice to shatter the king\u2019s safety. After Rc8+ Kxc8, Black\u2019s king is hopelessly exposed in the center, and White will win easily with king centralization and pawn advances.\n\nThis is the best and most decisive move.\n\n```\nc1c8\n```",

Since `c1c8` is **not legal**, and you\u2019ve provided the full list of legal moves, I must have made an error in assessing the position.\n\nLet\u2019s re-analyze carefully using only the legal moves you provided:\n\n**Legal moves (UCI):**  \n`g1h2, g1h1, g1f1, c1f1, c1e1, c1d1, c1b1, c1a1, h3h4, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4`\n\nThis means:\n- The rook on c1 **cannot move to c8** \u2014 so there must be a piece blocking the path!\n- That implies a piece is on c2, c3, ..., c7 \u2014 but in the FEN: `2bk3r/1p4bp/1p6/8/8/7P/PPP2PP1/2R3K1`\n  - c2: \"P\" \u2014 White pawn \u2705\n  - c3: empty \u2705\n  - c4\u2013c7: all empty \u2705\n  - So why is c1c8 illegal?\n\nWait \u2014 the FEN says:  \n`2bk3r/1p4bp/1p6/8/8/7P/PPP2PP1/2R3K1`\n\nLet\u2019s break it down row by row:\n\n- Rank 8: `2bk3r` \u2192 two empty, black king, black bishop, three empty, black rook\n- Rank 7: `1p4bp` \u2192 one empty, black pawn, four empty, black bishop, pawn\n- Rank 6: `1p6` \u2192 one empty, black pawn, six empty\n- Ranks 5\u20134\u20133: all empty\n- Rank 2: `PPP2PP1` \u2192 three pawns, two empty, two pawns, one empty \u2192 a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2\n- Rank 1: `2R3K1` \u2192 two empty, rook, three empty, king, one empty \u2192 rook on c1, king on g1\n\nSo yes \u2014 c2 has a White pawn. That pawn is on c2. So the rook on c1 cannot go to c8 \u2014 it\u2019s blocked by its own pawn on c2.\n\nThat\u2019s why `c1c8` is illegal \u2014 my mistake was not realizing that c2 is occupied.\n\nNow, from the legal moves, we must choose the best one.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the strongest options:\n\n### 1. **c1d1** \u2014 rook to d1\n- Attacks the Black king on d8 directly!\n- If Black plays ...Kc7 or ...Ke7, rook stays active.\n- This is a **very strong candidate** \u2014 immediate pressure on the king.\n\nIs it legal? Yes \u2014 in the list: `c1d1`\n\nWhat happens after:\n**1. Rd1+ Ke7**  \nNow king must move \u2014 can\u2019t stay on d8.\n\nThen White can follow up with Kf1\u2013e2, centralizing king, and preparing to exploit the exposed Black king.\n\nThis is a forcing, active move \u2014 and the only one that gives check.\n\n### Compare to others:\n- `c1e1`, `c1f1` \u2014 less direct, no check\n- `g2g4`, `f2f4` \u2014 premature pawn pushes, no threat\n- `a2a4`, `b2b4` \u2014 irrelevant\n- King moves like `g1h1` \u2014 passive\n\n**Only `c1d1` gives check and forces the Black king to move \u2014 it\u2019s the only forcing move in the list.**\n\nThis is the best and most accurate move \u2014 it exploits the exposed Black king immediately.\n\n```\nc1d1\n```",

Rd4 Bxd4`, Black has no immediate threat.\n     - White can follow up with `Kg1-h2` to connect rooks or prepare g3/g4.\n     - Black\u2019s king remains in the center \u2014 a long-term weakness.\n     - White has a better-structured pawn center and more space.\n\n6. **Other moves (like h3-h4 or c2-c3) ignore the threat and lose material \u2014 illegal in this context.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only move that maintains equality and seizes the initiative is to capture the bishop on d4.\n\n```\nd1d4\n```",

White has a rook on d4, Black has a rook on h8 and a bishop on d7 (just moved there \u2014 see move history).\n- Black\u2019s king is on d8, exposed in the center.\n- White\u2019s king is on g1, relatively safe.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Black just played **...Bd7**, likely to protect the rook on h8 and perhaps prepare ...Rd8 or ...Ke8.\n- White\u2019s rook on d4 is extremely active \u2014 it controls the open d-file.\n- Black\u2019s king is on d8 \u2014 **very vulnerable to a rook check on d7**.\n- The move **d4xd7+** wins the bishop with check and forces the black king to e8.\n- After **1. Rxd7+ Kxd7**, White has a winning endgame: rook + king vs rook + king, with two connected passed pawns on the queenside (b2, c2, a2) and a safer king.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Rxd7+** safe?\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n\n**1. Rxd7+ Kxd7**\n\nNow the position is:\n```\n8/1p4rp/1p6/8/8/7P/PPP2PP1/6K1 b - - 0 34\n```\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on d7 \u2014 exposed, and their rook is on h8, far away.\nWhite\u2019s king is centralized and safe.\nWhite has a **winning king and pawn vs king and rook endgame**, especially with multiple central and queenside pawns.\n\nMoreover, after Rxd7+, Black cannot create counterplay \u2014 their king is too exposed, and the rook is stuck on h8.\n\n### Why not other moves?\n- **d4d6**, **d4d5**, etc. \u2014 passive. Why avoid winning material with check?\n- **h3h4**, **g2g3**, etc. \u2014 slow, give Black time to centralize the king or activate the rook.\n- **King moves** \u2014 unnecessary; the king is safe and should stay near the center in the endgame.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**d4xd7+** is a forced, winning move \u2014 it wins material with check, improves White\u2019s king safety by removing a key defender, and leads to a technically winning endgame.\n\n```\nd4d7\n```",

It also avoids immediate contact with the white rook on d7. However, it doesn't actively challenge the white rook or improve Black's position much.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `d8c8` (King to c8)\n\nThis places the king on the same file as the white rook on d7. It could potentially allow for a future exchange of rooks if White isn't careful. Also, it brings the king closer to the queenside where there are still pawns that can be defended or advanced.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `d8d7` (King to d7)\n\nThis is a **very dangerous** move. It walks into a discovered attack by the white rook on d7. After `d8d7`, White can play `Rxd7+` and win the rook with check.\n\nSo this move loses material immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n\nBetween `d8e8` and `d8c8`, both are reasonable, but `d8c8` is more active and prepares for potential counterplay on the queenside.\n\nThus, the best move is:\n\n```\nd8c8\n```",

But the key feature is the **extremely exposed Black king on c8**, with no pawns or pieces shielding it \u2014 and White has a rook on d7, already deep in Black's position.\n\nLet\u2019s assess threats:\n\n### Immediate Tactical Opportunity:\n- The Black king is on c8.\n- The White rook is on d7 \u2014 one square away from delivering check on d8, directly attacking the king.\n- If White plays **Rd7\u2013d8+**, it's a **check**, and Black must respond.\n  - Black cannot capture the rook (king can't take from c8 to d8 \u2014 it would be moving into check from the rook).\n  - The only legal reply is **Kc8\u2013b7** (moving the king to b7).\n- After **Rd8**, Black\u2019s rook on h8 becomes trapped \u2014 it has no safe squares to defend the b7 square or help the king.\n- Following up with **Rd8xb8+** wins the rook outright, as the king must move again (to a7 or c7), and the rook falls with check.\n\nThis is a forced sequence:\n1. **Rd7\u2013d8+** \u2192 Kb7\n2. **Rd8xb8** \u2192 wins the rook with check\n3. Material advantage becomes overwhelming: Rook + pawns vs. king + pawns \u2014 easily winning.\n\n### Why not other moves?\n- Any other rook move (like Rd7\u2013h7, Rd7\u2013g7, etc.) allows Black time to shuffle the king to safety (e.g., Kb8 or Kb7 without being forced into a losing rook trade).\n- Moving the king or a pawn wastes time \u2014 Black can then consolidate.\n- This is a **winning tactic** that must be taken immediately.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best and only move here is to deliver check and win the rook.\n\n```\nd7d8\n```",

But the key is **activity and king safety**.\n\nWhite king is on g1 \u2014 relatively safe.  \nBlack king is on d8 \u2014 centralized but potentially vulnerable if White can activate the rook or create threats.\n\nWhite\u2019s rook is on a1 (implied by FEN: only rook on back rank, no other pieces).  \nBlack\u2019s rook is on h8 \u2014 passive, not doing much.\n\nWhite\u2019s pawns are mostly on 2nd/3rd rank \u2014 but they have a **potential plan**: advance the h-pawn to h4, then maybe g4, and try to create a passed pawn on the kingside.  \nBlack\u2019s pawns are on b7 and b6 \u2014 potential weakness on c7, but no immediate threat.\n\nWhite\u2019s legal moves:\n- King: g1h2, g1h1, g1f1\n- Pawns: h3h4, g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, g2g4, f2f4, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Black\u2019s king is on d8 \u2014 far from both wings.\n- White can try to create a passed pawn on the kingside \u2014 h-pawn is already on h3, one push to h4 would start the march.\n- If White plays h4, then g4, then h5, etc., and Black\u2019s king is too far to stop it, this could be decisive.\n- Black\u2019s rook on h8 cannot stop it unless the king comes over \u2014 but that takes many moves.\n- White must avoid stalemate or letting Black\u2019s rook become active.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. `h3h4` \u2014 Immediate kingside expansion. Most aggressive and logical.\n2. `g2g4` \u2014 Also prepares h5, but h4 first is better because it doesn\u2019t weaken g3.\n3. King moves \u2014 too passive here. No immediate danger, so no need to move king yet.\n\n**Why h3h4 is best:**\n- It gains space.\n- It prepares h5 and eventually h6, creating a passed pawn.\n- Black cannot stop it \u2014 king is too far away (needs 5+ moves to reach h-file).\n- After h4, if Black does nothing, White can follow up with g4, h5, g5, h6 \u2014 and promote.\n- Black\u2019s rook on h8 is useless unless the king comes \u2014 and by then it\u2019s too late.\n\n**No immediate threats from Black** \u2014 no checks, no counterplay.  \nThis is a perfect moment to push for a win.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPlay `h3h4` \u2014 it starts the winning plan of creating a passed h-pawn while Black\u2019s king is stranded in the center.\n\n```\nh3h4\n```",

But Black has two connected pawns on b7 and b6, while White has a4\u2013c4-type potential but currently only a2\u2013c2.\n- White has a passed h-pawn on h4 \u2014 not yet advanced, but could become dangerous.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Black\u2019s king is exposed on d8, and the rook is on g8 \u2014 potentially vulnerable to back-rank threats.\n- White\u2019s king is on g1 \u2014 safe for now, but not active.\n- The position is **very quiet**, almost endgame-like. No immediate tactics.\n- Black\u2019s pawns on b6 and b7 are not immediately threatening \u2014 they\u2019re blocked by nothing, but White can potentially blockade or attack them.\n- White\u2019s best chance is to **activate the king** and **push the h-pawn** to create a threat.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\nFrom the legal moves list:\n- King moves: `g1h2`, `g1h1`, `g1f1`\n- Pawn moves: `h4h5`, `g2g3`, `f2f3`, `c2c3`, `b2b3`, `a2a3`, `g2g4`, `f2f4`, `c2c4`, `b2b4`, `a2a4`\n\nWe must ask: what is the most pressing plan?\n\n### Strategic Goals:\n1. **Activate the king** \u2014 centralizing or heading toward the queenside to attack Black\u2019s b6/b7 pawns.\n2. **Create a passed pawn** \u2014 either on the kingside (h-pawn) or queenside (if we can fix Black\u2019s pawns).\n3. **Prevent Black from advancing pawns** \u2014 especially if the king becomes active.\n\n### Best Move Candidates:\n- `h4h5` \u2014 advances the h-pawn. Not immediately decisive, but starts creating a threat. If Black ignores it, h5\u2013h6 could become dangerous.\n- `g1f1` or `g1h2` \u2014 king activity. `g1f1` heads toward the center; `g1h2` supports h5 push.\n- `a2a4` or `b2b4` \u2014 try to create queenside play, but Black\u2019s pawns are already on b6/b7 \u2014 pushing b2\u2013b4 might just help Black fix the structure.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate `h4h5`:\n- After `h4h5`, Black must respond. If they ignore it, h5\u2013h6 is coming, and with rook on g8, Black might not be able to stop a promotion.\n- Black\u2019s best reply is likely `Kd8\u2013e7` or `Rg8\u2013g4`, but that would be passive.\n- This move creates a concrete threat and forces Black to react \u2014 **initiative**.\n\nCompare to king moves:\n- `g1f1` is slow \u2014 doesn\u2019t threaten anything immediately.\n- `g1h2` prepares h5, but why not just play h5 now?\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to **create a threat now**. `h4h5` puts immediate pressure on Black, who must now defend against the h-pawn advance. This is a small but meaningful edge \u2014 White should press it.\n\nNo better move offers both activity and a concrete plan.\n\n```\nh4h5\n```",

Black's rook is currently passive on g8\n2. White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed\n3. Black's king is on d8, also somewhat exposed\n4. The h5 pawn is advanced but not immediately threatening\n5. Black has a passed pawn on b6 that could be advanced\n\nBest strategy:\n- Activate the rook to create threats\n- Consider advancing the b-pawn to create a passed pawn\n- Be careful about White's potential pawn advances\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n- Rook moves along the 8th rank (g8h8, g8f8, etc.) don't seem immediately useful\n- d8e8 or d8c8 would move the king, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- h7h6 would advance the h-pawn but doesn't seem urgent\n- b6b5 would advance the passed pawn, which seems most promising\n\nThe most forcing move is b6b5, advancing the passed pawn. This:\n1. Creates a passed pawn that will require White's attention\n2. Opens lines for the rook\n3. Potentially leads to a winning endgame if the pawn can be promoted\n\nOther moves like rook moves don't create immediate threats, and king moves don't improve the position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to advance the passed pawn:\n\n```\nb6b5\n```",

Black has a rook on g8 and a king on d8, while White has a rook on g1 and a king on g1. Black also has pawns on b7 and b5, and White has pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, and h6.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black:\n- `g8h8`, `g8f8`, `g8e8`, `g8g7`, `g8g6`, `g8g5`, `g8g4`, `g8g3`, `g8g2`\n- `d8e8`, `d8c8`, `d8e7`, `d8d7`, `d8c7`\n- `b7b6`, `b5b4`\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n#### King Safety:\n- Both kings are relatively safe, but Black\u2019s king is slightly more centralized.\n- White\u2019s king is on g1, which is a bit passive.\n\n#### Rooks:\n- Black\u2019s rook is on g8, currently not doing much.\n- White\u2019s rook is on g1, also not very active.\n\n#### Pawns:\n- Black has two pawns on the queenside: b7 and b5.\n- White has pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, and h6.\n- The h6 pawn is advanced and could be a threat if supported.\n\n#### Tactical Considerations:\n- Black can try to activate the rook by moving it to a more active file or rank.\n- Moving the rook to the 7th rank (`g8g7`) puts pressure on White\u2019s h6 pawn.\n- Moving the rook to the 6th rank (`g8g6`) also pressures the h6 pawn and supports potential counterplay.\n- Moving the rook to the 5th rank (`g8g5`) is less effective as it doesn't directly threaten anything.\n- Moving the rook to the 4th, 3rd, or 2nd ranks is too far from the action.\n\n#### King Moves:\n- Moving the king (`d8e8`, `d8c8`, etc.) is unnecessary unless preparing for a specific plan, but there's no immediate need.\n\n#### Pawn Moves:\n- `b7b6` or `b5b4` are possible, but they don't create immediate threats.\n\n### Best Plan:\nThe most active and forcing move is to bring the rook into play with **`g8g7`**, putting pressure on White\u2019s advanced h6 pawn. This move forces White to respond, and it gives Black control of the 7th rank.\n\nIf White plays passively, Black can follow up with `Rg7-h7` or `Rg7-g6`, potentially winning the h6 pawn or gaining space.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ng8g7\n```",

Black\u2019s rook is stuck defending g7, and the black king is far away on d8.\n\n### Key observation:\nWhite can **promote the h-pawn** if the rook is lured away or captured.\n\nCurrently, the black rook is on g7, defending the h6 pawn. If White plays **h6xg7**, the rook captures, but then the h-pawn promotes!\n\nLet\u2019s test that:\n\n**Candidate move: `h6g7`**\n\nAfter `h6g7`:\n- If Black plays `Rxg7` (forced, otherwise h7 promotes next move), then White plays `h7h8=Q` and promotes to a queen.\n- Now White has a queen vs. a rook and two pawns \u2014 an easy win.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- After `h6g7`, Black must capture with the rook: `g7xg7` (only move to delay promotion).\n- Then `h7h8q` \u2014 queen promotes.\n- Black is helpless: king is too far, pawns are immobile, rook cannot stop the queen.\n\nNo other move gives White such a clear and immediate win.\n\nOther moves like `g1f1` or pawn shuffles (`a2a3`, `b2b3`, etc.) waste time and allow Black to potentially centralize the king or create counterplay \u2014 unnecessary risk.\n\nThis is a **winning tactic**, not just positional pressure \u2014 it must be taken.\n\n### \u2705 Best move: Promote the pawn by capturing the rook.\n\n```\nh6g7\n```",

Black has a king on d8, and White has a king on g1. Black has pawns on b7, b5, and h7; White has pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, and g7 (which is about to promote).\n\n### Current Turn: Black to move\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `d8e8`, `d8c8`, `d8e7`, `d8d7`, `d8c7`, `h7h6`, `b7b6`, `b5b4`, `h7h5`\n\nWe must choose the best move for Black.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation:\n\nBlack is in a **critical endgame**. The key features:\n\n- **White has a dangerous passed pawn on g7**, one move away from queening.\n- **Black's king is on d8**, far from the action.\n- **Black has a pawn on b5**, which could be advanced.\n- **Black has a pawn on b7**, which can support the b5 pawn or be used to create counterplay.\n- **Black's king is cut off from the kingside**, so it cannot stop the g7 pawn directly.\n\nThe most urgent threat is **g7-g8=Q**, which would give White a decisive advantage unless Black can somehow counter it.\n\nSo, we must ask: **Can Black stop the g7 pawn from promoting?**\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move: `h7h6`\n- This stops the g7 pawn from promoting immediately.\n- After `h7h6`, White must play `g7g8=Q+` (since it's Black's turn), and then Black can respond with `Kd8-e7` or similar.\n- But after `g7g8=Q+`, Black's king is still too far to capture the queen.\n- However, this move **delays** the promotion and gives Black time to bring the king closer.\n\nThis seems like the best practical chance.\n\n---\n\n### Other Moves:\n- `d8e8`, `d8c8`, `d8e7`, `d8d7`, `d8c7`: These all involve moving the king, but none of them reach the kingside in time to stop the pawn.\n- `b7b6`, `b5b4`, `h7h5`: These are pawn moves that don't address the immediate threat of g7-g8=Q.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe only move that **directly addresses the immediate threat** of the g7 pawn promoting is:\n\n```\nh7h6\n```\n\nThis forces White to promote with check (`g7g8=Q+`), but at least it delays the inevitable and gives Black a chance to bring the king over.\n\n---\n\n```\nh7h6\n```",

The most forcing and critical move is:\n\n**g7g8q** \u2014 promoting the pawn to a queen.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate this:\n\nAfter `g7g8q`, the position becomes:\n```\n3k4/1p4QP/7p/1p6/8/8/PPP2PP1/6K1 b - - 0 40\n```\n\nNow Black must move. Their king is on d8, and the only legal moves for Black are with the king or possibly pushing pawns \u2014 but all of Black\u2019s pawns are blocked or immobile:\n- b5 pawn: blocked by nothing, but moving it (b5-b4) doesn\u2019t help\n- b7 pawn: can move to b6\n- h6 pawn: no legal move (h5 is occupied by nothing, but it\u2019s a one-square pawn move \u2014 h6-h5 is possible?)\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s double-check:\n\n- Black\u2019s king on d8: can move to c8, e8, c7, d7, e7 \u2014 but:\n  - c8: empty \u2705\n  - e8: empty \u2705\n  - c7: occupied by b7 pawn \u274c\n  - d7: occupied by nothing \u2014 but that square is empty \u2705\n  - e7: occupied by nothing \u2705\n\nSo king has multiple moves.\n\nBUT \u2014 after `g7g8q`, White has a new queen on g8, which controls the entire 8th rank and the g-file.\n\nLet\u2019s see if Black can survive:\n\nAfter `g7g8q`, Black\u2019s best try might be `d8c7` or `d8e7` to centralize the king, but White can then bring the king up or use the queen to restrict and eventually win the b7 or b5 pawn, and then promote another pawn.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 is there any **checkmate threat**?\n\nNot immediately, but the position is completely winning for White after promotion.\n\nNow, are there any better moves than promoting?\n\nLet\u2019s consider alternatives:\n\n- `g1h1`, `g1h2`, `g1f1` \u2014 king moves: pointless delay\n- Any pawn move like `g2g3`, `f2f3`, etc. \u2014 wastes time; Black can start activating king or pushing pawns\n- Delaying promotion gives Black time to improve \u2014 e.g., king to c7, then b6, etc.\n\n**Therefore, promoting immediately is best.**\n\nIs there any risk in promoting to queen?\n\n- No stalemate: Black king has moves\n- No immediate counter-check or counter-threat\n- Queen on g8 dominates the board\n\nPromoting to anything other than queen (rook, bishop, knight) is strictly worse \u2014 no reason to underpromote here.\n\n### \u2705 Conclusion:\nThe best and most accurate move \u2014 in fact, the only move that maintains the full winning advantage \u2014 is to promote the pawn to a queen.\n\n```\ng7g8q\n```",

It also avoids immediate threats from the white queen along the back rank.\n\n### 2. `d8d7` \u2013 King stays on the same file\nThis keeps the king on the d-file, which may be vulnerable to checks or attacks from the white queen.\n\n### 3. `d8c7` \u2013 King moves to c7\nThis brings the king toward the queenside, but it might be more exposed depending on how White proceeds.\n\n---\n\n## Tactical Consideration:\n\nWhite has a queen on g8 and a king on g1. The white queen can potentially deliver checkmate if Black isn't careful.\n\nBlack's best chance is to keep the king as safe as possible and avoid being forced into a corner or a mating net.\n\nThe most natural and safest square for the king is **e7**, which gives it more mobility and distance from the white queen.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision:\n\n```\nd8e7\n```",

If we play **Qg8\u2013e6**, we threaten mate on e8 or f7.  \nBut better yet \u2014 **Qg8\u2013g7+** immediately checks the black king!\n\nLet\u2019s test that:\n\n**1. Qg8\u2013g7+**  \nCheck on the 7th rank.  \nBlack king must move:  \n- From e7, legal replies are: d6, d8, e8, f8, f6 \u2014 but:\n  - d8? \u2192 Qg7\u2013g8# (mate!)\n  - f8? \u2192 Qg7\u2013g8#\n  - e8? \u2192 Qg7\u2013e7# (discovered check from king on g1? No \u2014 but queen controls e8, f8, g8, so king is trapped)\n  - d6? \u2192 Queen can chase with Qg7\u2013d7+, forcing king further into the corner.\n  - f6? \u2192 Qg7\u2013f7+ wins the h6 pawn and continues mating attack.\n\nSo **Qg7+** forces immediate progress \u2014 it\u2019s a **check**, and it restricts the king severely.\n\nThis is better than any passive queen move (like Qg8\u2013h8 or Qg8\u2013e8), which allow Black to shuffle the king or even (in rare cases) create counterplay with b5-b4 or h6-h5.\n\n### Why not other queen moves?\n- Qg8\u2013e8? King escapes to d6 or f6 \u2014 no immediate win.\n- Qg8\u2013f7+? That\u2019s also a check: Ke7\u2013d6 or Ke7\u2013f6 \u2014 but then king escapes to d6 or f6, and we lose the immediate mating net.\n- Qg8\u2013g6? No check \u2014 lets king go to d6 or f6 freely.\n\nOnly **Qg7+** delivers a check that:\n- Cuts off escape to d8, e8, f8 (they all lead to immediate mate).\n- Forces the king to d6 or f6 \u2014 both of which are losing quickly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBest move is **Qg7+**, which is in the legal moves list as `g8g7`.\n\n```\ng8g7\n```",

Q .\n........\n. p . . . . . p\n........\n........\nP P P . P P P .\n........\n```\n\nBlack is to move. The king is on e7, and the only active piece is the queen on g7. Black has pawns on b7, b5, and h6. White has pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, and h2, and a king on g1.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `e7e8` \u2013 King to e8\n- `e7d8` \u2013 King to d8\n- `e7e6` \u2013 King to e6\n- `e7d6` \u2013 King to d6\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nWhite has a queen on g7, which is currently attacking the black king.

However, it keeps the king centralized and avoids immediate danger. It also prepares for potential king-side activity.\n\n#### 2. `e7d8` \u2013 King to d8  \nThis moves the king toward the queenside. It may help support the b-pawns, but it also moves the king away from the center and closer to the edge, which could be dangerous if White can coordinate an attack.\n\n#### 3. `e7e6` \u2013 King to e6  \nThis brings the king closer to the center and potentially supports future counterplay. It also avoids the back rank and gives the king more mobility.\n\n#### 4. `e7d6` \u2013 King to d6  \nThis is a strong move. It centralizes the king, supports the b5 and b7 pawns, and keeps the king safe from checks along the e-file. It also opens up possibilities for counterplay with the pawns.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n\nThe best move is **`e7d6`**, which centralizes the king, supports the pawns, and avoids immediate threats from the white queen.\n\n```\ne7d6\n```",

The b-pawn chain (b7-b5) is fixed and backward.\n- White\u2019s king is safe on g1.\n- White\u2019s queen on g7 exerts pressure along the 7th rank and can dominate the kingside.\n\n### Goal:\nConvert this winning position **accurately and safely** \u2014 no draws, no stalemates, no counterplay.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nThe queen has many legal moves, but we must find the **most forcing and decisive** one.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most promising options:\n\n#### 1. **g7f6+** \u2014 check!\n- Queen to f6, attacking the king directly.\n- After **1...Ke5**, White can follow up with **Qe7+**, forcing the king back, then slowly centralize and pick up pawns.\n- But is there something faster?\n\n#### 2. **g7d7+** \u2014 check!\n- Queen to d7, hitting the king on d6 directly.\n- Black must play **Kc5** or **Ke5**.\n- After **Kc5**, White can play **Qd3**, cutting off the king and threatening b-pawns.\n- This looks very strong \u2014 centralizing the queen with check and gaining tempi.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n\n**1. Qd7+!**\n- If **1...Ke5**, then **2. Qe7+ Kf5 3. Qd6** \u2014 now the queen controls the key squares, and the b-pawns are helpless.\n- If **1...Kc5**, then **2. Qd3!**, and now:\n  - If Black tries to push a pawn, like b4, White just takes: Qxb5+.\n  - The king is cut off from the queenside, and White can advance pawns or just pick off b5 and b7.\n\nThis move wins a pawn immediately or forces the king into a worse position.\n\n#### Why not g7f8 or g7h8?\n- These are passive \u2014 no check, no pressure. Let the king escape or shuffle.\n\n#### Why not g7g8 or g7h7?\n- Also not forcing \u2014 gives Black time to shuffle king or push pawns.\n\n### Best Move:\n**g7d7** \u2014 Queen to d7 with check. This is precise, forcing, and immediately wins material or dominates the king.\n\nIt avoids any risk of stalemate, doesn\u2019t allow counterplay, and maximizes pressure.\n\n```\ng7d7\n```",

Black has pawns on b5, b7, and h6. The key is that Black's king is currently on d6, and White's queen is on d7 \u2014 this is a **critical proximity**.\n\nWhite's queen is **attacking the b7 pawn**, which is currently defended by the king on d6. If the king moves, the b7 pawn could be lost.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `d6d7` (King to d7)\n- This places the king directly in front of the queen.\n- It removes the king from defending b7.\n- The queen can now capture on b7 with check: `Qxb7+`, and the king must move.\n- After `Qxb7+`, Black's king is forced to move, and White gains a tempo and material.\n\nThis seems **dangerous** for Black.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `d6e5` (King to e5)\n- King moves away from the center.\n- Still defends b7 indirectly via the diagonal.\n- Keeps the king active and central.\n- Avoids immediate threats.\n- May allow Black to reposition for counterplay or defense.\n\nThis looks like a **safe and flexible** move.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `d6c5` (King to c5)\n- King moves toward the queenside.\n- Now **no longer defends b7**.\n- Queen can play `Qxb7`, winning a pawn.\n- After `Qxb7`, Black's king is on c5, and White has a clear advantage.\n\nThis is also **risky**, as it loses the b7 pawn.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`d6e5`**, which keeps the king safe, maintains control over the b7 pawn, and avoids giving White an immediate advantage.\n\n```\nd6e5\n```",

Avoid any stalemate or blunder. The most efficient path is to **checkmate or force resignation**.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nThe queen on d7 has many options. Let's look for **checks** or **zugzwang** that lead to immediate mate.\n\n#### 1. `d7e7+` \u2014 Queen to e7, checking the king\n- Black king must go to d5 or f5\n- After `e5d5`, White can play `e7d7+` \u2014 back and forth? No progress.\n- Not decisive.\n\n#### 2. `d7f5+` \u2014 Check on f5\n- `e5d6` or `e5f6` \u2014 king escapes, no immediate mate.\n\n#### 3. `d7b5+` \u2014 Check on b5\n- `e5d6` again \u2014 king escapes to d6, queen must retreat.\n\n#### 4. `d7c6+` \u2014 Check on c6\n- `e5d4` \u2014 king runs to d4, dangerous for White? No, but no mate.\n\n#### 5. `d7e6+` \u2014 Check on e6\n- `e5f4` \u2014 king runs to f4, now king is active \u2014 risky.\n\n#### 6. **`d7d5` \u2014 Not a check, but a waiting move?**\nNo \u2014 too passive. Black can push pawns.\n\n#### 7. **`d7b7` \u2014 Queen takes the b7 pawn with check!**\n- `d7b7` is a **check**: queen attacks b7, which is occupied by a black pawn \u2014 but that\u2019s a capture with check!\n- Let\u2019s test it:\n  - `d7b7+` \u2192 Black king must move: only legal square is `e5d6`\n  - Now, after `e5d6`, White plays `b7b5+` \u2014 check again!\n    - Black king must go to `d6c7`\n  - Then `b5c5+` \u2014 king to `c7b7`\n  - Then `c5b5+` \u2014 perpetual? No, we can do better.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea:\n\n### \ud83d\udd11 Best Move: `d7e6` \u2014 Not a check, but a devastating **zugzwang threat**!\n\nNo \u2014 that allows `e5f4`.\n\n### \u2705 The Winning Idea:\n**Use the queen to restrict the king and push it toward the edge.**\n\nBut there\u2019s a **forced mate in 3**!\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n**1. d7d5!** \u2014 not a check, but removes escape squares!\n\nWait \u2014 no, that doesn\u2019t help.\n\nHold on \u2014 what about:\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 `d7f5+` \u2014 followed by `f5f6` or similar?\n\nNo \u2014 king escapes.\n\n### \u2705 The Real Killer: `d7c7` \u2014 not a check, but prepares mate!\n\nNo \u2014 too slow.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s try **`d7e7`**, then if `e5d5`, then `e7d7` \u2014 same.\n\nWe need to **cut off the king**.\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Insight:\nThe only way to force mate is to **trap the king on the edge**.\n\nTry this:\n\n**1. d7d8!** \u2014 queen to d8, not a check, but now the king is cut off from the 7th rank.\n\n- If `e5d6`, then `d8d7` \u2014 back to same.\n\nNo \u2014 not decisive.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Let\u2019s Try This:\n**1. d7b5+!** \u2014 Queen checks on b5!\n\n- Black king must go to `e5d6`\n- Now, **2. b5b7!** \u2014 threatening mate on b6 or d7\n\nAfter `e5d6`, play `b5b7` \u2014 now:\n- If `d6c5`, then `b7c7#` \u2014 mate!\n- If `d6c6`, then `b7c8` \u2014 not mate, but queen dominates.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s test:\n\n1. `d7b5+`  \n   - `e5d6`  \n2. `b5b7`  \n   - Now, if `d6c5`, then `b7c7#` \u2014 \u2705 CHECKMATE!  \n   - If `d6c6`, then `b7c8` \u2014 queen controls c8, king can\u2019t escape.\n\nBut is `b7c7#` legal?\n\n- After `d6c5`, queen on b7 moves to c7 \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a check, and the king has no escape:\n  - c5 is attacked by queen\n  - b5 is attacked\n  - c6 is attacked\n  - b6 and d6 are empty but not accessible\n  - No legal moves \u2014 **checkmate!**\n\n### \u2705 Therefore, the best move is:\n**`d7b5+`** \u2014 a forcing check that leads to mate in 2.\n\nWhy not other checks? Because they allow the king to escape into the center or create counterplay.\n\nThis move:\n- Forces the king to d6\n- Then `b5b7` threatens mate\n- Followed by `b7c7#` if king tries to run to c5\n\nNo other move gives such a clean, forced win.\n\n```\nd7b5\n```",

Q . k ...\n........\n........\nPPP..PP.\n...... K.\n```\n\nBlack is to move. The king is in the center, and Black has a pawn on b7 and h6. White has a queen on b5, pawns on b2, c2, f2, g2, and a king on g1.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black:\n- `e5f6`\n- `e5e6`\n- `e5d6`\n- `e5f4`\n- `e5e4`\n- `e5d4`\n\nWe must choose the best move for Black. Let's evaluate each:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5f6`\n- King moves to f6.\n- This places the king closer to the center and potentially supports the h6 pawn.\n- However, it doesn't threaten anything directly and may allow White to improve their queen's position.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5e6`\n- King moves to e6.\n- Centralizes the king slightly more.\n- Still passive; no immediate threats.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5d6`\n- King moves to d6.\n- Brings the king toward the queenside.\n- Could support the b7 pawn or help in a potential counterplay.\n- But still not very active.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5f4`\n- King moves to f4.\n- Very aggressive.\n- Threatens to infiltrate White's position.\n- Could potentially support a future ...h5 push or even a king march to the queenside.\n- Also puts pressure on White's pawns on g2 and f2.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5e4`\n- King moves to e4.\n- Very strong.\n- Central control.\n- Threatens to go to d3 or f3, possibly attacking White's pawns.\n- Also threatens to infiltrate White's position and could lead to a decisive advantage if White isn't careful.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5d4`\n- King moves to d4.\n- Very active.\n- Threatens to go to c3 or e3.\n- Could target White's pawns on c2 and b2.\n- Also opens up possibilities for a king march to the queenside.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Evaluation:\n\nBetween `e5e4` and `e5d4`, both are excellent. But `e5d4` is more aggressive and puts the king in a position to attack White's queenside pawns, which are currently undefended.\n\nWhite's queen is on b5, but it's far from the action on the kingside. If Black can break through with the king, it could lead to a quick win.\n\nThus, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5d4\n```",

Avoid stalemate or perpetual check. Black's king is dangerously close to the center and could potentially be mated or forced into zugzwang.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Black king on d4 is exposed.\n- White queen on b5 controls many squares around the king.\n- Black pawns are on b7 and h6 \u2014 both relatively harmless unless promoted, but they are far from promotion.\n- The white queen must avoid stalemate while tightening the noose.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **candidate moves**:\n\n### 1. **b5b7** \u2014 Queen takes on b7\nThis captures the b7 pawn. Is it safe?\n- After `b5b7`, Black plays `Kd4c5` \u2014 king moves to c5, attacking the queen.\n- Then White must move the queen, and the king escapes toward the center or queenside.\n- This gives Black counterplay \u2014 not ideal. Avoid.\n\n### 2. **b5d5+** \u2014 Check on d5\n- `b5d5+` checks the king directly.\n- Black must respond: `Kd4c3` or `Kd4e4` or `Kd4c4`.\n- If `Kd4c3`, then `Qd5d3+` forces king back to d4 or to b4 \u2014 but then we can continue checking.\n- However, this leads to a series of checks \u2014 not necessarily winning quickly.\n\n### 3. **b5a4+** \u2014 Check on a4\n- `Kd4c3` again \u2014 same issue.\n\n### 4. **b5c6** \u2014 Quiet move, restricting king\n- King on d4 has fewer escape squares.\n- After `b5c6`, king must go to c5, c4, e4, or e5.\n- If `Kd4c4`, then `Qc6c5+` \u2014 check, forcing king to b3 or d3.\n- If `Kd4c5`, then `Qc6b7` \u2014 now queen controls b7 and threatens b2 pawn, but more importantly, cuts off king.\n\nThis is promising \u2014 it\u2019s a **zugzwang-building move**, not a check.\n\n### 5. **b5e8** \u2014 Queen to e8 \u2014 too far away, king escapes to e5 or c5, no pressure.\n\n### Best candidate: **b5c6**\n\nWhy?\n- It doesn\u2019t check, so no risk of stalemate.\n- It restricts the black king\u2019s mobility.\n- It prepares to cut off the king on the queenside.\n- It avoids giving the king free tempi by checking unnecessarily.\n- After `Kd4c4`, White plays `Qc6c5+`, forcing king to b3 or d3 \u2014 then `Qc5b5+` or `Qc5b4` can win the b7 pawn or force king into a corner.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n1. `b5c6` (our move)\n   - If `Kd4c4`, then `Qc6c5+` \u2192 `Kd4` must go to b3 or d3\n     - If `Kc4b3`, then `Qc5b5+` \u2192 `Kb3a2` or `Ka3`\n       - Then `Qb5a5+` or `Qb5a4` \u2014 king gets trapped near a2, and White can bring king in to assist.\n\nThis is a **winning technique**: restrict, then check, then coordinate with king.\n\nOther moves either allow counterplay (like capturing b7) or just shuffle.\n\n\u2705 **Best move: b5c6** \u2014 quiet, precise, and leads to a forced win.\n\n```\nb5c6\n```",

Q .....\n........\n... k ....\n........\nPPP..PP.\n...... K.\n```\n\nBlack is to move.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `d4e5` (King to e5)\n- `b7c6` (Pawn captures on c6)\n- `b7b6` (Pawn advances to b6)\n- `h6h5` (Pawn advances to h5)\n- `b7b5` (Pawn advances to b5)\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation:\n\nWe are in an **endgame** with minimal material. Black has a king and two pawns (on b7 and h6), while White has a king, queen, and three pawns (on b2, c2, f2, g2). The key elements to consider:\n\n- **White's queen is very active**, currently on c6, attacking the b7 pawn.\n- **Black's king is in the center**, on d4, which is dangerous but also potentially useful for counterplay.\n- **Black's pawns are isolated and vulnerable**, especially the b7 pawn.\n- **Black must act quickly** to avoid losing the b7 pawn or being mated.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `d4e5` \u2013 King moves to e5\n\nThis centralizes the king further and gets it off the d-file, away from potential checks. It also prepares to support the h6 pawn or go after White's pawns. This seems like a solid, flexible move.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `b7c6` \u2013 Pawn captures on c6\n\nThis removes the threat of the queen on c6, but it gives White a free tempo to respond. After `bxc6`, White can play `Qxc6`, and now Black has no pawns left except h6. This is likely bad for Black.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `b7b6` \u2013 Pawn advances to b6\n\nThis defends the b7 pawn by creating a shield. However, it weakens the pawn structure and doesn't improve the king's position. Also, White can still play `Qxb6` next move.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `h6h5` \u2013 Pawn advances to h5\n\nThis creates a passed pawn on the kingside, which could be a long-term asset. But it doesn't address the immediate danger to the b7 pawn. White can still take on b7 with tempo.\n\n---\n\n### 5. `b7b5` \u2013 Pawn advances to b5\n\nThis is a **very strong move**. It:\n- **Defends the b7 pawn** indirectly (since the queen cannot take on b5 without losing the queen).\n- **Creates a protected passed pawn** on b5.\n- **Restricts White's queen** from moving to c6 or b6.\n- **Gives Black a long-term plan**: push the b-pawn to promote.\n\nThis move is both defensive and offensive.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\n\nThe best move is **`b7b5`**, as it secures the b7 pawn, creates a protected passed pawn, and limits White's options.\n\n```\nb7b5\n```",

King can go to c5, c4, e4, etc. Too passive.\n\n#### Candidate: `c6d5+` \u2014 Queen to d5, check\n- `Kxd5` \u2192 stalemate! \u274c Avoid.\n\n#### Candidate: `c6xb5+` \u2014 As above, leads to stalemate after `Kxb5`. \u274c\n\n#### Candidate: `c6f6` \u2014 No check, king escapes freely. \u274c\n\nWhat about **`c6d6+`**?\n- `Kxd6` \u2192 again, stalemate! \u274c\n\nSame issue with `c6e6+`, `c6b6+`, etc. \u2014 all lead to stalemate if king captures.\n\nSo we must **not give check that allows the black king to capture the queen**.\n\nWe need to **restrict the king first**, then deliver mate.\n\n### Best Plan:\nUse the queen to cut off escape squares, then bring the king closer to assist in mating.\n\nThe black king is on d4. The ideal mating net would involve:\n- Queen on e3 or e2 (mating on e3 with king support)\n- Or queen on b6, with king on b3 or similar\n\nBut we must avoid stalemate at all costs.\n\n### Strong candidate: `c6e4+` \u2014 Queen to e4, check\n- Black king must move: only legal replies are:\n  - `Kd4-e5`\n  - `Kd4-c5`\n  - `Kd4-c4` \u2014 but c4 is attacked by queen on e4? No \u2014 e4 attacks d5, f5, d3, f3, and files/ranks \u2014 c4 is safe.\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s double-check:\nQueen on e4 attacks:\n- Entire e-file\n- Entire 4th rank\n- So d4 is attacked \u2014 yes, so `Ke5`, `Kc5`, `Kc4`, `Kd3`, `Ke3` \u2014 but `Kd3` and `Ke3` are also on the 3rd rank, not attacked by queen on e4.\n\nHold on \u2014 queen on e4 attacks:\n- All squares on e-file: e1\u2013e8\n- All squares on 4th rank: a4\u2013h4\n\nSo from d4, black king can go to:\n- c5 (diagonal, not attacked)\n- c4 (on 4th rank \u2014 \u2705 attacked by queen!)\n- e5 (diagonal, not attacked)\n- e4 \u2014 illegal, occupied by queen\n- d3 \u2014 on 3rd rank, not attacked by queen\n- c3 \u2014 not attacked\n- e3 \u2014 not attacked\n\nSo legal king moves from d4 after `c6e4+`:\n- `Kc5` \u2705\n- `Ke5` \u2705\n- `Kd3` \u2705\n- `Ke3` \u2705\n- `Kc4` \u274c (on 4th rank \u2014 attacked)\n- `Kd5` \u274c (on d5 \u2014 not on e-file or 4th rank \u2014 wait, d5 is not attacked by queen on e4)\n\nWait \u2014 queen on e4 attacks:\n- e-file: all squares\n- 4th rank: all squares\n\nSo:\n- d4 is on 4th rank \u2014 attacked \u2705\n- c4 \u2014 on 4th rank \u2014 attacked \u2705\n- e4 \u2014 occupied \u2705\n- d5 \u2014 not on e-file or 4th rank \u2014 **not attacked**\n- d3 \u2014 same \u2014 not attacked\n- c5 \u2014 not attacked\n- e5 \u2014 not attacked\n\nSo after `c6e4+`, black king must move to:\n- `Kd3`, `Kd5`, `Kc5`, `Ke5`, `Ke3`\n\nAll of these are legal \u2014 no stalemate.\n\nNow, after any of these, we can bring our king closer and deliver mate soon.\n\nFor example:\n1. `c6e4+`  \n   Suppose `Kd4-e5`  \n2. `g1f2` \u2014 king marches in  \n   Then `Ke5-d5`  \n3. `e4d3` \u2014 queen cuts off \u2014 now king must go to c5 or e5  \n4. `Kf2-e3` \u2014 king supports  \n   Then mate soon with queen on d3 and king on e3 \u2014 e.g., `Qd3-c3#` or similar.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\n### Best move: `c6d5` \u2014 **NOT CHECK!**  \nWait \u2014 `c6d5` is a check! Because d5 is adjacent to d4 \u2014 queen on d5 attacks d4.\n\nSo `c6d5+` leads to `Kxd5` = stalemate \u274c\n\nNo \u2014 we must avoid giving check that allows capture.\n\n### So the best move is: `c6e6` \u2014 queen to e6, not a check.\n\nWhy?\n- It controls the 6th rank \u2014 cuts off king from going to e6/f6/g6\n- It doesn\u2019t give check \u2014 so no stalemate risk\n- Prepares to bring the king in\n\nBut black can still play `Kd4-c4` or `Kd4-e4` \u2014 king becomes active.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n### Best move: `c6b7` \u2014 queen to b7\n\nWhy?\n- Not a check\n- Controls b-file and 7th rank\n- Doesn\u2019t allow king to escape easily\n- Sets up for a mating net on the queenside\n\nStill not forcing.\n\n### Wait \u2014 what about `c6a6`?\n\nQueen to a6 \u2014 controls a6-b6-c6 files, and 6th rank.\n\nStill not forcing.\n\n### Let\u2019s try to force mate now.\n\nThe key idea: **Queen on e3 delivers mate if black king is on d4 and white king is on f2 or f3.**\n\nHow to get there?\n\nWe must:\n1. Remove b5 pawn \u2014 but not by queen capture (stalemate risk)\n2. Bring king to f2 or f3\n3. Place queen on e3\n\nSo first, **move the king closer** \u2014 not the queen.\n\n### Best move: `g1f2` \u2014 king to f2\n\nWhy?\n- Prepares to support queen on e3\n- No stalemate risk\n- King is active\n- Black must move \u2014 king on d4 has many options, but queen can then go to e3 next\n\nAfter `g1f2`, black plays (say) `Kd4-c5`\n\nThen `c6e4` \u2014 now queen controls 4th rank and e-file \u2014 king must go to b4, c4 (illegal), d4 (attacked), b5 (pawn), d5 \u2014 so `Kc5-b4` or `Kc5-d5`\n\nThen `e4e3` \u2014 queen to e3, now if king is on d5, it\u2019s not mate yet \u2014 but king must go to d6 or c5 \u2014 then `Kf2-e3` and mate soon.\n\nThis is promising.\n\nBut is there a faster forced mate?\n\n### Try: `c6e4+` \u2014 as discussed earlier \u2014 it\u2019s a check, but not stalemate-inducing.\n\nAfter `c6e4+`, black must move king to one of:\n- `Kd3`, `Kd5`, `Kc5`, `Ke5`, `Ke3`\n\nSuppose `Kd4-e5`\n\nThen `g1f2` \u2014 king in  \nBlack must move \u2014 say `Ke5-d5`  \nNow `e4d3` \u2014 queen to d3, attacking d5  \nKing must go to c5 or e5  \nSay `Kd5-c5`  \nNow `Kf2-e3` \u2014 king supports  \nQueen to c3: `d3c3#` \u2014 checkmate!\n\nYes!\n\n### So the plan is:\n1. `c6",

The legal moves are:\n- `c5c6`\n- `c5b6`\n- `c5c4`\n- `c5b4`\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nBlack's king is on c5, and White's queen is on e5. Black has a pawn on h6, and White has pawns on the queenside and kingside. Black's king is quite active, but White's queen is also very active and can potentially create threats.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `c5c6`  \nMoves the king to c6. This keeps the king centralized and supports potential counterplay with the h6-pawn. It also avoids immediate danger from the queen.\n\n#### 2. `c5b6`  \nMoves the king to b6. This is a bit more passive and exposes the king to possible queen checks along the 6th rank or diagonals.\n\n#### 3. `c5c4`  \nMoves the king to c4. This is risky \u2014 it brings the king closer to the center but into the range of the queen's control. There could be tactical threats here.\n\n#### 4. `c5b4`  \nMoves the king to b4. This is also risky and places the king on a light square where it might be vulnerable to queen checks and attacks.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\n- `c5c6` is the most natural and safest move. It keeps the king active, avoids immediate danger, and prepares for possible endgame play.\n- The other moves either expose the king unnecessarily or place it in a less useful square.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\nc5c6\n```",

The white queen on e5 is extremely active and central. The black pawn on b5 is isolated and weak. The black king has limited mobility \u2014 only a few squares: b6, c5, c7, d5, d6, d7.\n\n**Goal:** Win quickly and cleanly \u2014 no unnecessary risks. Avoid stalemate or letting the black king reach safety.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most forcing move:\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5b8` \u2014 Queen to b8\nWhy?\n- Checks the black king: b8 attacks c7, which is adjacent to c6.\n- If Black plays Kc6\u2013c7, then Qb8 checks again on c7 \u2014 but wait, that would be check on c7 from b8, yes.\n- But more importantly: **Queen to b8 threatens immediate mate**.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n\n1. **e5b8+**  \n   Black must respond. King has these legal moves from c6:\n   - c5 \u2192 Qb8\u2013b5+ wins the b5 pawn with check, then Qxb5+ Kb7, and queen dominates.\n   - c7 \u2192 Qb8+ forces king to b7 or d7.\n   - d5 \u2192 Qb8 gives check? No \u2014 b8 doesn\u2019t attack d5. So not check.\n   - d6 \u2192 same, not attacked.\n   - b6 \u2192 not attacked by queen on b8.\n\nSo `e5b8` is **not a check** \u2014 b8 does not attack c6. That\u2019s a mistake.\n\nQueen on b8 attacks a7, b7, c7, d7, e8, etc., but **not c6** \u2014 it\u2019s two squares diagonally away.\n\nSo `e5b8` is not a check \u2014 it just threatens to dominate the 7th and 8th ranks.\n\nBetter idea: **Check the king directly**.\n\nLook at:\n- `e5d4` \u2014 not a check\n- `e5d5` \u2014 attacks c6! Yes! d5 is one diagonal square from c6.\n\nTry: **e5d5+**\n\n1. **e5d5+**  \n   King must move:\n   - c7 \u2192 Qd5\u2013d7+ Kb8 or Kb6, then Qxb5+ or Qd8#\n   - b6 \u2192 Qd5xb5+ Ka7, then Qa5+ wins\n   - d6 \u2192 Qd5\u2013d6+ wins the king \u2014 no, king can\u2019t stay in check. So if Kd6, then Qd5\u2013d6# \u2014 **checkmate!**\n\nWait \u2014 if Black plays Kc6\u2013d6 in response to Qe5\u2013d5+, then:\n- Queen on d5 checks king on d6 \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a check.\n- King has no escape: c6 is attacked by queen, e6 is empty but not adjacent to d6? No \u2014 e6 is one square away, but is it occupied? No.\n- From d6, king can go to: c5, c6, c7, d7, e5, e6, e7 \u2014 but:\n  - c5, c6, c7, d7 \u2014 all attacked by queen on d5?\n    - c5: queen on d5 attacks c5 \u2014 yes\n    - c6: yes\n    - c7: yes\n    - d7: yes\n    - e5: queen is on d5 \u2014 so e5 is not attacked\n    - e6: not attacked\n    - e7: not attacked\n\nSo after 1. Qd5+ Kd6, is it checkmate?  \nNo \u2014 king can go to e6 or e7.\n\nSo not mate.\n\nBut still, Qd5+ is very strong \u2014 it forces the king to move, and we can follow up with a winning attack.\n\nBut there\u2019s a better candidate:\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 Best Move: `e5e6+`\n\nWhy?\n- Queen to e6 checks the black king on c6!\n- e6 attacks c6 via the diagonal (e6\u2013d5\u2013c6).\n- After `e5e6+`, Black must move:\n  - Kc6\u2013b6\n  - Kc6\u2013c5\n  - Kc6\u2013c7\n  - Kc6\u2013d5\n  - Kc6\u2013d6 \u2014 but d6 is attacked by queen on e6\n\nLet\u2019s test each:\n\n1. **e5e6+ Kb6**  \n   Then Qe6xb5+ \u2014 check! King must go to a7 or c7.  \n   If Ka7, then Qa5# \u2014 mate!  \n   If Kc7, then Qxb5 \u2014 wins pawn, and king is exposed.\n\n2. **e5e6+ Kc5**  \n   Then Qe6\u2013e5+ \u2014 back to e5, checking again \u2014 Kb4 or Kd4.  \n   Then queen can chase and win.\n\n3. **e5e6+ Kc7**  \n   Then Qe6\u2013e7+ \u2014 forces king to b6 or d6.  \n   If Kb6, Qe7xb5+ Ka7, Qa5#\n\n4. **e5e6+ Kd6**  \n   Then Qe6\u2013d5+ \u2014 check! King must go to c7 or e7.  \n   Then queen continues pressure.\n\nMost importantly: **If Black plays Kb6 after Qe6+, then Qxb5+ followed by Qa5# is forced mate in 3.**\n\nThis is the most decisive line.\n\nCompare to other queen moves \u2014 none offer such a direct and forced win.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n`e5e6+` is the best move \u2014 it checks the king, restricts it, and leads to a forced mate in some lines, or immediate material gain in others. It\u2019s the most accurate and aggressive way to finish the game.\n\n```\ne5e6\n```",

The only legal moves are:\n- `c6c7` (King to c7)\n- `c6b7` (King to b7)\n- `c6c5` (King to c5)\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nWhite has a queen on e6, and Black's king is on c6. White's pawns are on the second rank, and Black has a pawn on b5 and h6. Black's king is in a very precarious position \u2014 it's being pushed by the white queen, and must avoid being checkmated or losing material.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `c6c7` (King to c7)\n- This places the king on the same file as the white queen.\n- White can play `Qe7+`, forcing the king to move again.\n- After `Kd8`, White can continue pressuring with `Qd7+` or `Qe8+`, keeping the king boxed in.\n- This move doesn't improve Black's situation and may lead to a forced sequence that favors White.\n\n#### 2. `c6b7` (King to b7)\n- King moves away from the center and closer to the edge.\n- White can respond with `Qe7+`, forcing the king to a8 or back to b8.\n- This also seems to allow White to control the tempo and restrict Black's king further.\n\n#### 3. `c6c5` (King to c5)\n- This move centralizes the king slightly and avoids immediate checks.\n- It gives Black more flexibility to maneuver.\n- White cannot immediately deliver a check, so Black gains a tempo advantage.\n- This move keeps the king active and avoids being pushed into a corner.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`c6c5`**, as it avoids immediate checks, keeps the king active, and gives Black more room to maneuver in a difficult position.\n\n```\nc6c5\n```",

White is significantly ahead.\n- **Black king is dangerously exposed** on c5 \u2014 it's in the center and vulnerable.\n- **Black's pawns**: b5 is isolated and backward; h6 is harmless unless promoted (but too far).\n- **White's queen on e6** is extremely active \u2014 it controls many central squares and can deliver checkmate with precision.\n- **Immediate tactical opportunity**: Black's king on c5 is only protected by the b5-pawn. If we can remove that pawn or restrict the king, mate is near.\n\n### Goal:\nDeliver **checkmate as quickly as possible**, avoiding any stalemate or blunder that allows counterplay.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWe must look for checks or threats that restrict the black king.\n\nThe most forcing move is:\n**1. Qe6\u2013c8+**  \nWhy?\n- Checks the king on c5: **Qc8+**\n- Forces the king to move: only legal square is **b6** (since a5 is covered by the queen now)\n- After **Kb6**, we can follow up with **Qb7#** \u2014 checkmate!\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n1. **e6c8**  \n   - Black must play **Kb6** (only legal move \u2014 Ka5 is illegal due to Qc8)\n   - Then **Qb7#** is unavoidable: the b5-pawn blocks escape to a6, and king is mated on b6.\n\nIs there a faster mate? Let\u2019s see:\n- Any other queen move that gives check?  \n  - e6d7+? Kb6 \u2014 then queen must retreat or allow Kb5 again \u2014 no immediate mate.\n  - e6d6+? Kb4 \u2014 king escapes toward center \u2014 dangerous.\n  - e6a6+? Kb4 \u2014 again, king escapes.\n  - e6f5+? Kd4 \u2014 king centralizes \u2014 bad.\n  \nOnly **Qc8+** forces the king to b6 and sets up a clean, forced mate in 2.\n\nAlso, no stalemate risk \u2014 Black has the b5 pawn, so even after Kb6, he still has a move (though irrelevant after Qb7#).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis is a **forced mate in 2**:  \n1. Qc8+ Kb6  \n2. Qb7#\n\nNo other move gives such a clean, immediate win. Any other queen move allows the black king to escape or prolongs the game unnecessarily \u2014 and with so few pieces, we must be precise.\n\n```\ne6c8\n```",

The only legal moves are:\n\n- `d6d7` (King to d7)\n- `d6e5` (King to e5)\n- `d6c5` (King to c5)\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nWhite has a queen on d7, and Black's king is in the center. White's king is on g1, and White has pawns on the queenside and kingside.\n\nBlack's king is currently on d6. Let's evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `d6d7` (King to d7)\n- This places the king directly in front of the white queen on d7.\n- It's a **very dangerous** move because it walks into a discovered check if the queen moves.\n- After `d6d7`, White can play `Qd7-d8+` or `Qd7-c7+`, forcing the black king to move again.\n- This move gives White a tempo advantage and doesn't improve Black's position.\n\n#### 2. `d6e5` (King to e5)\n- Centralizes the king slightly more.\n- Keeps the king away from immediate threats.\n- Allows for potential counterplay with the h-pawn (Black has a pawn on h6).\n- Not immediately vulnerable to checks.\n- A solid, flexible move.\n\n#### 3. `d6c5` (King to c5)\n- Brings the king toward the queenside.\n- Could support a possible push of the b5 pawn.\n- However, it also brings the king closer to White's pawns on b2 and c2.\n- Slightly riskier than `Ke5`.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n\nBetween the three, **`d6e5`** is the most natural and safest move. It keeps the king active, avoids immediate danger, and allows for future maneuvering.\n\nIt also avoids walking into a discovered check like `d6d7` would.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\nd6e5\n```",

Avoid stalemate or letting the b-pawn promote.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\nThe queen has many options. Let\u2019s look for checks or threats that restrict the black king.\n\n1. **d7d5+** \u2014 checks the king directly. Let\u2019s analyze:\n   - After `d7d5+`, Black must move: Ke5-f6 or Ke5-f5\n   - If ...Kf6, then Qd5-d6+ forces king back to e5 or to g5 \u2014 but then we can chase it toward the edge.\n   - However, this doesn\u2019t immediately trap the king or win material \u2014 just a check.\n\n2. **d7f5+** \u2014 similar idea, but less central.\n\n3. **d7e7+** \u2014 Ke5-f6, then Qe7-f7+ \u2014 this starts a king hunt toward h8.\n\n4. **d7g7+** \u2014 Ke5-f6, then Qg7-f7+ \u2014 again, pushing king toward h-file.\n\n5. **d7h7** \u2014 not a check, but threatens mate on h5 or h8 if king stays near h6.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s look for a **forcing win**.\n\nWhat if we play:\n\n**d7d5+** \u2014 Ke5-f6  \nThen **d5-f7+** \u2014 Kf6-e5  \nOops \u2014 king returns. Not ideal.\n\nHow about **d7f5+** \u2014 Ke5-e4  \nThen Qf5-f4+ \u2014 Ke4-d5  \nNow queen can dominate \u2014 but still no mate net.\n\nWait \u2014 the best idea is to **restrict the king first**, then deliver mate.\n\nLook at this:\n\n**d7d8!** \u2014 not a check, but prepares Qd8-h8# if the black king is ever on f7 or g7.\n\nBut black can just play ...Kd4 or ...Kf4 \u2014 not immediately decisive.\n\nNow, the most forcing and accurate move:\n\n**d7e7+!**\n\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n\n1. **d7e7+**  \n   Black must play: **Ke5-f6**\n\nNow:\n2. **e7-f7+**  \n   Black must play: **Kf6-g5**\n\nNow:\n3. **f7-g7+**  \n   Black must play: **Kg5-h5**\n\nNow:\n4. **g7-h7+**  \n   Black must play: **Kh5-g4**\n\nNow:\n5. **h7-g6+**  \n   Black must play: **Kg4-f4**\n\nNow:\n6. **g6-f6+**  \n   Kf4-e4  \n7. **f6-e6+** \u2014 Ke4-d4  \n8. **e6-d6+** \u2014 Kd4-c4  \n9. **d6-c6+** \u2014 Kc4-b4  \n10. **c6-b6+** \u2014 Kb4-a4  \n11. **b6-a6+** \u2014 Ka4-b4  \n12. **a6-b6+** \u2014 perpetual? No \u2014 we can do better.\n\nThis is long and unnecessary \u2014 we\u2019re just chasing the king.\n\nBetter idea: **Deliver mate using the edge.**\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n**d7g4!** \u2014 targets h5 square, threatens Qg4-h5# if king is on g5 or h6.\n\nBut after d7g4, Black plays ...Ke5-f5 \u2014 no immediate mate.\n\nWait \u2014 the best move is actually:\n\n**d7d5+!**\n\nBecause:\n1. d7d5+ Ke5-f6  \n2. d5-f7+ Kf6-e5  \n3. f7-e7+ Ke5-f5  \n4. e7-f6+ Kf5-g4  \n5. f6-g6+ Kg4-h5  \n6. g6-h7+ Kh5-g5  \n7. h7-g7+ Kg5-f5  \n8. g7-f7+ \u2014 and we\u2019re looping.\n\nNo progress.\n\nNow, the key realization:\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on e5 \u2014 and the only escape squares are d4, d5, d6, f4, f5, f6.\n\nThe queen can control many of these.\n\n**Best move: d7c7!**\n\nWhy?\n- It doesn\u2019t check \u2014 but it prepares Qc7-c5+ \u2014 which forces the king to d4 or d6.\n- Then we can chase it toward the queenside and use our pawns to restrict it.\n\nBut still not decisive.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s the **winning idea**:\n\nPlay **d7e6+!**\n\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n\n1. **d7e6+**  \n   Black must play: **Ke5-f4**\n\nNow:\n2. **e6-f6+**  \n   Kf4-g4  \n3. **f6-g6+**  \n   Kg4-h5  \n4. **g6-h7+**  \n   Kh5-g5  \n5. **h7-g7+**  \n   Kg5-f5  \n6. **g7-f7+**  \n   Kf5-e5 \u2014 back to start.\n\nNo progress.\n\nNow, the absolute best move \u2014 the one that wins immediately or forces mate:\n\n**d7d8!**\n\nNot a check \u2014 but a **zugzwang preparation**.\n\nAfter 1. Qd8, the black king must move:\n- If ...Ke5-d6 \u2014 then Qd8-d7+ \u2014 Kd6-e6 \u2014 Qd7-e7+ \u2014 Ke6-f5 \u2014 Qe7-f7+ \u2014 Kf5-g5 \u2014 Qf7-g7+ \u2014 Kg5-h5 \u2014 Qg7-h7#  \n  \u2705 **Checkmate!**\n\n- If ...Ke5-f6 \u2014 then Qd8-d7+ \u2014 Kf6-e5 \u2014 back to start \u2014 but we can just repeat and force the king to d6 eventually.\n\n- If ...Ke5-f5 \u2014 Qd8-d7+ \u2014 Kf5-e5 \u2014 same.\n\nSo **d7d8** is a waiting move that forces the king to eventually go to d6 \u2014 and then we deliver mate in 6.\n\nBut is there a faster win?\n\nYes \u2014 **d7e7+** leads to a forced mate in 5 if we calculate correctly.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n1. d7e7+ Ke5-f6  \n2. e7-f7+ Kf6-g5  \n3. f7-g7+ Kg5-h5  \n4. g7-h7+ Kh5-g4  \n5. h7-g6+ Kg4-f4  \n6. g6-f6+ Kf4-e4  \n7. f6-e6+ Ke4-d4  \n8. e6-d6+ Kd4-c4  \n9. d6-c6+ Kc4-b4  \n10. c6-b6+ Kb4-a4  \n11. b6-a6+ Ka4-b4  \n12. a6-b6+ \u2014 draw by repetition!\n\nNo \u2014 this loops.\n\nSo the only way to avoid repetition and force a win is to **restrict the king with the queen and push it to the edge**.\n\nThe best and most accurate move \u2014 the one that avoids any risk of draw and forces mate \u2014 is:\n\n**d7d5+!**\n\nBecause:\n1. d7d5+ Ke5-f6  \n2. d5-f7+ Kf6-e5  \n3. f7-e7+ Ke5-f5  \n4. e7-f6+ Kf5-g4  \n5. f6-g6+ Kg4-h5  \n6. g6-h7+ Kh5-g5  \n7. h7-g7+ Kg5-f5  \n8. g7-f7+ \u2014 and we loop.\n\nStill no progress.\n\nNow, the **only move that wins** \u2014 the one that prevents the king from escaping to the center \u2014 is:\n\n**d7c6!**\n\nWhy?\n- It attacks b5 pawn \u2014 which is undefended.\n- If Black plays ...Ke5-d4, then Qc6-d6+ \u2014 Kd4-e4 \u2014 Qd6-e6+ \u2014 Ke4-f4 \u2014 Qe6-f6+ \u2014 Kf4-g4 \u2014 Qf6-g6+ \u2014 Kg4-h5 \u2014 Qg6-h7#  \n  \u2705 Mate!\n\n- If Black plays ...",

The best way is to push the b-pawn, supported by the king.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the line after `b5b4`:\n\n- `b5b4`  \n- `Qc6xb4` (White takes)  \n- `Kd4` (Black king supports the pawn)  \n- Now Black can try to push h6-h5-h4 and create a second passed pawn.\n\nAlternatively, if White ignores the pawn and plays passively, Black can try to promote.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is to **push the b-pawn** (`b5b4`) and try to create a passed pawn. This gives Black the best practical chances for a draw or even a win if White misplays.\n\n```\nb5b4\n```",

The task is to convert this into a win **without allowing counterplay**.\n\nLet\u2019s look for **forcing moves**, especially checks or threats that restrict the black king.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n- **c6e8+** \u2014 checks the king from e8, but king can go to d6 or f6 \u2014 not decisive.\n- **c6d5+** \u2014 check! King must capture or move.\n  - If 51... Kxd5 \u2014 then White has a discovered attack with the king on g1, but no immediate follow-up. Not ideal \u2014 allows simplification.\n- **c6b5+** \u2014 check! Let's analyze:\n  - 51... Kd4 \u2014 now queen can go to d3+ or a4+ \u2014 very strong!\n  - Or 51... Ke4 \u2014 then Qxb4+ wins the pawn with tempo!\n  - Wait \u2014 is this the key?\n\nLet\u2019s test **c6b5+**:\n\n**1. c6b5+**\n- If **51... Ke4**, then **Qxb4+** \u2014 check, and the b4 pawn falls with tempo. After Kd3 or Kf3, White can centralize and win easily.\n- If **51... Kd6**, then **Qxb4+** again \u2014 now the king must move (Kd5 or Kc6), and White regains the pawn with a winning endgame.\n- If **51... Kf5**, then **Qxb4** \u2014 no check, but still wins the pawn cleanly. Black has no counterplay.\n\nThis move **wins material with tempo** in all cases \u2014 either by check or by threat of check.\n\nOther queen moves like c6e6 or c6d6 don\u2019t win material immediately and allow the king to escape or consolidate.\n\n### Why not c6d5+?\n- 51... Kxd5 \u2014 now White has only king and pawns vs king and two pawns. While likely winning, it unnecessarily simplifies and risks a draw if pawns get too advanced.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**c6b5+** is the best move \u2014 it\u2019s a check that forces the black king to react, and in every reply, White wins the b4 pawn **with tempo**, maintaining the initiative and queen activity.\n\nThis is the most precise and efficient way to convert the advantage.\n\n```\nc6b5\n```",

Q . . k ...\n. p ......\n........\nPPP..PP.\n......K.\n```\n\nBlack is to move.\n\n### Material:\n- White has a queen and pawns.\n- Black has a king and two pawns (on b4 and h6).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The black king is in the center, on e5.\n- The white queen is on b5, attacking the b4 pawn.\n- Black\u2019s only real counterplay is with the b4 pawn, which is currently under attack.\n- If Black moves the king away from defending b4, White can capture it with Qxb4, giving White a decisive material advantage.\n- Black must either:\n  - Defend the b4 pawn (but no pieces can do that),\n  - Or advance the h6 pawn to create a passed pawn and try to promote it.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nLegal moves for Black (king on e5):\n- `e5f6`, `e5e6`, `e5d6`, `e5f4`, `e5e4`, `e5d4`\n\nWe must choose the move that gives Black the best chance to survive or even win.\n\n#### Let's evaluate each move:\n\n1. **e5f6** \u2013 King moves toward the h6 pawn. This supports pushing h6-h5-h4 etc. and creates a potential passed pawn. Good long-term plan.\n2. **e5e6** \u2013 Centralizes king slightly more, but doesn't help much with counterplay.\n3. **e5d6** \u2013 King goes toward the queenside, but there's no real action there.\n4. **e5f4** \u2013 King moves toward the kingside, supporting h6 pawn.\n5. **e5e4** \u2013 King advances, but doesn't help much.\n6. **e5d4** \u2013 King moves toward the queenside, but again, no real action.\n\n### Best Plan:\nBlack needs to push the h6 pawn as quickly as possible to create a passed pawn. The king should support this advance.\n\nBetween `e5f6` and `e5f4`, both support the h6 pawn. However, `e5f6` is better because it keeps the king closer to the center and still supports the h6 pawn while also being ready to march toward g5/f5 if needed.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne5f6\n```",

If we aren't careful, we might accidentally stalemate Black.\n\n### Goal:\nConvert the massive material advantage into a win as efficiently and safely as possible.\n\n### Critical Threats:\n- Black can play ...b3 (next move) and then ...b2, queening soon \u2014 we must stop that.\n- The black king is on f6 \u2014 it's vulnerable to a mating net if we can restrict it.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n1. **Queen moves to threaten mate or restrict king**\n2. **Stop b4-b3** \u2014 ideally by playing c2-c3 or b2-b3\n3. Avoid stalemate \u2014 never leave Black with no legal moves unless it's checkmate.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most forcing and effective move:\n\n#### Option: `b5e8` \u2014 Queen to e8\n- Checks the king: e8 is on the same diagonal as f6 (e8\u2013f7\u2013g6\u2013h5).\n- After `b5e8`, Black must move king: only legal move is `Kf6-g7` (since h6 pawn blocks h7).\n- Then White can follow up with `Qe8-e7+`, forcing king back to f6 \u2014 but this just shuffles.\n\nNot decisive.\n\n#### Option: `b5d5+` \u2014 Check on d5\n- King must go to g6 or g5 \u2014 still not decisive.\n\n#### Option: `b5f5+` \u2014 Queen to f5, check\n- King must go to g7 (g6 is blocked by h6 pawn).\n- Then Qf5-g5+ \u2014 forces king back to f7 or h7 \u2014 again, not leading to mate quickly.\n\n#### Best Plan:\n**Stop the b4 pawn first**, because if Black gets a queen, even with no other pieces, it could be a draw or even a loss if we're careless.\n\nSo, **play `c2c3`** \u2014 this:\n- Stops b4-b3 (now b4 is pinned \u2014 if Black plays b4xc3, then a2-a3 or b2xc3, and we still control the queening square).\n- Keeps queen free to maneuver for mate.\n- Does not risk stalemate.\n- Prepares to support the c3 square if needed.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a faster win?\n\nWhat about **`b5b6+`**?\n- Queen to b6, checking the king on f6.\n- King must go to g5 (f5 is unsafe due to queen, g6 is possible too).\n- Let's calculate:\n\n**After `b5b6+`**:\n- Black king must move: only legal squares are g5 or g6 (f5 is attacked by queen via b6-f2 diagonal? No \u2014 b6 to f2 is not a straight line. Wait \u2014 b6 to f6 is horizontal, not diagonal. So b6 doesn\u2019t attack f5 \u2014 it attacks entire b-file and 6th rank.\n\nSo:\n- `b5b6+` checks king on f6 \u2014 yes, same rank.\n- Black king must go to g5 or g6.\n\nIf `Kf6-g5`, then `Qb6-b5+` \u2014 back to same square \u2014 no progress.\n\nIf `Kf6-g6`, then `Qb6-b7+` \u2014 king must go to h6 or g5 \u2014 but h6 is occupied by pawn.\n\nSo if `Kg6-h6`, then `Qb7-b8+` \u2014 Kh6-h7, and we\u2019re just shuffling again.\n\nNot decisive.\n\n### Best Move:\nWe must **stop the b4 pawn** \u2014 it's the only real threat.\n\nSo, **`c2c3`** is safe, prevents b4-b3, and allows us to then bring the queen in for a mating net.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **checkmate in one or two**?\n\nLet\u2019s look again.\n\nQueen on b5, king on f6, pawn on h6.\n\nWhat if we play **`b5f5+`**?\n- King must go to g7 (g6 is blocked by h6 pawn).\n- Then `Qf5-g5+` \u2014 king must go to h7 (f7 is attacked).\n- Then `Qg5-h5+` \u2014 king must go to g8 or h8.\n- Then `Qh5-h6` \u2014 zugzwang! King must move \u2014 but no legal moves except into check.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s test:\n\n1. `b5f5+` Kg7  \n2. `f5g5+` Kh7  \n3. `g5h5+` Kg8  \n4. `h5h6` \u2014 now Black has no legal moves \u2014 **stalemate!**\n\n\ud83d\udeab Stalemate \u2014 draw! We must avoid this.\n\nSo that plan fails.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe safest and most accurate move is to **stop the b-pawn first**, then win with the queen.\n\n\u2705 Play `c2c3` \u2014 prevents b4-b3, keeps all options open, no risk of stalemate, and allows us to then bring the queen in to deliver mate.\n\n```\nc2c3\n```",

Let's evaluate the position:\n\n---\n\n### Material:\n- Both sides have equal material: 1 queen, 2 pawns each.\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4, which is advanced and dangerous.\n- White has a queen on b5, which is active and can support the queenside pawns or attack the black king.\n\n---\n\n### King Safety:\n- Black king is in the center but relatively safe for now.\n- White king is on g1, also not immediately threatened.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n- `f6g7`, `f6f7`, `f6e7`, `f6g6`, `f6e6` \u2013 all king moves\n- `b4c3` \u2013 capturing on c3\n- `h6h5` \u2013 advancing the h-pawn\n- `b4b3` \u2013 pushing the b-pawn\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n\n#### 1. `b4c3` \u2013 Capturing on c3\nThis removes a central pawn and opens up the c-file. It also gives Black a potential passed pawn after `...bxc3`. However, it may allow White to activate their queen more effectively.\n\n#### 2. `b4b3` \u2013 Pushing the b-pawn\nThis is a strong candidate. It creates a dangerous passed pawn and threatens to promote. White will have to respond carefully.\n\n#### 3. `f6g7` \u2013 King to g7\nThis centralizes the king slightly and prepares to support the h-pawn or defend against threats from the white queen.\n\n#### 4. `f6e6` \u2013 King to e6\nCentralizing the king further, possibly preparing to support the b-pawn or control key squares.\n\n#### 5. `h6h5` \u2013 Advancing the h-pawn\nThis is a waiting move. It doesn't achieve much immediately and could be used if Black wants to create a second front.\n\n---\n\n### Best Plan:\nBlack should aim to push the **b-pawn** as quickly as possible to create a passed pawn and force White to deal with it. The move `b4b3` is the most direct and effective way to do this.\n\nAfter `b4b3`, White must respond. If White plays passively, Black can follow up with `b3-b2` and promote.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nb4b3\n```",

White is to move.\n\n### Material:\n- White: Queen (b5), pawns on a2, b2, c3, f2, g2, h2, King on g1\n- Black: King on f6, pawn on h6, pawn on b3\n\nBlack has two connected passed pawns \u2014 the b3-pawn is especially dangerous, one square from queening. The Black king is on f6, and the White queen is on b5, currently **attacking the b3-pawn**.\n\nIf White does nothing, Black plays ...b2 and queens next move.\n\nSo, **White must prevent ...b2**.\n\n### Key Threat:\n- If it were Black to move: ...b2! followed by ...b1=Q, and Black wins.\n\nSo, White must **capture or block the b3-pawn immediately** \u2014 or else lose.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nOnly one move prevents immediate loss:\n\n- **b5xb3** \u2014 capture the b3-pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n- After `b5b3`, Black must move the king (no other legal move). The king on f6 can go to:\n  - f5, g5, e5, e6, g6, or h5 (but h5 is unsafe due to queen control)\n\nAfter `b5b3`, Black plays `Kf6-e5` or similar, but now White has:\n- Queen on b3\n- King on g1\n- Pawns on a2, b2, c3, etc.\n\nWhite now has time to centralize the king and support the queenside pawns. Most importantly, the immediate threat of promotion is gone.\n\nAny other move allows Black to play `b2` with unstoppable promotion.\n\nFor example:\n- If White plays `g1f1` or any king move \u2014 Black plays `b2`, then `b1=Q`, and wins.\n- If White plays `c3c4` \u2014 Black plays `b2`, same result.\n\nSo, **only b5b3 is winning or even drawing** \u2014 all other moves lose immediately.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhite must capture on b3 to stop the pawn from queening.\n\n```\nb5b3\n```",

The key elements of the position:\n\n- **Material**: Black has a king and a pawn on h6. White has a king, a queen, two pawns on b2 and a2, and a pawn on g2.\n- **White's threats**: White's queen is active and can potentially support a pawn promotion if Black isn't careful.\n- **Black's plan**: Black must try to promote the h-pawn or at least create a passed pawn that White cannot stop. However, with only a king and a pawn, Black must be extremely precise.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `f6g7` \u2013 King moves to g7\n- `f6e7` \u2013 King moves to e7\n- `f6g6` \u2013 King moves to g6\n- `f6g5` \u2013 King moves to g5\n- `f6f5` \u2013 King moves to f5\n- `f6e5` \u2013 King moves to e5\n- `h6h5` \u2013 Pawn advances\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n#### Move: `h6h5`\nThis is the most aggressive and logical move. It pushes the h-pawn forward, aiming to create a passed pawn. If Black can push this pawn to h4, h3, and then promote it, it could be decisive.\n\nWhite will likely respond by trying to stop the pawn with the queen or king. But Black's king is well-placed to support the pawn's advance.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some lines:\n\n- After `h6h5`, White may play `Qb3` to attack the pawn.\n- Then Black can play `Kf5` or `Ke5` to support the pawn.\n- If White tries to bring the king over, Black can continue pushing the pawn.\n\nThis is the best chance for Black to create counterplay and possibly win.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is to push the h-pawn and start creating a passed pawn.\n\n```\nh6h5\n```",

Black has only a king and a pawn on h5 \u2014 which is currently blocked and not an immediate threat.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite must **checkmate** or at least **prevent any stalemate or perpetual draw**. The key danger here is accidentally stalemating Black if the king is cornered without any legal moves.\n\nBlack\u2019s only pawn is on h5 \u2014 not a threat unless White blunders by allowing it to advance.\n\n### Current Threats:\n- None from Black \u2014 no checks, no pawn promotion imminent.\n- White must **not stalemate** \u2014 must keep Black with legal moves until checkmate.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWhite\u2019s queen on c3 has many options. Let\u2019s evaluate the most forcing and precise ones.\n\n#### Key Idea:\nWe want to **restrict the Black king** and **march it toward the edge** for a checkmate. The king is on f6 \u2014 central but vulnerable.\n\nThe best plan is to use the queen to **cut off escape squares** and **drive the king toward the h-file or 8th rank**, where mate can be delivered with the queen and king support.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the most effective queen move:\n\n- **b3g8?** \u2014 Too far, no immediate threat.\n- **b3b8?** \u2014 Same, too passive.\n- **b3f7+?** \u2014 This is **CHECK**! King must move from f6.\n\nLet\u2019s test **b3f7** (Queen from c3 to f7 \u2014 UCI: `c3f7`):\n\n- **c3f7**: Queen moves to f7, giving check: **Kf6-e5** or **Kf6-g5**\n  - If **Ke5**, then queen can follow with Qe7+, forcing king back toward center or edge.\n  - If **Kg5**, then White can play g3 or g4 to restrict h-pawn, and queen can control h-file.\n\nThis is **forcing**, **prevents stalemate**, and **initiates a king hunt**.\n\nOther queen moves like b6, b5, c4, etc., are slow \u2014 they allow the king to shuffle between f6\u2013e5\u2013e6 without progress.\n\n### Why c3f7 is best:\n- It\u2019s a **check**, so Black must respond \u2014 no waiting moves.\n- It **controls e6 and g6**, limiting king mobility.\n- After Ke5, we can play Qe7+, forcing king to d4 or d5 \u2014 then bring the king in to assist.\n- Prevents any chance of stalemate by keeping the king active.\n\n### Final Decision:\nPlay the check: **Queen c3 \u2192 f7**\n\n```\nc3f7\n```",

That means the queen is **not on c3**, but on **b3**!\n\nLet me re-analyze the FEN:\n\n**FEN:** `8/8/5k2/7p/8/1QP5/PP3PP1/6K1 w - - 0 54`\n\n- `/1QP5/` on the 3rd rank \u2014 that\u2019s **file b3 = Queen**, file c3 = Pawn.\n\n\u2705 So:\n- **Queen is on b3**, not c3 \u2014 my earlier mistake!\n- Pawn is on c3\n- So the legal queen moves are all from b3 \u2014 which matches the move list: `b3g8`, `b3f7`, etc.\n\nNow, from the legal moves, we must pick the **best one**.\n\nWe want to avoid stalemate, force the king toward the edge, and deliver checkmate efficiently.\n\nLet\u2019s test the most forcing legal move:\n\n### Candidate: `b3f7` \u2014 Queen from b3 to f7 \u2014 **CHECK!**\n- King on f6 must move: only legal squares are **e5** or **g5**\n  - If **Ke5**, then Qe7+ forces king toward center or queenside \u2014 winnable.\n  - If **Kg5**, then White can play g3 or g4 to restrict h5 pawn, and queen controls h-file.\n\nThis is **still the best move**: it\u2019s a check, forces the king to move, and begins the mating net.\n\nBut earlier I was told `c3f7` was illegal \u2014 now I see: the queen is on **b3**, so `b3f7` **must be legal** \u2014 and it **is** in the legal move list you gave.\n\nSo the correct UCI move is:\n\n```\nb3f7\n```",

Black has a pawn on h5, and White has pawns on c3, b2, a2, f2, g2. The kings are on opposite sides of the board.\n\n### Move History:\n- d6e5 (Black king to e5)\n- d7c6 (Black king to c6)\n- b5b4 (White pawn to b4)\n- c6b5 (Black king to b5)\n- e5f6 (Black king to f6)\n- c2c3 (White pawn to c3)\n- b4b3 (White pawn to b3)\n- b5b3 (Black king captures on b3)\n- h6h5 (White pawn to h5)\n- b3f7 (Black king to f7)\n\nNow it's Black's turn.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `f6f7` (King from f6 to f7)\n- `f6g5` (King from f6 to g5)\n- `f6e5` (King from f6 to e5)\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation:\n\nWe must choose the best move for Black. Let's evaluate each:\n\n### 1. `f6f7` (King to f7)\nThis places the Black king directly in front of the White queen on f7. This is a **very dangerous** move because the queen can now deliver checkmate or force a quick loss if not handled precisely.\n\nAfter `f6f7`, White plays `Qxf7+` and wins the king \u2014 this is **illegal**, but more importantly, it leads to an immediate blunder by Black.\n\nSo this move is **not safe** and **not advisable**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `f6g5` (King to g5)\nThis move brings the king closer to the center and potentially toward the h5 pawn. It also avoids immediate danger from the queen.\n\nWhite may respond with `Qf5+`, forcing the king to move again. But this gives Black flexibility and avoids immediate threats.\n\nThis seems like a **safe and active** move.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `f6e5` (King to e5)\nThis centralizes the king and opens up possibilities for maneuvering. It also avoids immediate queen checks.\n\nWhite could respond with `Qe7+`, forcing the king to move again. However, this keeps the game going without exposing the king to immediate danger.\n\nThis is also a **solid and flexible** move.\n\n---\n\n## Comparison:\n\n- `f6f7` is **dangerous** and likely leads to a quick loss.\n- `f6g5` and `f6e5` are both **safe** and **active**.\n- Between them, `f6g5` is slightly more **proactive**, as it heads toward the h5 pawn and may allow Black to create counterplay.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision:\n\nThe best move is:\n\n```\nf6g5\n```",

No other pieces.\n- The black king is dangerously advanced, but White has a queen and a full set of pawns.\n\nCurrent position:\n- White's queen is on f7, attacking along the 7th rank and eyeing the black king.\n- Black king on g5, pawn on h5 \u2014 very limited mobility.\n- White's king is on g1, safe for now.\n- White has a protected passed pawn on c3, but that's not immediately relevant.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite is **winning easily** \u2014 up a queen for nothing. The task is to **convert efficiently and safely**, avoiding stalemate or king escapes.\n\n### Critical Observation:\nBlack\u2019s only pawn is on h5 \u2014 it cannot queen without help. Black\u2019s king is on g5 \u2014 very exposed.\n\nWhite\u2019s queen on f7 can deliver checkmate or force the king into zugzwang.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **candidate moves**:\n\n#### 1. **Check moves**:\n- `f7g7+` \u2192 Kg4 \u2014 then Qg6+, forcing king back to h4 or h5, but might not be fastest.\n- `f7h5+` \u2192 Kxh5 \u2014 then White has only pawns left, and must queen one \u2014 possible, but unnecessarily long.\n- `f7g6+` \u2192 Kh4 \u2014 then Qg7, threatening mate on h6 or g6 \u2014 promising.\n- `f7f5+` \u2192 Kh4 \u2014 then Qf4+ forces king back to g5 \u2014 not decisive.\n\n#### 2. **Forcing mate**:\nLook for a **checkmate pattern**. The black king is on g5 \u2014 it has only h5, h4, f5, f4, and g4 as escape squares \u2014 but most are blocked or controllable.\n\nWhat if we play:\n**`f7g7`** \u2014 not a check, but prepares mate.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea:\n\n**`f7h5+`** \u2014 forces capture: `...Kxh5`, then White has no queen, but a king + pawns vs lone king. Winnable, but slow and unnecessary risk (e.g., if king runs to h8 and White doesn\u2019t know how to queen a pawn).\n\nBetter: **Avoid exchanging queens unless forced.**\n\nWhat about:\n**`f7g6+`**  \n- If `...Kh4`, then `Qg7` \u2014 now Kh3 is illegal (no square), and if Kh5, then Qh7#  \n- If `...Kh6`, then Qg8 \u2014 zugzwang! King must go to h5 or g5, then Qh7# or Qg6#\n\nLet\u2019s test this:\n\n**1. f7g6+ Kh4**  \n**2. Qg7!**  \nNow:\n- If `...Kh3`, then Qh6# \u2014 mate!\n- If `...Kh5`, then Qh7# \u2014 mate!\n- If `...Kh4` again, repeat \u2014 but Black must move.\n\nSo this is a forced mate in 2 or 3.\n\nIs there a faster mate?\n\nWhat about:\n**`f7h7`** \u2014 not a check. King on g5 \u2014 not immediately threatening.\n\n**`f7g8`** \u2014 queen to g8 \u2014 then Qg7+ forces king to h4 or h6 \u2014 then mate next move.\n\nBut `f7g6+` is direct and forces immediate zugzwang.\n\n### Best Move:\n**`f7g6+`** \u2014 this is a **check**, forces the black king to h4 or h6, and leads to immediate mate in 1 or 2.\n\nAfter:\n- `...Kh4` \u2192 `Qg7` \u2192 mate next move (Qh6# or Qh7# depending on king move)\n- `...Kh6` \u2192 `Qg8` \u2192 now Black must move to g5 or h5 \u2014 both lead to Qh7#\n\nThis is the most efficient and safest path to mate \u2014 no risk of stalemate, no unnecessary exchanges.\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n```\nf7g6\n```",

The only legal moves are:\n- `g5g6` (King moves to g6)\n- `g5h4` (King moves to h4)\n- `g5f4` (King moves to f4)\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nWhite has a queen on g6, and Black's king is on g5. White's king is on g1, and there are pawns on both sides. Black's king is in a very dangerous position \u2014 it's exposed and under threat from the white queen.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `g5g6` (King to g6)\nThis places the black king directly in front of the white queen. It's a **very dangerous** move because the queen can now deliver checkmate with `Qg6+` followed by `Qg7#` or similar if the king is not careful.\n\nSo this move is **not safe**.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. `g5h4` (King to h4)\nThis moves the king away from the center and closer to the edge. It avoids immediate danger but gives White more time to coordinate an attack. Still, it's not ideal as it doesn't improve Black's position.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. `g5f4` (King to f4)\nThis is the **best move**. It centralizes the king slightly and gets it out of the line of fire from the white queen. It also opens up potential counterplay for Black by possibly threatening to infiltrate White's position or support a pawn break.\n\nMost importantly, it avoids immediate checkmate threats and keeps the game alive.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is **`g5f4`**, which improves the king's safety and gives Black the best chance to resist or even counterattack.\n\n```\ng5f4\n```",

Black\u2019s king is dangerously exposed on f4, and the h5 pawn is isolated and cannot queen without help (which it doesn\u2019t have).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Black king on f4 has very few escape squares: e5, e3, g3, g5, e4, g4 \u2014 but many are covered by the queen.\n- The white queen on g6 already controls g-file and can deliver mate in one or two moves.\n- Immediate mate threats exist.\n\nLet\u2019s look for **checkmating patterns**.\n\n### Candidate Move: `g6g8`\n- Queen moves to g8.  \n  Now, queen controls the 8th rank and the g-file.  \n  Black king on f4 \u2014 is it in check? No.  \n  But now, after `g6g8`, what can Black do?  \n  Black has no pieces except the king. Any king move must be to e5, e3, g3, g5, e4, or g4.\n\nLet\u2019s test if this leads to forced mate:\n\nAfter `g6g8`, Black must move the king. Suppose:\n- `...Kg5` \u2014 then `Qg7#` (queen to g7, mate)\n- `...Kg3` \u2014 then `Qg7#` again\n- `...Ke5` \u2014 then `Qd5#`\n- `...Ke3` \u2014 then `Qg3#`\n- `...Ke4` \u2014 then `Qg4#`\n- `...Kg4` \u2014 then `Qg6#` \u2014 wait, that square is vacated!\n\nWait \u2014 is `g6g8` actually the best?\n\nHold on \u2014 what about **immediate mate**?\n\nCheck if any queen move delivers mate **right now**.\n\nTry:\n- `g6g5+` \u2014 checks the king on f4.  \n  King must go to g3 or g4 or e5 or e3 or e4.  \n  Not mate.\n\n- `g6f6+` \u2014 same idea, not mate.\n\nWhat about `g6h5`? That captures the pawn \u2014 but not check. King can go to g5 \u2014 then queen can\u2019t immediately mate.\n\nNow, try **`g6g4#`** \u2014 is that checkmate?\n\nQueen to g4:  \n- Checks the king on f4 \u2014 yes.  \n- Is king in check? Yes.  \n- Can king escape?  \n  - e5 \u2014 not attacked by anything except queen? No \u2014 queen on g4 doesn\u2019t attack e5.  \n    So king escapes to e5 \u2014 not mate.\n\nWait \u2014 what about `g6e6+`?  \nQueen to e6 \u2014 checks f4.  \nKing can go to e4 or g4 \u2014 not mate.\n\nHold on \u2014 is there a **stalemate risk**?  \nNo \u2014 Black king has moves, and we must avoid giving stalemate by accident.\n\n### Best idea: **Force the king to the edge and deliver mate**\n\nThe most forcing and safest path to mate is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **`g6g8`** \u2014 not check, but restricts the king and sets up immediate mate next move no matter what Black does.\n\nAfter `g6g8`, as analyzed:\n- If `Kg5` \u2192 `Qg7#`\n- If `Kg3` \u2192 `Qg7#`\n- If `Ke5` \u2192 `Qd5#`\n- If `Ke3` \u2192 `Qg3#`\n- If `Ke4` \u2192 `Qg4#`\n- If `Kg4` \u2192 `Qg6#` \u2014 but wait, queen just left g6 \u2014 so g6 is empty. Can we do that?\n\nWait \u2014 after `g6g8`, queen is on g8.  \nIf Black plays `Kg4`, then queen can go to g6 \u2014 but is that checkmate?\n\nKing on g4, queen on g6 \u2014 does that deliver mate?\n\n- King on g4\n- Queen on g6 \u2014 attacks g4? Yes.\n- Escape squares: h4 (no), h5 (pawn), f4 (attacked), f5 (not attacked), h3 (no), f3 (no) \u2014 wait:\n\nKing on g4:\n- h4 \u2014 empty? Yes \u2014 h4 is empty! So king escapes to h4 \u2014 **not mate**.\n\nSo `Qg6` after `Kg4` is NOT mate \u2014 king escapes to h4.\n\nSo `g6g8` is not the best \u2014 because it allows `Kg4` and then `Kh4`, and we have to chase again.\n\nWe must find a move that either:\n- Delivers immediate mate, or\n- Forces king to a square where mate is unavoidable next move, with no escape.\n\n### Try `g6h6` \u2014 queen to h6\n\n- Checks king on f4? No \u2014 h6 doesn\u2019t attack f4.\nNot useful.\n\n### Try `g6f6` \u2014 queen to f6\n\n- Checks king on f4 \u2014 yes.\n- King must move:\n  - e3 \u2014 then Qf3#\n  - e4 \u2014 then Qf4# \u2014 wait, queen is already on f6 \u2014 can\u2019t go to f4\n  - g3 \u2014 then Qf3#\n  - g4 \u2014 then Qf4# \u2014 again, queen on f6 can\u2019t go to f4\n  - e5 \u2014 then Qf5#\n\nWait \u2014 after `g6f6+`, king must move. Suppose:\n- `...Kg4` \u2014 then queen can go to f4 \u2014 but that\u2019s not possible now \u2014 queen is on f6, and f4 is occupied by the black king.\n\nSo after `g6f6+`, if `...Kg4`, then queen can play `f6g6` or `f6h6` \u2014 but not mate.\n\nThis is messy.\n\n### The best move: `g6g5+`\n\nQueen to g5 \u2014 checks the king on f4.\n\nBlack king must move:\n- e3 \u2014 then Qg3#\n- e4 \u2014 then Qg4#\n- g3 \u2014 then Qg3# \u2014 wait, same square\n- g4 \u2014 then Qg6# \u2014 because king on g4, queen on g6 \u2014 but g6 is empty \u2014 yes!\n- e5 \u2014 then Qg7# or Qg6# \u2014 wait, king on e5, queen on g5 \u2014 not mate yet.\n\nLet\u2019s test each:\n\nAfter `g6g5+`:\n1. `...Ke3` \u2192 `Qg3#` \u2705\n2. `...Kg3` \u2192 `Qg3#` \u2705\n3. `...Ke4` \u2192 `Qg4#` \u2705\n4. `...Kg4` \u2192 `Qg6#` \u2705 (queen moves to g6 \u2014 king has no escape: h4? h4 is empty \u2014 wait again!)\n\nHold on \u2014 if king is on g4, and queen moves to g6, is h4 available?\n\nYes \u2014 h4 is empty. So king escapes to h4 \u2014 **not mate**.\n\nSo again, `g6g5+` followed by `Qg6` is not mate \u2014 king escapes to h4.\n\nWe must **eliminate h4 as an escape square**.\n\nHow?\n\nThe only way to prevent h4 as an escape is to **control it** \u2014 but we can\u2019t with current pieces.\n\nSo perhaps the best plan is to **force the king to the 3rd or 5th rank**, where h4 is not an option.\n\n### The correct idea: **`g6e6+`**\n\nQueen to e6 \u2014 checks king on f4.\n\nKing must move:\n- e4 \u2014 then Qe4# \u2014 wait, queen can\u2019t go to e4 \u2014 it\u2019s occupied by the king.\n- e5 \u2014 then Qe5# \u2014 same issue.\n- g4 \u2014 then Qg6# \u2014 again, h4 escape.\n- g3 \u2014 then Qg3# \u2014 but h3 is free \u2014 king escapes to h3.\n\nNo \u2014 same problem.\n\n### Insight: The only way to guarantee mate is to **trap the king on the edge** \u2014 ideally on h-file or g-file.\n\nThe best move is actually:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **`g6h7`** \u2014 no, that\u2019s away from the action.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **`g6g7`**?\n\nQueen to g7 \u2014 not check.  \nKing on f4 \u2014 now what?\n\n- If `...Kg5` \u2192 `Qh7#` \u2014 but h7 is empty, and king can go to h5 \u2014 no, h5 has a pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 h5 has a black pawn. So if king goes to g5, then `Qh7#` \u2014 is that mate?\n\nKing on g5, queen on h7:\n- h6 \u2014 empty",

Black's king is quite active, and White has a queen and pawns on the kingside. The position is extremely sharp.\n\n### Current Turn: Black to move\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `f4f5`\n- `f4e4`\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate both options.\n\n---\n\n### Option 1: `f4f5`\n\nThis move advances the pawn forward, potentially creating a passed pawn or opening lines for the king. It also restricts the white queen's mobility slightly.\n\nAfter `f4f5`, the pawn is on f5, and the black king is on f4. This could lead to a dangerous opposition setup if White's queen tries to approach.\n\nHowever, it might allow White to play `Qg4+` or `Qe3`, trying to harass the black king.\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: `f4e4`\n\nThis centralizes the king further and keeps it more protected. It also opens up the possibility of using the king actively in the center or on the queenside.\n\nAfter `f4e4`, the black king is now on e4, which is a strong central square. It can support any future pawn breaks and is less exposed than on f4.\n\nWhite may respond with `Qe3+` or `Qg4+`, but the king on e4 is better placed to handle such checks.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- `f4f5` is aggressive but risks exposing the king.\n- `f4e4` is safer and more flexible, keeping the king centralized and ready to influence both wings.\n\nGiven the critical nature of the match and the need to avoid any counterplay, **centralizing the king** is the better strategic choice.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nf4e4\n```",

Black has very few legal moves \u2014 we must be cautious not to remove all of Black\u2019s mobility.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the immediate threats and opportunities:\n\n### Goal:\nCheckmate or force the black king to the edge while avoiding stalemate. The most efficient path is likely to restrict the black king and deliver checkmate, possibly using the queen and king coordination.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWe must avoid moves that stalemate Black. For example, if we play Qg3\u2013g5, that would attack h5 and threaten mate on g6 \u2014 but is it safe?\n\nLet\u2019s test a few key options:\n\n#### 1. **g3g5** \u2014 Queen to g5\n- Attacks h5 pawn\n- Threatens mate on g6 if Black plays ...Kf4 or if king moves away\n- After 1...Kf4, then 2.Qg6! \u2014 now Black must play ...h4 (only legal move), then 3.Qg3! and Black is in zugzwang \u2014 eventually loses\n- But wait: after 1. Qg5, Black must move \u2014 only legal move is **h5h4** (since Ke4 has no other squares: d5, d4, d3, e3, f3, f4, f5 are all controlled by the queen or off-board)\n  - After 1...h4, now Black king still on e4 \u2014 only legal move is **e4f4**\n  - Then 2. Qg6! \u2014 now Black must play h4h3 (only legal move)\n  - Then 3. Qg3! \u2014 now Black king on f4, no legal moves \u2014 **stalemate!** \u274c\n\nSo **g3g5** leads to stalemate \u2014 avoid!\n\n#### 2. **g3e5+** \u2014 Queen checks on e5\n- Forces king to d3 or f4\n- If 1...Kd3, then 2.Qd5+ Kc2, then 3.Qa2+ Kb3, etc. \u2014 messy, no immediate win\n- Not precise\n\n#### 3. **g3f4+** \u2014 Queen checks on f4\n- 1...Kd5 (only move)\n- Now queen controls d4, e5, f5 \u2014 king is on d5\n- Then 2.Qf7+ or 2.Qf5+ \u2014 but king can go to c4 or e4 \u2014 no immediate mate\n- Again, not forcing\n\n#### 4. **g3h4!** \u2014 Queen captures the h5 pawn!\nLet\u2019s test this:\n\n1. **g3h4**  \n- Now Black king on e4 \u2014 what are its legal moves?\n  - d5, d4, d3, e3, f3, f4, f5 \u2014 all must be checked for control\n- Queen on h4 controls:\n  - Entire h-file, 4th rank, and diagonal to d8\n- Does queen on h4 control any of those king squares?\n  - d5? No\n  - d4? No\n  - d3? No\n  - e3? No\n  - f3? No\n  - f4? \u2705 Yes \u2014 h4 controls f4\n  - f5? No\n\nSo Black king on e4 can move to: d5, d4, d3, e3, f3, f5 \u2014 all still legal except f4\n\nSo after **g3h4**, Black has many legal moves \u2014 no stalemate risk.\n\nNow, what is the best follow-up?\n\nAfter 1. Qxh5, Black must move king \u2014 say 1...Kf5  \nThen 2. Qh7+! \u2014 forces king back toward center  \nThen 2...Ke4 (only), then 3. Qg6+ Kd5, then 4. Qf5+ \u2014 and we can slowly push the king to the edge.\n\nBut better: after 1. Qxh5, play **g1f1** next to activate the king \u2014 but that\u2019s not immediate.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a faster mate?\n\nWhat about **g3g6**?\n\n1. Qg6 \u2014 threatens mate on g5 or g7\n- Black king on e4 \u2014 can go to d3, d4, d5, e3, f3, f4, f5\n- Queen on g6 controls:\n  - g-file, 6th rank, and diagonal to a2\n- Does it control any of those king squares?\n  - f5 \u2705\n  - f4 \u2705\n  - e3 \u274c\n  - d4 \u274c\n  - So king can still go to d3, d4, d5, e3, f3\n\nNo immediate mate, but it restricts f4/f5 \u2014 useful.\n\nBut again, not forcing.\n\n### Best Move: **g3e3+** \u2014 Queen checks on e3!\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n1. **g3e3+**\n- Black king must move:\n  - From e4, legal moves: d5, d4, d3, e3 (illegal \u2014 queen is there), f3, f4, f5\n  - But e3 is now attacked \u2014 so king cannot stay\n  - So king must go to one of: d5, d4, d3, f3, f4, f5\n\nNow, crucially, after 1...Kd5, we play 2. Qe7! \u2014 now king cannot go to d4 or e4 or f5 \u2014 must go to c4 or d6\n\nThis begins a classic queen + king mating net.\n\nBut even better: after 1. Qe3+ Kf5, then 2. Qf3+! \u2014 now king must go to g5 or e5\n\nIf 2...Kg5, then 3. Qg3+ Kh6 (only), then 4. Qg6# \u2014 mate!\n\nIf 2...Ke5, then 3. Qf7! \u2014 controls d5, e6, f6, g5 \u2014 king must go to d4 or f4 or d6 or f6 \u2014 all lead to quick mate.\n\nThis is precise, forcing, and avoids stalemate.\n\n\u2705 **g3e3+** is a strong, forcing move that leads to a quick mate in a few moves.\n\nLet\u2019s confirm:  \n1. Qe3+  \n- If 1...Kf5  \n  2. Qf3+ Kg5  \n  3. Qg3+ Kh6  \n  4. Qg6#  \n\nPerfect.\n\nNo stalemate risk. Immediate progress.\n\n```\ng3e3\n```",

The only legal moves are:\n- `e4f5` (King to f5)\n- `e4d5` (King to d5)\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nWhite has a queen on e3, pawns on c2, b2, f2, g2, and a king on g1. Black has a king on e4 and a pawn on h5.\n\nBlack's king is in the center, and White's queen is active. Black must be careful not to allow the queen to infiltrate or create threats.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate both candidate moves:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `e4f5` (King to f5)\n\n- King moves toward the center-right.\n- This keeps the king away from the queenside where White has more pawns.\n- It also avoids immediate opposition with the White king.\n- However, it may allow White to push the f-pawn or bring the queen to f3/f4 with pressure.\n\n#### 2. `e4d5` (King to d5)\n\n- King moves toward the center-left.\n- This brings the king closer to the queenside, potentially threatening to capture on c4 if White pushes c4.\n- Also, it avoids being too far from the h5 pawn.\n- More importantly, it prepares to challenge White's central control and possibly infiltrate on c4 or e4.\n\n---\n\n### Tactical Consideration:\n\nWhite's queen is on e3, and the king is on g1. Black's king is on e4. If Black plays `e4d5`, it threatens to go to c4 and possibly infiltrate White's position.\n\nIf White tries to push c4, Black can respond with Kxc4, gaining a pawn and improving king activity.\n\nAlso, moving to d5 gives better access to the center and queenside, which is generally more favorable in endgames.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`e4d5`**, as it improves the king's position, prepares to challenge White's structure, and avoids unnecessary exposure to the center-right.\n\n```\ne4d5\n```",

The only legal moves are:\n\n- `d5e6` (King captures Queen)\n- `d5c5` (King moves to c5)\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n#### Move 1: `d5e6` (King captures Queen)\nThis is a **very strong move**. Black captures White's queen with the king. After this, White has no major pieces left and only pawns and a king. Black will be up a queen for a pawn \u2014 a decisive material advantage.\n\nAfter `d5e6`, White's best reply would be to push a pawn or try to activate the king, but Black will have a completely winning position.\n\n#### Move 2: `d5c5`\nThis avoids capturing the queen. It keeps the queen on the board. While it might seem like a way to avoid giving away material, it's clearly inferior because Black is giving up a chance to win by capturing the queen.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is clearly **`d5e6`**, capturing the queen and securing a massive material advantage.\n\n```\nd5e6\n```",

The critical elements:\n\n### 1. **Material:**\n- Only kings and pawns remain.\n- White has a 5v1 pawn majority on the queenside and center.\n- Black has one pawn on h5 \u2014 currently blocked and not an immediate threat.\n\n### 2. **King positions:**\n- White king is on g1 \u2014 very passive.\n- Black king is on e6 \u2014 centralized and potentially dangerous if it reaches the white pawns.\n\n### 3. **Key strategic goals:**\n- **White must advance a passed pawn to promotion.**\n- The c3 pawn is currently isolated and weak \u2014 must be protected or advanced.\n- The black king is dangerously close to the center and can stop white pawns if it reaches them.\n- White must activate the king \u2014 **this is the most urgent priority.**\n\n### 4. **Candidate moves:**\nFrom the legal moves list:\n- `g1h2`, `g1h1`, `g1f1` \u2014 king moves\n- `c3c4` \u2014 advances the isolated pawn\n- `g2g3`, `f2f3`, `b2b3`, `a2a3`, `g2g4`, `f2f4`, `b2b4`, `a2a4` \u2014 pawn moves\n\n#### Evaluate king moves:\n- `g1h2` \u2014 brings king toward center and queenside, supports potential b- or c-pawn advance. Good.\n- `g1f1` \u2014 also central, but less active than h2.\n- `g1h1` \u2014 passive, no improvement.\n\n#### Evaluate pawn moves:\n- `c3c4` \u2014 weakens the pawn structure; if black king reaches d5, it can capture c4. Too risky now.\n- Other pawn moves (like a2a4, b2b4, etc.) are premature \u2014 the king must lead the way in pawn endgames.\n\n### 5. **Principle:**\nIn king and pawn endgames, **the king must lead the pawns**. The current position is not yet won \u2014 but it is easily winning **if White activates the king**.\n\nThe best move is to start centralizing the king.\n\n### 6. **Best move:**\n`g1h2` \u2014 this is the most active and logical king move. It heads toward the center, supports future pawn advances on the queenside, and prevents the black king from infiltrating.\n\nIf White plays passively (e.g., a2a4), Black can play Ke6-d5, then Kd5-c4, and win the c3 pawn \u2014 drawing or even winning.\n\nSo, **activate the king now**.\n\n```\ng1h2\n```",

But if Black plays h3 now, and White doesn\u2019t respond by capturing, it\u2019s over.\n\nSo, what happens if White does nothing?  \nIf White plays, say, a2-a3, then Black plays h4-h3!, and now:\n- If White captures h3xh3, Black promotes h2-h1=Q+ and wins.\n- If White doesn\u2019t capture, h3-h2 and promotes.\n\nSo White **must** prevent h4-h3 in the first place.\n\n### Best Move:\nWhite must play **h2-h3**, immediately blocking the h4 pawn.\n\nThis:\n- Stops h4-h3 (now illegal \u2014 pawn blocked)\n- Maintains the king in front of the pawn\n- Gives White time to bring other pawns forward or centralize the king\n\nAfter **h2-h3**, Black must move the king or wait. The h4 pawn is now stuck unless the king supports it \u2014 but Black\u2019s king is far away on e6.\n\nWhite can then slowly centralize the king and push pawns. This is likely a draw with best play, but White avoids immediate loss.\n\n### Why not other moves?\n- Any pawn move (like c3c4, g2g3, etc.) allows h4-h3! and Black wins.\n- King moves like h2g1 or h2h1 allow h4-h3 unimpeded \u2014 then h3-h2=Q+ and game over.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly **h2-h3** holds the position. It\u2019s the only move that prevents immediate loss and keeps the game alive.\n\n```\nh2h3\n```",

Black has a king and a pawn on h4, while White has a king and pawns on b2, c3, f2, g2, and h3.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **Black's king is on e6**, and it's Black's turn to move.\n- **White's king is on h3**, very close to the h4 pawn.\n- **Black's only pawn is on h4**, which is currently under threat from White's king.\n- **White's pawns are on the queenside and center**, but not immediately threatening.\n- The position is extremely delicate. Black must avoid losing the h4 pawn or allowing White to promote a pawn.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black (from e6):\n- `e6f7`, `e6e7`, `e6d7`, `e6f6`, `e6d6`, `e6f5`, `e6e5`, `e6d5`\n\nWe need to evaluate each move to see which one gives Black the best chance to hold or even win.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move Analysis:\n\n#### 1. `e6f7` \u2013 King moves toward the center and away from the h4 pawn.\n- This abandons the h4 pawn, which is now lost.\n- After `e6f7`, White plays `Kh3-g4` and captures the pawn.\n- Black cannot stop the loss of the pawn and will be left with only the king.\n- **Result: Losing. Not good.**\n\n#### 2. `e6e7` \u2013 King stays on the same file, slightly more centralized.\n- Still doesn't help defend h4.\n- White can still play `Kh3-g4` and take the pawn.\n- **Result: Losing. Not good.**\n\n#### 3. `e6d7` \u2013 King moves toward the queenside.\n- Again, too far from the action on the kingside.\n- White takes h4 easily.\n- **Result: Losing. Not good.**\n\n#### 4. `e6f6` \u2013 King moves one step closer to h4.\n- Now the king is on f6, one square away from h4.\n- White can respond with `Kh3-g4`, threatening to take the pawn.\n- Black can then play `Kf6-g5`, defending the pawn.\n- This leads to a drawn king and pawn endgame.\n- **Result: Draw. Good.**\n\n#### 5. `e6d6` \u2013 King moves diagonally toward the center.\n- Too far from the h4 pawn.\n- White takes h4.\n- **Result: Losing. Not good.**\n\n#### 6. `e6f5` \u2013 King moves two squares toward h4.\n- Now on f5, only two squares from h4.\n- White can play `Kh3-g4`, and after `Kf5-g5`, the pawn is defended.\n- Similar to `e6f6`, this leads to a draw.\n- **Result: Draw. Good.**\n\n#### 7. `e6e5` \u2013 King moves down the e-file.\n- Too far from the h4 pawn.\n- White takes h4.\n- **Result: Losing. Not good.**\n\n#### 8. `e6d5` \u2013 King moves diagonally down-left.\n- Too far from the h4 pawn.\n- White takes h4.\n- **Result: Losing. Not good.**\n\n---\n\n### Best Moves:\nThe best moves are **`e6f6`** and **`e6f5`**, both of which allow Black to defend the h4 pawn and reach a drawn king and pawn endgame.\n\nBetween them, **`e6f6`** is slightly better because it keeps the king closer to the center and allows for more flexibility in case White tries to create a passed pawn on the queenside.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne6f6\n```",

But after ...Kf5, Black can still try to win the c3 pawn or race.\n- `h3g4` \u2014 captures the h4 pawn immediately! This is a **critical winning move**.\n\nLet\u2019s test `h3g4`:\n\n1. **h3g4** \u2192 White captures the h4 pawn.\n   - Now Black has **no pawns left**.\n   - White has multiple pawns (c3, a2, b2, f2, g2).\n   - Black king is on f6 \u2014 too far to stop a central or queenside pawn.\n   - White can now advance the c-pawn or central pawns with king support to promote.\n\nAfter `h3g4`, Black has no counterplay. The h-pawn is gone, and the Black king is too far from any of White\u2019s pawns to stop them.\n\nOther moves like `h3h4` allow Black to play `h4h3`, creating a passed pawn that will promote unless White sacrifices the king\u2019s position \u2014 which would be losing.\n\n### Why not other moves?\n- Any pawn move like `c3c4`, `f2f3`, etc., allows Black to push `h4h3` and promote \u2014 instant loss.\n- `h3h2` or `h3g2` are king retreats \u2014 suicidal here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly **`h3g4`** removes the immediate threat and wins the game by eliminating Black\u2019s only pawn while keeping all of White\u2019s pawns intact.\n\n```\nh3g4\n```",

White is to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **White King** is on g4.\n- **Black King** is on f6 \u2014 centralized but slightly passive.\n- **White has pawns** on a2, b2, c3, f2, g2, h2 \u2014 all on the 2nd rank except c3.\n- **Black has only one pawn** on h3 \u2014 a dangerous passer about to promote!\n- Black\u2019s h3 pawn is one square away from queening. If it gets to h2, it promotes next move.\n- It\u2019s **White to move** \u2014 critical moment.\n\n### Immediate Threat:\nBlack\u2019s h3-pawn is about to promote. If White does **not** stop it, Black wins immediately.\n\nThe only way to stop it is to capture it or block it \u2014 but it's already on h3. The only legal way to stop it is to **capture it with the king**.\n\nCurrently, the White king on g4 can move to:\n- h4 (g4h4)\n- h5 (g4h5)\n- f4 (g4f4)\n- f3 (g4f3)\n- g3 (g4g3)\n- f3 again\n- or h3 directly: **g4h3**\n\n**g4h3** captures the h3 pawn immediately.\n\nIf White plays any other move, Black plays **h3h2**, then queens next move \u2014 and with no counterplay, White loses.\n\n### Why other moves fail:\n- Any pawn move (like c3c4, f2f3, etc.) allows h3h2 \u2014 game over.\n- King moves like g4h4 or g4f4 just let Black promote \u2014 no time!\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly **g4h3** stops the pawn and wins the game. After that, White has a winning king + 6 pawns vs lone king. The rest is technique.\n\nThis is a forced win \u2014 no other move draws or wins.\n\n```\ng4h3\n```",

The c-pawn is isolated and not immediately dangerous.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal moves list:\n- `h3h4` \u2014 advances king toward center, but leaves king exposed to e5\u2013f4\u2013g3 infiltration.\n- `h3g4` \u2014 brings king closer to center, controls f5, e5 entry points.\n- `h3g3` \u2014 safer retreat, centralizing king slightly.\n- `c3c4` \u2014 advances isolated pawn, but may become a target if Black king gets to d4.\n- `g2g3/g2g4/f2f3/f2f4` \u2014 kingside pawn moves to prepare a pawn storm.\n- `a2a3/b2b3` \u2014 passive, not helpful now.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\nThe most important thing is **king activity**. The White king must get involved.  \nCurrently, it's on h3 \u2014 too passive. The best way to improve the position is to bring the king toward the center and support potential kingside pawn breaks.\n\nLet\u2019s assess:\n- `h3g4` \u2014 This is excellent. It:\n  - Centralizes the king\n  - Controls f5 and e5 squares\n  - Prevents Black king from going to f4 or d4 easily\n  - Keeps all options open for pawn advances (g4\u2013g5 later, or f4)\n  - Does not weaken anything\n\nCompare to:\n- `h3h4` \u2014 allows ...Kf4, then ...Kg3, and suddenly Black invades \u2014 dangerous.\n- `c3c4` \u2014 premature; Black plays ...Ke4, attacks c4, and may win the pawn.\n\n### Best Move:\n**`h3g4`** \u2014 improves king position, prevents Black king from advancing, and keeps all options open.\n\nThis is the most accurate and safest way to press the advantage.\n\n```\nh3g4\n```",

There are pawns on both sides, but the position is very simplified.\n\n### Move History (UCI):\n- d5e6, g1h2, h5h4, h2h3, e6f6, h3g4, h4h3, g4h3, f6e5, h3g4\n\nThis indicates that both kings have been maneuvering in the center, and we are in an endgame with minimal material.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black (from e5):\n- `e5f6`, `e5e6`, `e5d6`, `e5d5`, `e5e4`\n\nWe must choose the best move here. Let's evaluate each:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5f6`\n- King moves to f6.\n- This puts the black king closer to the center and potentially supports any future counterplay.\n- It also keeps pressure on the white king, which is currently on g4.\n- However, it may allow White to advance pawns on the kingside.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5e6`\n- King moves up to e6.\n- This is a strong centralizing move.\n- It threatens to infiltrate further into White's position.\n- From e6, the king can support potential pawn breaks or restrict White's king.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5d6`\n- King moves to d6.\n- This is a backward move; it gives up central control.\n- Not ideal unless there's a specific tactical reason.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5d5`\n- King moves to d5.\n- Central square, but slightly passive.\n- May not be as effective as moving toward the kingside.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5e4`\n- King moves to e4.\n- Very aggressive.\n- Places the king directly in front of White's pawns.\n- Could lead to a race if White pushes pawns.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe key idea for Black is to **centralize the king** and **pressure White's pawns**, especially since White has a majority on the kingside (pawns on f2, g2, h2). If White can push those pawns, they could become dangerous.\n\nAmong all options, **`e5e6`** stands out as the most active and centralizing move. It prepares to challenge White's king and pawns, and keeps maximum flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne5e6\n```",

Push the c-pawn to create a passed pawn, or\n  2. Use the king to support it or distract Black.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal moves list:\n```\ng4h5, g4g5, g4h4, g4f4, g4h3, g4g3, g4f3, c3c4, g2g3, f2f3, b2b3, a2a3, f2f4, b2b4, a2a4\n```\n\n#### 1. **c3c4** \u2014 This is a critical move!\n- It creates a protected passed pawn on c4.\n- Now, if Black tries ...Ke5\u2013d5\u2013c4, White can play Kf4 or Ke4 to support the pawn.\n- After c3\u2013c4, the c-pawn becomes a strong threat.\n- Black must respond immediately \u2014 otherwise White will push c5, c6, etc., and promote.\n\nLet\u2019s test this:\n- After `c3c4`, Black must play ...Ke5\u2013d6\u2013c6 or ...Ke5\u2013d5 to challenge the pawn.\n- But White\u2019s king is closer to the center now \u2014 it can support the pawn or race to the queenside.\n\nCompare with other king moves:\n- `g4h5`? King moves away from center \u2014 Black plays ...Ke5\u2013d5\u2013c4, takes c3, draws.\n- `g4g5`? Same \u2014 king moves away; Black takes c3.\n- Any king move away from the center or c3 is dangerous.\n\nOnly **c3c4** immediately strengthens White\u2019s position and creates a real threat.\n\n### Why not other pawn moves like f2\u2013f4 or a2\u2013a4?\n- They do nothing to stop Black from taking c3.\n- They waste time in a race where White must act now.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**c3c4** is the only move that:\n- Creates a protected passed pawn\n- Forces Black to react immediately\n- Keeps the White king in position to support or distract\n- Presses the advantage relentlessly\n\nThis is a precise, winning move in a delicate king and pawn endgame.\n\n```\nc3c4\n```",

Black has no pawns left.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack must try to win or at least avoid losing. With only a king, Black cannot win unless White makes a mistake. The best Black can hope for is a draw.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `e6f7`\n- `e6e7`\n- `e6d7`\n- `e6f6`\n- `e6d6`\n- `e6e5`\n\nWe need to evaluate each move and see which one gives Black the best chance to hold a draw.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move Analysis:\n\n#### 1. `e6f7`\nMoves the king toward the center and slightly forward. Not particularly useful in holding a draw.\n\n#### 2. `e6e7`\nCentralizes the king slightly more. Still not ideal for drawing.\n\n#### 3. `e6d7`\nMoves the king toward the queenside. Could be useful if trying to approach White's pawns on the queenside, but White's king is already well-placed to defend them.\n\n#### 4. `e6f6`\nBrings the king closer to the center and supports potential opposition play. This is a common technique in king and pawn endgames \u2014 trying to get into a position where you can oppose the enemy king.\n\n#### 5. `e6d6`\nAlso centralizing, but less effective than `e6f6`.\n\n#### 6. `e6e5`\nThis is the most interesting move. It brings the king closer to the center and threatens to infiltrate White's position. It also prepares for possible opposition play against White's king.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n\nThe best move is **`e6e5`**, because:\n- It brings the king closer to the center.\n- It prepares for opposition play.\n- It restricts White's king mobility.\n- It keeps the game balanced and avoids giving White an easy path to promote a pawn.\n\nWhite will have to be careful not to allow Black to infiltrate and create a passed pawn.\n\n---\n\n```\ne6e5\n```",

The key is to **support the pawn\u2019s promotion** while keeping the opposition or outflanking the black king.\n\n### Goal:\nPromote the c-pawn safely. The black king is on e5 \u2014 it can reach the queening square (c8) in 3 moves. White must either:\n- Get the king in front of the pawn (ideal: king on b6 or d6), or\n- Use the distant opposition and precise timing to prevent the black king from stopping the pawn.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n- **c4c5** \u2014 Immediate pawn push. Let's analyze this deeply.\n- **g4h5, g4g5, etc.** \u2014 King moves. But the king must support the pawn \u2014 moving away from the center may be dangerous.\n\nLet\u2019s test **c4c5**:\n\nAfter **1. c4c5**, the pawn moves to c5.  \nBlack king must respond. Best is **Ke5-d6**, trying to intercept.\n\nNow White plays **2. Kg4-f5!**, entering the square of the pawn and gaining ground.  \nBlack must stay close: **Kd6xc5**, and now White plays **3. Kf5-e5**, taking the opposition.\n\nFrom here, White can force the black king away and promote the pawn.\n\nThis is a **winning line**.\n\nIf instead, after 1. c4c5, Black plays Ke5-d5, then White plays Kg4-f5! again \u2014 now the white king enters the square of the pawn and will support its promotion.\n\nAny other move delays the win or risks letting the black king get in front.\n\n### Why not king moves first?\n- If White plays a king move like g4h5 or g4f3, Black can simply play Ke5-d4 or Ke5-d5, getting closer to the c-pawn.\n- The pawn must be pushed now \u2014 it\u2019s on the 4th rank, and delaying gives Black time to centralize.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best and most precise move is **c4c5** \u2014 it starts the march of the pawn while the white king is close enough to support it. Any delay risks letting the black king get into a better square.\n\n```\nc4c5\n```",

Let's evaluate each candidate:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `e5f6` (King to f6)\n- King moves toward the center and closer to the White king.\n- This could help in a potential opposition or zugzwang setup.\n- Keeps king active and central.\n\n#### 2. `e5e6` (King to e6)\n- King moves forward, but into a more restricted space.\n- May allow White to push pawns with tempo.\n- Less flexible than f6.\n\n#### 3. `e5d5` (King to d5)\n- King moves toward the queenside.\n- Could support a potential breakthrough if Black had pawns there.\n- But currently, Black has no pawns on the queenside.\n\n#### 4. `e5e4` (King to e4)\n- King advances further, but risks being pushed back by White's king.\n- May lead to a race where White can promote first.\n\n#### 5. `e5d4` (King to d4)\n- King moves diagonally forward-left.\n- Similar issues as e4 \u2014 too far without support.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Evaluation:\n\nThe key idea here is **zugzwang** \u2014 forcing White to make a move that weakens their position. Black should aim to restrict White's king and pawns while keeping options open.\n\nThe most flexible and strategically sound move is:\n\n### `e5f6`\n\nThis keeps the king centralized, avoids overcommitting, and prepares for possible opposition or zugzwang scenarios.\n\n---\n\n```\ne5f6\n```",

White has a king on g4, pawns on a2, b2, c5, f2, g2, h2.  \nBlack has only a king on f6.\n\nWhite is up a pawn \u2014 in fact, White has a protected passed pawn on c5, and Black\u2019s king is too far away to stop it.\n\n**Goal:** Promote the c-pawn.\n\nCurrent key features:\n- White king is on g4 \u2014 far from the action.\n- Black king is on f6 \u2014 it can potentially stop the c-pawn if it gets close enough.\n- The critical line is: if White plays c5-c6, then c6-c7, c7-c8=Q \u2014 but Black must not be able to reach c7 in time.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the race:\n\n- White plays **c5\u2013c6** now.\n- Next move: c6\u2013c7\n- Then c7\u2013c8=Q\n\nThat\u2019s 2 moves to promotion.\n\nHow many moves does Black\u2019s king need to reach c7?\n\nFrom f6:\n- f6\u2013e6 (1)\n- e6\u2013d6 (2)\n- d6\u2013c7 (3)\n\nSo Black needs **3 moves** to reach c7.\n\nWhite needs only **2 moves** to promote.\n\nTherefore, **if White just pushes the pawn now, it promotes safely**.\n\nBut we must be cautious: is there any way for Black to interfere or for White to blunder?\n\nBlack has no pieces \u2014 only the king. So no checks, no threats.\n\nWhite must not move the king unnecessarily \u2014 it might get distracted or allow the Black king to approach.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- `c5c6` \u2014 starts the promotion march. Leads to forced win.\n- Any king move (like `g4h5`, `g4f4`, etc.) wastes time \u2014 Black\u2019s king gets closer.\n- Other pawn moves (like `g2g3`, `f2f3`) are irrelevant \u2014 they don\u2019t help the win.\n\n**Best move:** `c5c6` \u2014 this is a decisive winning move. It starts the march of the passed pawn, and Black cannot stop it.\n\nAfter:\n1. c5\u2013c6 Ke6  \n2. c6\u2013c7 Kd7  \n3. c7\u2013c8=Q\n\nCheckmate soon follows.\n\nAny other move delays the win and risks allowing the Black king to get closer \u2014 for example, after `g4h5?`, Black plays `f6\u2013e5`, and now the king is closer to the c-pawn.\n\nSo we must not be greedy with king activity \u2014 just push the pawn!\n\n```\nc5c6\n```",

Black is to move, and the board looks like this:\n\n```\n8 | . . . . . . . .\n7 | . . . . . . . .\n6 | . . P . . k . .\n5 | . . . . . . . .\n4 | . . . . . . K .\n3 | . . . . . . . .\n2 | P P . . . P P .\n1 | . . . . . . . .\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nBlack's king is on f6, White's king is on g4. There are pawns on both sides: White has pawns on b2, a2, f2, g2, and c6; Black has no pawns left.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack must try to win or at least avoid losing. The only way to make progress is by using the king actively and trying to promote a pawn (but Black has no pawns). So the goal is likely to prevent White from promoting their c6 pawn and possibly draw by opposition or stalemate.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black (from given list):\n- `f6g7`\n- `f6f7`\n- `f6e7`\n- `f6g6`\n- `f6e6`\n- `f6e5`\n\nWe'll evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `f6g7` \u2013 King moves to g7\n- This puts the king closer to the center and supports potential counterplay.\n- It also keeps pressure on the c6 pawn indirectly.\n- Keeps options open for both defense and possible triangulation.\n\n#### 2. `f6f7` \u2013 King moves to f7\n- Too passive.\n- Doesn't help in stopping the c6 pawn.\n- May allow White to advance the c-pawn with tempo.\n\n#### 3. `f6e7` \u2013 King moves to e7\n- Centralizing the king.\n- Could be useful in supporting a future ...e5 break (but Black has no pawns).\n- Still too far from the action around c6.\n\n#### 4. `f6g6` \u2013 King moves to g6\n- Very active.\n- Cuts off the White king from advancing further.\n- Puts pressure on the g-file and could restrict White's king mobility.\n- Good candidate.\n\n#### 5. `f6e6` \u2013 King moves to e6\n- Also active.\n- Places the king directly in front of the c6 pawn.\n- Might be able to block its advance.\n- Strong contender.\n\n#### 6. `f6e5` \u2013 King moves to e5\n- Very aggressive.\n- Gets the king very close to the c6 pawn.\n- Could potentially capture it if White isn't careful.\n- However, it might be overextending.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Evaluation:\n\nThe key is to **stop the c6 pawn** from advancing. The best way to do that is to place the king in front of it or near it.\n\nBetween `f6e6` and `f6e5`, `f6e6` is more precise because:\n- It blocks the pawn's path.\n- It doesn't overextend.\n- It maintains flexibility.\n\nAlso, moving to e6 gives Black the option to go to d6 or f6 next, depending on how White responds.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\nf6e6\n```",

White wins.\n- If `Ke6-d7`, same thing: `c7c8=Q+` and the king must move away \u2014 White wins easily.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is the c7 square safe for the pawn?  \nYes. The Black king is on e6, which is two squares away from c7 \u2014 it cannot capture on c7 immediately.\n\nSo after `c6c7`, Black has no way to stop the pawn from queening next move.\n\nNow, what about other moves?\n- Any king move (like `g4h5`, `g4g5`, etc.) delays the win and gives Black time to approach the pawn. For example, if White king moves aimlessly, Black king can go `Ke6-d6` and then capture the c6 pawn if it's not pushed.\n- Pushing other pawns (like `g2g3`, `f2f3`) is irrelevant \u2014 this is a king + pawn vs king endgame, and the only winning plan is to promote the c-pawn.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only winning move \u2014 and the best move by far \u2014 is to push the pawn to c7, forcing immediate promotion next move regardless of Black's reply.\n\nThis is a textbook \"key square\" win in a king and pawn vs king endgame. The c6 pawn is already on the 6th rank, and the defending king is not in front of it \u2014 White wins by advancing.\n\n```\nc6c7\n```",

Black is to move, and the only piece left for Black is the king on e6. White has a pawn on c7, two pawns on the queenside (a2, b2), and two on the kingside (f2, g2). The White king is on g4.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack must prevent White from promoting the c7 pawn. If Black can stop that, or force a draw, it's a good result. If possible, Black should aim to win.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The c7 pawn is one square away from queening.\n- Black's king is on e6, which is in a position to potentially intercept the c7 pawn.\n- White's king is on g4, far from the action on the queenside.\n- Black's best chance is to use the king to stop the c7 pawn from promoting.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black (King on e6):\n- `e6f7`, `e6e7`, `e6d7`, `e6f6`, `e6d6`, `e6e5`, `e6d5`\n\nWe need to evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `e6f7` \u2013 King moves to f7\n- This puts the king closer to the c7 pawn.\n- From f7, the king can go to e8, d7, or g8.\n- It's a strong move to intercept the c7 pawn.\n\n#### 2. `e6e7` \u2013 King moves to e7\n- Also close to the c7 pawn.\n- From e7, king can go to d7, f7, or d8.\n- Good control over the center.\n\n#### 3. `e6d7` \u2013 King moves to d7\n- Directly in front of the c7 pawn.\n- This is the most direct way to stop the pawn.\n- After this, if White plays `c7c8q`, Black can respond with `d7c8`.\n\n#### 4. `e6f6` \u2013 King moves to f6\n- Too far from the c7 pawn.\n- Not useful in stopping the pawn.\n\n#### 5. `e6d6` \u2013 King moves to d6\n- Also a good square, one step away from c7.\n- From d6, king can go to c7 or e7.\n\n#### 6. `e6e5` \u2013 King moves to e5\n- Too far from the c7 pawn.\n- Not useful.\n\n#### 7. `e6d5` \u2013 King moves to d5\n- Also too far from the c7 pawn.\n- Not useful.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most effective move is **`e6d7`**, placing the king directly in front of the c7 pawn. This gives Black the best chance to stop the pawn from promoting.\n\nIf White plays `c7c8q`, then Black can respond with `d7c8`, capturing the new queen and likely forcing a draw.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne6d7\n```",

Black has a king on d7. It's White to move.\n\nWhite's goal: Promote the c7 pawn safely.  \nBlack's goal: Prevent promotion by getting the king to c8 in time.\n\nCurrent position:\n- White king: g4\n- Black king: d7\n- White pawn: c7\n- White to move\n\nBlack's king is dangerously close \u2014 only two squares away from c8 (d7\u2013c8). If White simply pushes the pawn now (`c7c8q`), Black replies `Kd7-c7` and captures the queen immediately. So **pawn promotion now is a blunder**.\n\nWhite must first **gain the opposition or restrict the black king** to prevent it from reaching c8.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the key idea:\n\nWhite must **lose a tempo** or **force the black king away** so that after promotion, the black king cannot recapture.\n\nThis is a classic king and pawn endgame where the key is to **get the white king to support the pawn**.\n\nThe white king is on g4 \u2014 very far from the action. But there is a critical idea: **zugzwang** or **tempo loss** via king triangulation.\n\nHowever, in this case, the best and most direct plan is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Promote the pawn with check, but only when the black king cannot recapture.**\n\nHow?\n\nWhite must **prevent the black king from reaching c7** after promotion.\n\nCurrently, if White plays:\n- `c7c8Q+`, Black plays `Kd7xc8` \u2192 draw.\n\nSo we must **not promote yet**.\n\nInstead, we must **move the king closer** to support the pawn.\n\nThe white king must reach the queenside \u2014 ideally to b5 or d5 \u2014 to control the queening square or prevent the black king from invading.\n\nBut the only way to make progress is to **lose a tempo** or **force the black king to move**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the legal moves:\n\nKey candidates:\n- `g4f5` \u2014 centralizes the king\n- `g4f4` \u2014 also central\n- `g4h5` \u2014 too far away\n- `c7c8q` \u2014 blunder, as discussed\n- `g2g3`, `f2f3` \u2014 irrelevant, too slow\n\nThe best plan is to **march the king toward the pawn**. The shortest path is via f5 \u2192 e6 \u2192 d7 or d5.\n\nBut we must be careful: if we play `g4f5`, Black plays `Kd7-c6`, and now the black king is heading straight for c7.\n\nSo we must **gain the opposition** or **control the square in front of the pawn**.\n\nActually, this is a known theoretical position: the pawn is on c7, king on d7 \u2014 if it's White to move and the white king is not nearby, it's often a draw unless White can promote **with check** and prevent recapture.\n\nBut here, the white king is far away \u2014 so we must **not promote now**.\n\nInstead, the only winning idea is to **lose a tempo** using the king to force the black king to move first \u2014 but we can't triangulate easily from g4.\n\nWait \u2014 there\u2019s a critical resource:\n\nWhite can play:\n**`g4f5!`**\n\nThis threatens to march the king to e6 and then d7, gaining ground.\n\nIf Black responds `Kd7-e7`, then White plays `Kf5-e5`, and now the white king is making progress toward the pawn.\n\nBut better yet \u2014 what if we play:\n\n**`g4f4!`**\n\nThis is more flexible \u2014 keeps options open.\n\nBut the best move \u2014 and the only one that wins \u2014 is:\n\n**`g4f5!`**\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n\n1. `g4f5` Kd7-c6  \n2. `Kf5-e6` Kc6-b7  \n3. `Ke6-d7` Kb7xc7  \n4. `Kd7xc7` \u2014 now White has a king on c7, and the pawn is gone, but it's a king vs king endgame \u2014 draw.\n\nHmm \u2014 that doesn\u2019t win.\n\nWait \u2014 we must promote only when the black king cannot capture.\n\nSo the correct idea is:\n\n**White must promote with check, and the black king must not be on c7 or c8.**\n\nSo we must **force the black king away from the c-file**.\n\nHow?\n\nBy using the white king to threaten the black king \u2014 but from where?\n\nThe only way is to **get the white king to e6 or d5** to control c7.\n\nBut the black king will always stay in the square of the pawn.\n\nHold on \u2014 this is actually a **draw** if White promotes now or moves the king randomly.\n\nBut wait \u2014 look at the current position again:\n\nWhite king on g4, Black king on d7, pawn on c7.\n\nIf White plays:\n\n**`g4f5`**, Black must not allow the white king to reach e6.\n\nIf Black plays `Kd7-e7`, then `Kf5-e5`, and now `Ke5-d6`, and White threatens to support the pawn.\n\nBut Black can still play `Ke7-d8` or `Ke7-c7`.\n\nThis is getting complex.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the distance:\n\n- Black king to c8: 2 moves (d7\u2013c7\u2013c8)\n- White king to c8: g4\u2013f5\u2013e6\u2013d7\u2013c8 = 4 moves\n- So the black king can get there first.\n\nTherefore, **White must promote only when the black king is not on c7 or c8**.\n\nHow to force that?\n\nAnswer: **Zugzwang** \u2014 but only if we can triangulate.\n\nBut from g4, triangulation is impossible.\n\nSo the only winning idea is to **promote with check** \u2014 but only if the black king is not on c7.\n\nSo we must **force the black king off the c-file**.\n\nHow?\n\nBy playing:\n\n**`g4f4!`**\n\nThen if Black plays `Kd7-c6`, White plays `Kf4-e5`.\n\nNow Black must move \u2014 if `Kc6-b7`, White plays `Ke5-d6`, and now the black king is forced to move away from the c-file.\n\nEventually, White can play `c7c8Q+` with the black king on b7 or d7 \u2014 and it cannot recapture.\n\nYes \u2014 this is the plan.\n\nBut the most accurate and forcing move is:\n\n**`g4f5!`**\n\nBecause it gains ground and forces the black king to react.\n\nAfter:\n1. `g4f5` Kd7-c6  \n2. `Kf5-e6` Kc6-b7  \n3. `Ke6-d7` Kb7xc7  \n4. `Kd7xc7` \u2014 draw.\n\nNo \u2014 still draw.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we play:\n\n**`g4h5!`** \u2014 no, that\u2019s away from the action.\n\nHold on \u2014 the only way to win is to **promote with check** and have the black king not on c7.\n\nSo we must **lose a tempo** \u2014 but we can\u2019t.\n\nThis position is actually a **draw** with best play.\n\nBut wait \u2014 look at the legal moves again.\n\nThere is a **critical resource**:\n\nWhite can play:\n\n**`c7c8Q+!`** \u2014 but only if Black cannot recapture.\n\nBut Black can: `Kd7xc8`.\n\nSo that\u2019s a draw.\n\nBut what if we play:\n\n**`g4f4`**, then `Kd7-c6`, then `Kf4-e5`, then `Kc6-b7`, then `Ke5-d6`, then `Kb7-a7`, then `Kd6-c7`, and now the black king is on a7 \u2014 far away.\n\nThen White plays `c7c8Q+` \u2014 and Black king cannot recapture. Win!\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. `g4f4`  \n2. `Kd7-c6`  \n3. `Kf4-e5`  \n4. `Kc6-b7`  \n5. `Ke5-d6`  \n6. `Kb7-a7`  \n7. `Kd6-c7`  \n8. `c7c8Q+` \u2014 check, and Black king is on a7 \u2014 cannot capture. Win.\n\nYes \u2014 this works.\n\nSo the first move must be:\n\n**`g4f4`**\n\nThis is the only move that starts the winning king march.\n\nOther king moves like `g4f5` are slower or allow Black to stay central.\n\nTherefore, the best and only winning move is:\n\n```\ng4f4\n```",

White has a pawn on c7, kings on f4 and e6 respectively. Black's king is on e6, just one square away from capturing the pawn if it doesn't promote immediately.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White to move.\n- The c7 pawn is one move away from queening.\n- Black\u2019s king is on e6 \u2014 it can reach c7 in two moves (e6\u2013d7\u2013c7), but it's currently too far to stop the promotion **if White promotes now**.\n- If White doesn\u2019t promote, Black will play ...Ke6-d7 and capture the pawn next move.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n- **c7c8q** \u2014 Promote to queen immediately. This wins instantly because after promotion, Black has no checks, and White\u2019s king is close enough to support the queen in delivering checkmate or forcing resignation.\n- Other king moves like f4g5, f4e4, etc., allow Black to play ...Ke6-d7, capturing the c7 pawn on the next move \u2014 throwing away the win.\n- Any pawn move other than promoting (like g2g3) is a blunder \u2014 it gives Black time to take the c7 pawn.\n\n### Evaluation:\nThis is a **win for White**, but **only if the pawn promotes now**. Delaying promotion loses the win.\n\nAfter **c7c8q**, the position becomes:\n`Q7/8/4k3/8/5K2/8/PP3PP1/8 b - - 0 69`\n\nBlack has no checks, no counterplay, and the white king is close enough to assist in checkmating or simply advancing.\n\nEven if Black tries to run away, the queen supported by the king will corner the black king quickly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis is a forced win. The only correct move is immediate promotion.\n\n```\nc7c8q\n```",

White's king is on f4.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black:\n- `e6f7`\n- `e6e7`\n- `e6f6`\n- `e6d6`\n- `e6d5`\n\nWe must choose the best move for Black. Since Black has no material left, the goal is to either:\n- Force a draw (e.g., stalemate, insufficient material, or perpetual check),\n- Or, if possible, win by capturing all of White's pawns and forcing a queen vs. king endgame.\n\nBut in this position, White has a queen and several pawns, so Black cannot win unless White makes a mistake.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `e6f7` \u2013 King moves to f7\n- This places the king on the edge of the board.\n- It doesn't threaten anything and may allow White to centralize their king or push pawns.\n- Not ideal.\n\n### 2. `e6e7` \u2013 King moves to e7\n- Centralizes the king slightly.\n- Still passive.\n- Doesn't create any threats.\n\n### 3. `e6f6` \u2013 King moves to f6\n- Brings the king closer to the center and toward the white king.\n- Could potentially set up a stalemate if White isn't careful.\n- Also keeps the king active.\n\n### 4. `e6d6` \u2013 King moves to d6\n- Centralizes the king.\n- Keeps options open.\n- Could be useful in trying to approach White's pawns.\n\n### 5. `e6d5` \u2013 King moves to d5\n- Most active move.\n- Places the king in the center.\n- Threatens to infiltrate White's position.\n- Could lead to a stalemate if White isn't precise.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most active and potentially drawing move is **`e6d5`**. It places the king in the center and gives Black the best chance to force a draw by stalemate or insufficient material if White misplays.\n\nWhite will have to be extremely careful not to blunder into a stalemate or allow Black to capture all pawns and force a queen vs. king draw.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne6d5\n```",

The goal is to **checkmate Black as efficiently as possible**, avoiding any stalemate or draw.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Black\u2019s king is on d5 \u2014 central but exposed.\n- White\u2019s king is on f4 \u2014 relatively close to assist in mating.\n- No pawns are near promotion; all pawns are on the second rank (a2, b2, f2, g2).\n- The white queen on c8 must deliver mate, likely with king support.\n\n### Critical Danger:\nAvoid moves that stalemate Black. For example, if the queen cuts off all escape squares without delivering check, and the king has no legal moves, it\u2019s a draw.\n\nBlack\u2019s king on d5 currently has these legal squares:\n- c6, c5, c4, d4, e4, e5, e6 \u2014 all currently empty.\n\n### Goal:\nUse the queen to restrict the black king while the white king advances to assist in a corner or edge mate.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWe must **check** the black king to prevent any waiting moves and force progress.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate queen checks:\n\n- **c8e6+** \u2192 Queen to e6, checks king on d5.  \n  Black king must move: from d5, options are c5, e5, or d4 (e6 now occupied).  \n  After c8e6+, king moves to c5 or e5 \u2014 both lead to rapid mate with king support.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n- 1. c8e6+ Kd4  \n  Now black king on d4 \u2014 white king on f4 can move to e3 or f3 to assist.  \n  Then Qe6-e5+ or Qe6-d6+ can force king toward edge.\n\nBut better:  \n- 1. c8e6+ Kc5  \n  Now king on c5 \u2014 white king can march to e5 or d3 to help corner.\n\nEven better:  \nTry **c8a6+** \u2014 queen to a6, checks king on d5.  \nWhy? Because it restricts the king to fewer squares.\n\n- 1. c8a6+  \n  Black king must go to c5 or d4 (c6 and d6 are not attacked).  \n  If 1...Kc5, then white king moves to e5 \u2014 now king on c5, white king on e5, queen on a6 \u2014 queen can go to b7 or a7 to force king to a-file.\n\nBut still, **c8e6+** is more central and flexible.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **c8d7+**?  \nQueen to d7, checks king on d5.  \nBut that\u2019s a **stalemate risk**:  \n- 1. c8d7+?? Kxd7 \u2192 stalemate!  \n\ud83d\udeab **Illegal move \u2014 leads to immediate draw. Avoid!**\n\nSimilarly, avoid any queen move that allows king to capture the queen with no other pieces.\n\nSo, eliminate any queen move that lands where the king can capture it without being in check from elsewhere \u2014 like c8d7, c8c7, etc.\n\n### Best Move:\n**c8e6+** \u2014 this is a safe check, doesn\u2019t allow capture, and forces the black king to move to a less central square.\n\nAfter 1. c8e6+:\n- If 1...Kc5, then 2. Ke5 (king marches in), then Qe6-e7 or Qe6-a6 to restrict further.\n- If 1...Kd4, then 2. Ke2 (or Ke3) \u2014 king supports queen, and soon mate via Qe6-e5+ or Qe6-d6+.\n\nThis is the most forcing and safest path to mate.\n\n### \u2705 Final Decision:\n```\nc8e6\n```",

The only legal moves are:\n- `d5e6` (King captures Queen)\n- `d5c5` (King moves to c5)\n- `d5d4` (King moves to d4)\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n#### 1. **Material:**\n- White has a queen and two pawns.\n- Black has only a king.\n- White is up a queen and two pawns \u2014 a decisive material advantage.\n\n#### 2. **King Safety:**\n- Black's king is in the center, but not under immediate threat.\n- White's king is also centralized, but not threatening anything directly.\n\n#### 3. **Threats:**\n- White's queen is on e6, eyeing the black king.\n- Black's king is in danger of being checked or mated if it doesn't move carefully.\n\n#### 4. **Legal Moves Analysis:**\n\n##### a) `d5e6` (King captures Queen)\n- This is the most obvious move.\n- Black captures the queen with the king.\n- After this, White will have only two pawns and a king.\n- Black still has a king.\n- This simplifies the position significantly and removes the immediate danger.\n\n##### b) `d5c5`\n- King moves to c5.\n- Keeps the queen on the board.\n- White can continue with Qe6+ or Qc6+, keeping pressure.\n- Not ideal; allows White to keep the queen and continue pressuring.\n\n##### c) `d5d4`\n- King moves to d4.\n- Again, keeps the queen on the board.\n- White can respond with Qe6+ or Qd6+, maintaining pressure.\n- Also not ideal.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`d5e6`**, capturing the queen. This eliminates White's main attacking piece and reduces the danger to Black's king. It also gives Black a fighting chance to hold a draw or even win if White misplays.\n\nAfter `d5e6`, the position becomes:\n- Black king on e6\n- White king on f4\n- White pawns on b2, a2, f2, g2\n\nThis is a king and pawn endgame, and with correct play, Black may be able to draw depending on how White proceeds.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nd5e6\n```",

The key is to avoid stalemate and shepherd a pawn to promotion while keeping the black king from interfering.\n\n**Current position summary:**\n- White king on f4 \u2014 central and active.\n- Black king on e6 \u2014 also central, but not yet in front of any pawn.\n- White pawns: a2, b2, f2, g2 \u2014 all on second rank.\n- The most advanced pawn is none \u2014 all on 2nd rank. So we must push one forward.\n\n**Candidate moves (from given legal list):**\n- King moves: f4g5, f4g4, f4e4, f4g3, f4f3, f4e3\n- Pawn moves: g2g3, f2f3, b2b3, a2a3, g2g4, b2b4, a2a4\n\nWe must be cautious: the black king is close enough to interfere with pawn promotion if we're not careful. The ideal plan is to centralize the king and support a queenside or kingside pawn majority.\n\nWhite has a **queenside pawn majority (a2, b2)** and a **kingside pawn majority (f2, g2)**. But the kingside is more dangerous because the black king is on e6 \u2014 it can easily reach f5, g5, etc., to stop kingside pawns.\n\nThe best plan is to **push a queenside pawn**, because:\n- The black king is far from the queenside (e6 vs a-file).\n- White can support the a- or b-pawn with the king.\n- This avoids the risk of stalemate that can arise if we push kingside pawns too aggressively (e.g., if black king gets in front of them).\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the best pawn push:\n\n- **a2a4**: Doubles the a-pawn, creates a protected passer eventually. Black king is too far to stop it.\n- **b2b4**: Same idea \u2014 but a2a4 is better because it opens the a-file and gives more space.\n- **g2g4 or f2f3**: Premature \u2014 black king can get in front of these easily.\n\n**King moves**: Not ideal yet \u2014 we should start with a pawn move to create a threat. The king can follow.\n\n**Best move: a2a4**\n\nWhy?\n- It starts creating a protected passed pawn on the queenside.\n- Black king must now choose: go toward queenside (slow, takes many moves) or stay central \u2014 but it can\u2019t stop both sides.\n- After a4, next will be a5, then b4, and so on \u2014 classic minority attack.\n- Most importantly: **this move does not risk stalemate** \u2014 unlike pushing g-pawn or f-pawn, which can lead to zugzwang if black king gets in front.\n\nLet\u2019s confirm: after a2a4, black king must move. Even if it heads toward queenside (e6-d5-c4), it\u2019s too slow \u2014 White can push a5, b4, and promote.\n\nThis is a textbook winning plan in king + pawns vs king.\n\n```\na2a4\n```",

The material is equal (both sides have a king and pawns), but the position is critical.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Black's king is on e6, White's king on f4\n2. White has pawns on a4, b2, f2, g2\n3. Black has no pawns remaining\n4. The position appears to be a race to promote pawns\n\nLegal moves for Black: e6f7, e6e7, e6d7, e6f6, e6d6, e6d5\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n1. e6f7: Moves king towards White's pawns but leaves the center\n2. e6e7: Moves king forward but doesn't immediately threaten anything\n3. e6d7: Moves king towards the queenside where White has pawns\n4. e6f6: Moves king towards White's king\n5. e6d6: Moves king towards the queenside\n6. e6d5: Moves king towards the queenside and closer to White's pawns\n\nThe critical factor is that White has a passed pawn on a4 which could become dangerous. Black needs to either:\n- Stop the a-pawn from promoting\n- Create counterplay with the king\n\nThe best move appears to be e6d5 because:\n1. It moves the king towards the queenside where White's a-pawn is\n2. It prepares to potentially capture the a4 pawn if White isn't careful\n3. It maintains central control\n4. It's more active than moving towards the kingside\n\nOther moves either don't address the a-pawn threat or move the king away from the critical area.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6d5\n```",

White to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **White King** is on f4, **Black King** on d5 \u2014 both central and active.\n- White has pawns on a4, b2, f2, g2, and h2 (but only a4 and b2 are relevant now).\n- Black has no pawns \u2014 this is critical. Black cannot promote anything.\n- The only way for Black to draw is by perpetual opposition or stalemate tricks \u2014 but with no pawns, and White having multiple pawns, **White should win** if they don't blunder.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite must **promote one of the pawns**, preferably the a-pawn or b-pawn, since the kings are near the center and the a-pawn is already on the 4th rank.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal moves list:\n```\nf4g5, f4f5, f4g4, f4g3, f4f3, f4e3, a4a5, g2g3, f2f3, b2b3, g2g4, b2b4\n```\n\nWe must evaluate which move makes progress toward promotion **without allowing the Black king to catch the pawn**.\n\n#### Critical Idea:\n- If White plays **a4\u2013a5**, Black king can race to stop it: ...Kd5\u2013c5\u2013b5\u2013a5, potentially drawing if White isn't careful.\n- So, White must **support the a-pawn with the king** or **create a second weakness**.\n\nLet\u2019s test the most forcing and logical candidate:\n\n### 1. a4a5 \u2014 push the a-pawn\nAfter `a4a5`, Black must respond with `Kd5\u2013c5` to try to stop it.\nThen White can play `Kf4\u2013e5`, centralizing the king and supporting the b-pawn or preparing to escort the a-pawn.\n\nBut is this safe?\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n- 72. a4a5 Kd5c5  \n- Now if 73. b2b4+, Black must play Kc5xb4 \u2014 and now White has a protected passed pawn on a5, and the king can march in: Kf4e5, then Ke5d4, etc. \u2014 White wins easily.\n\nAlternatively, after 72. a4a5 Kc5, White can play **b2\u2013b3** to prevent ...Kb4, or better yet, **Kf4\u2013e5** to centralize and support both pawns.\n\nSo `a4a5` is strong \u2014 but is it the best?\n\nWhat about **b2\u2013b4**? That creates a protected passer if Black takes, but after `b2b4`, Black plays `Kd5\u2013c4`, attacking the b-pawn. Then White must defend it with king or a-pawn \u2014 messy.\n\nWhat about king moves?  \n- `f4e5`? Then Black plays `Kd5\u2013e6`, and the kings chase \u2014 no progress.\n- `f4g5`? King goes to g5 \u2014 too far from the pawns, Black king takes a4 or b2 easily.\n\n### Best Plan:\nUse the **opposition and king support** to escort the a-pawn.  \nThe key is to **push a4\u2013a5 now**, forcing the Black king to commit.\n\nIf Black doesn\u2019t take the a-pawn route, White can push b2\u2013b4 later to create a second threat.\n\nThus, the best move is:\n\n```\na4a5\n```\n\nThis forces Black to react, and White can then bring the king in to support the queenside pawns. No counterplay for Black \u2014 this is a winning path.\n\n\u2705 This move starts the winning plan with no risk of draw.\n\n```\na4a5\n```",

Black has the move, and the board looks like this:\n\n```\n[Empty board except:]\nWhite pawns: a5, b2, f2, g2\nBlack king: d5\nWhite king: f4\n```\n\nBlack's king is in the center, and White has a passed pawn on a5. The key for Black is to prevent the a-pawn from queening while trying to make progress.\n\n### Legal moves for Black (from d5):\n- `d5e6`\n- `d5d6`\n- `d5c6`\n- `d5c5`\n- `d5d4`\n- `d5c4`\n\nWe must choose the best move to either win or draw.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n#### Goal:\nBlack wants to stop the a-pawn from promoting. The white king is close to supporting it. If Black can get the king in front of the pawn or capture it, that would be ideal.\n\nCurrently, the black king is on d5. The a5 pawn is two squares away from promotion. The white king is on f4 \u2014 not immediately threatening to support the a-pawn, but could come over.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `d5e6` \u2013 King moves toward the center\n- Brings king closer to the center.\n- Not directly helping with stopping the a-pawn.\n- May allow White to push a6 and then a7 with king support.\n\n**Not ideal.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. `d5d6` \u2013 King advances up the board\n- Gets closer to the a-pawn.\n- Still too far to stop a6-a7 unless White blunders.\n- White can respond with Ke5 or Kf5, supporting the pawn.\n\n**Too slow.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. `d5c6` \u2013 King heads toward the queenside\n- This is promising.\n- Cuts off escape routes for the a-pawn.\n- If Black can reach c5 or b5 in time, he can threaten to capture the pawn.\n\n**Strong candidate.**\n\n---\n\n### 4. `d5c5` \u2013 King steps to c5\n- Very active.\n- Now within striking distance of the a5 pawn.\n- Threatens to go to b5 or c4 to attack the pawn.\n- White will have to be careful.\n\n**Best move so far.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. `d5d4` \u2013 King moves down\n- Too passive.\n- Doesn't help in stopping the a-pawn.\n- Gives White more freedom.\n\n**Not good.**\n\n---\n\n### 6. `d5c4` \u2013 King moves to c4\n- Also active.\n- But slightly less direct than c5.\n- Still within range to influence the queenside.\n\n**Good, but not as strong as c5.**\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`d5c5`**, which places the black king in a strong central position on the queenside, ready to challenge the a5 pawn and potentially win the game if White plays inaccurately.\n\n```\nd5c5\n```",

King moves like f4e5, f4e4 \u2014 too slow.\n- Black responds with Kc5-b5, then captures a5.\n- Draw.\n\n#### 3. b2b3 or b2b4 \u2014 irrelevant.\n- The b-pawn is too far from promotion.\n- Black just takes a5.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only winning move is to **push the a-pawn now** \u2014 `a5a6`.\n\nThis forces:\n- Black must play `c5b5` (only move to prevent immediate queening).\n- Then White plays `f4e5`, centralizing the king and preparing to support either pawn.\n- Eventually, White will promote the a-pawn or the b-pawn, depending on Black's defense.\n\nAny other move allows Black to draw by capturing the a5 pawn.\n\n```\na5a6\n```",

It prepares to challenge White's plan of pushing a7 and promoting. If White plays a7, Black can respond with Kxa7 and then try to hold the rest of the position.\n\nIt's the most active and purposeful move in this position.\n\n---\n\n```\nc5b6\n```",

So after:\n  - 1. a7 Kb7\n  - Now 2. b2b3/b4/g3/g4/f3 \u2014 any waiting move would allow Black to take the a7 pawn with ...Kxa7, drawing.\n\nSo **prematurely pushing a6a7 is a mistake** \u2014 it allows Black to draw by capturing the pawn after Kb7.\n\nWhite must **zugzwang** Black \u2014 force the black king to move away from b6 or c6, so that a6a7 can be played with tempo (i.e., with check or threat of queening).\n\nCurrently, the black king must stay near b6 to prevent a6a7. But if White can lose a tempo with a pawn move while keeping the king in position, Black will be forced to move the king away, and then White can promote.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWe must avoid:\n- `a6a7?` \u2192 Kb7! \u2192 draw\n- King moves like `Kf4-e4`, `Kf4-g4`, etc. \u2014 they move away from the center and don't help; Black just waits.\n\nSo we must **lose a tempo with a pawn**, keeping the king on f4 to retain flexibility.\n\nWhich pawn can move without weakening the position?\n\n- `g2g3` / `g2g4` \u2014 not helpful; king is far away\n- `f2f3` \u2014 same\n- `b2b3` or `b2b4` \u2014 these are promising! Why?\n\nBecause after `b2b3` or `b2b4`, the b-pawn becomes a potential threat. More importantly, **it's a waiting move** \u2014 it doesn\u2019t change the status of the a6 pawn, but it forces Black to respond.\n\nLet\u2019s test:\n- 1. b2b3 Kb6\n- Now White still has a6 pawn, and Black must still guard b7 \u2014 same position, but now it\u2019s Black to move again!\n- But wait \u2014 has anything changed?\n\nNo \u2014 Black can just stay on b6. So this doesn\u2019t force anything.\n\nWe need a **true waiting move** \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t alter the key squares around a6.\n\nThe best waiting move is actually:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **g2g3**\n\nWhy?\n- It doesn\u2019t affect the a6 pawn.\n- It doesn\u2019t weaken the king position.\n- It\u2019s a pure waiting move \u2014 White king stays on f4, ready to march to the queenside if needed.\n- Black has no useful pawn moves \u2014 only the king can move.\n- So after `g2g3`, Black must move the king from b6.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n1. g2g3 Kb6\u2013c6\nNow White plays: 2. a6a7!  \nBlack king is on c6 \u2014 too far to stop promotion.  \n2... Kc6b7  \n3. a7a8=Q+ \u2014 check, and White wins easily.\n\nIf instead after 1. g2g3, Black plays Kb6\u2013a5:\nThen 2. Kf4\u2013e5! (king marches in), and now the b2 pawn becomes a second threat \u2014 Black cannot stop both a7 and b3+b4.\n\nBut even simpler: after 1. g2g3, any Black king move from b6 allows 2. a7.\n\nSo **g2g3 is the only move that loses a tempo without risk** \u2014 it forces Black to abandon b6.\n\nOther moves like b2b3 or b2b4 might seem similar, but they slightly weaken the pawn structure or create unnecessary targets. g2g3 is clean.\n\n### \u2705 Best Move: `g2g3`\n\n```\ng2g3\n```",

Black has a king on b6, and White has a king on f4, pawns on a6, b2, f2, and g3. It's Black to move.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack must try to win or at least avoid losing. The key is to prevent White from promoting any pawns while trying to make progress with Black's own king.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- White has a dangerous passed pawn on **a6**, which is very close to promotion.\n- Black's king is currently on **b6**, directly in front of the a6 pawn.\n- If Black can keep the king in front of the a6 pawn, it can be stopped.\n- Black also has a pawn on **b2**, which is not yet advanced but could become a threat if White's king gets too far.\n- White's king is on **f4**, relatively centralized and can support the g3 and f2 pawns.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n- `b6c7` \u2013 King moves away from the a6 pawn, allowing it to advance.\n- `b6a7` \u2013 King steps to the side, still in front of a6.\n- `b6c6` \u2013 King moves toward center, still in front of a6.\n- `b6a6` \u2013 King captures the pawn! This is a critical move.\n- `b6c5`, `b6b5`, `b6a5` \u2013 King moves away from the a6 pawn.\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most critical move is **`b6a6`**, capturing the pawn. Let's evaluate:\n\n- After `b6a6`, Black removes the dangerous a6 pawn.\n- Now, Black's king is on a6, and White's king is on f4.\n- Black still has a pawn on b2, and White has pawns on f2 and g3.\n- Black's king is now active and can potentially support the b2 pawn or interfere with White's pawns.\n\nThis is the only move that eliminates White's most dangerous asset (the a6 pawn). All other moves allow White to push a6-a7 and create a passed pawn that will be hard to stop.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is to capture the pawn on a6.\n\n```\nb6a6\n```",

White has a king on f4, pawns on g3, f2, and b2.  \nBlack has only a king on a6.  \nWhite is to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White has a clear material advantage (3 pawns vs none).\n- The black king is cut off on the queenside, but it's dangerously close to potentially stopping the b-pawn if not handled correctly.\n- White\u2019s goal is to promote one of the pawns \u2014 most likely the b-pawn or the g-pawn.\n- The white king is currently central but must assist in promoting a pawn.\n- The most advanced pawn is the b2-pawn, but it needs support to advance safely.\n- Black king is on a6 \u2014 if the b-pawn advances to b4, then b5, the king can reach b6 and stop it unless the white king supports.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal moves list:\n- **King moves**: f4g5, f4f5, f4e5, f4g4, f4e4, f4f3, f4e3  \n- **Pawn moves**: g3g4, f2f3, b2b3, b2b4\n\nWe must avoid:\n- Letting the black king reach b5 or c5 in time to stop the b-pawn.\n- Wasting time \u2014 this is a theoretical win for White, but precision is needed.\n\n### Plan:\nThe best plan is to push the **b-pawn** with king support.  \nWhite should play **b2b4** \u2014 this gains space and threatens b5.  \nBut we must ensure the black king can't reach b5 in time.\n\nLet\u2019s test the critical line:\n\n1. **b2b4**  \n   Now, if Black plays Ka6\u2013b6, White replies **Kf4\u2013e5**, supporting the b-pawn and centralizing the king.  \n   After Kb6\u2013c6, White plays **Ke5\u2013d4**, keeping the king in front of the pawn and preventing Black from getting in front.\n\nAlternatively, if Black stays on a6 after b2b4, White continues with **b4b5+**, forcing the king to b7 or a7, then Kf4\u2013e5\u2013d6, supporting the pawn to promotion.\n\nOther moves like g3g4 or f2f3 are passive and waste time \u2014 Black\u2019s king can then approach the b-pawn.\n\n**b2b3** is slower \u2014 it doesn\u2019t challenge Black\u2019s control of b4.\n\nSo, the best and most forcing move is:\n\n```\nb2b4\n```",

White to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **White King** is on f4, **Black King** on b5.\n- White has pawns on b4, f2, and g3.\n- Black has no pawns \u2014 only the king.\n- The critical pawn is the b4-pawn \u2014 it's on the 4th rank, and Black's king is close to it (b5).\n- The goal for White is to promote the b-pawn or force a win via zugzwang or king activity.\n- Black\u2019s king is threatening to capture the b4 pawn if not defended.\n\n### Immediate Threat:\n- If White does nothing, Black plays ...Kxb4 and wins the pawn. So White must either:\n  - Defend b4 (e.g., king moves to e5 or e4 to support it), or\n  - Push b4-b5 to create a protected passer.\n\nBut **b4b5+** is not a legal move \u2014 it's not in the list of legal moves. So we cannot push the pawn now \u2014 it must be supported first.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n```\nf4g5, f4f5, f4e5, f4g4, f4e4, f4f3, f4e3, g3g4, f2f3\n```\n\nWe must choose one of these. Let's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. **f4e5** \u2014 King moves to e5\n- Now the king supports b4 directly (via d4-c5-b6 etc.).\n- It also centralizes the king and threatens to march toward the queenside.\n- After Ke5, Black must respond. If ...Kxb4, then Kd4, and White can chase the king away and promote the b-pawn.\n- This is a strong, active move \u2014 supports the critical pawn and improves king position.\n\n#### 2. **f4e4** \u2014 King to e4\n- Also supports b4 indirectly, but less effectively than e5.\n- From e4, king must go d5 to support b5 push \u2014 one extra tempo.\n- Less efficient than e5.\n\n#### 3. **f4g5 / f4f5 / f4g4 / f4f3 / f4e3 / g3g4 / f2f3**\n- These moves do **not** help support the b4 pawn.\n- They waste time or even weaken White\u2019s position.\n- For example, f4g5 or f4f5 moves the king away from the queenside \u2014 Black plays ...Kxb4 and wins.\n- Similarly, g3g4 or f2f3 are irrelevant \u2014 they don\u2019t help the key battle on the queenside.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only move that prevents immediate loss and makes progress is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **f4e5**\n\nThis move:\n- Secures the b4 pawn by supporting it via the king.\n- Prepares to push b4-b5 if Black\u2019s king retreats.\n- Centralizes the king for future activity.\n- Eliminates any chance of Black capturing the b-pawn.\n\nThis is the only move that maintains the win. All others allow Black to win the b-pawn and likely draw or even win.\n\n```\nf4e5\n```",

P ....\n..... P.\n..... P.\n........\n```\n\nBlack's king is on b5, White's king is on e5. Pawns are on b4, g3, f2, and White has a passed pawn on b4. Black has no pawns left.\n\n### Goal:\nThis is a king and pawn endgame. Black must try to either:\n- Win by capturing all of White's pawns and promoting one of their own (but Black has no pawns),\n- Or force a draw if winning is not possible.\n\nWhite's plan is to advance the b-pawn and promote it. Black's only hope is to stop that pawn or create counterplay.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black (from b5):\n- `b5c6`\n- `b5b6`\n- `b5a6`\n- `b5c4`\n- `b5b4`\n- `b5a4`\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `b5c6`\nMoves the king toward the center. Keeps pressure on the b4 pawn. Good control over key squares.\n\n#### 2. `b5b6`\nPushes the king forward, but doesn't threaten anything directly. May allow White to push b5 and gain space.\n\n#### 3. `b5a6`\nMoves away from the action. Not ideal.\n\n#### 4. `b5c4`\nCentralizes the king slightly. Could be useful in supporting a potential ...c4 break (but Black has no pawns).\n\n#### 5. `b5b4`\nCaptures the pawn! This is a critical move. Let's explore this deeply.\n\nIf `b5b4`, then:\n- White's b-pawn is gone.\n- White's king is on e5, so it can quickly support the g3 and f2 pawns.\n- Black's king is now on b4, which is very active.\n- Black can try to infiltrate with the king and possibly win the g3 or f2 pawns.\n\nThis seems like the most aggressive and promising move.\n\n#### 6. `b5a4`\nMoves the king to the edge. Not useful.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\n- `b5b4` removes a dangerous pawn and gives Black active play.\n- After `b5b4`, White cannot immediately promote.\n- Black can then try to infiltrate with the king and win other pawns.\n\nThis move puts maximum pressure and gives Black the best chance to win or at least complicate matters.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n```\nb5b4\n```",

Black has only a king on b4.\n\nWhite to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White has two pawns: g3 and f2. They are not passed yet, but with correct play, one can promote.\n- Black\u2019s king is on b4 \u2014 far away from the action, but it can potentially intercept a pawn if it advances carelessly.\n- The white king is on e5 \u2014 central and active.\n- Black has no pawns or pieces \u2014 only the king. So, White must avoid stalemate and force a win via pawn promotion.\n\n### Goal:\nPromote one of the pawns (preferably the f-pawn, as it is closer to queening and the king can support it better).\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal moves list:\n- King moves: `e5f6, e5e6, e5d6, e5f5, e5d5, e5f4, e5d4`\n- Pawn moves: `g3g4, f2f3, f2f4`\n\nWe must advance a pawn while keeping the king in front or near to support. The key idea is to **create a passed pawn and advance it with king support**.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\n#### 1. `f2f4` \u2014 This creates a protected passed pawn immediately. The f-pawn becomes passed because Black\u2019s king is too far to stop it now.\n- After `f2f4`, the pawn is on f4, and the white king is on e5 \u2014 perfect square to support it.\n- Black king on b4 would need 4 moves to reach f4 (b4\u2192c5\u2192d6\u2192e6\u2192f5), but White can advance the pawn with king support and promote it in 5 moves:\n  - f4\u2013f5\u2013f6\u2013f7\u2013f8=Q\n  - King can escort it: e5\u2013e6\u2013e7 etc.\n\nThis is a clean, winning plan.\n\n#### Why not `g3g4`?\n- That creates a pawn on g4, but it\u2019s not passed \u2014 Black king can still approach from the queenside and potentially stop both pawns if White isn\u2019t careful.\n- Also, the g-pawn is farther from promotion and harder to support.\n\n#### Why not `f2f3`?\n- This is passive. It doesn\u2019t create a passed pawn. Black king can still interfere.\n\n#### King moves?\n- Moving the king first (e.g., `e5d5`) delays the pawn advance and gives Black time to approach. Not optimal when we can create a passed pawn immediately.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is to create a passed pawn **now** with `f2f4`. This gives White a clear, forced win as the king can escort the pawn to promotion while Black\u2019s king remains too far away.\n\n```\nf2f4\n```",

The best way to do that is to keep the Black king close to the center and control key squares around the White pawns.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal moves list:\n- `b4c5`\n- `b4b5`\n- `b4a5`\n- `b4c4`\n- `b4a4`\n- `b4c3`\n- `b4b3`\n- `b4a3`\n\nWe need to find the move that best restricts White's options and keeps the Black king active.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Moves:\n\n#### `b4c5` \u2013 King moves toward the center.\n- This brings the Black king closer to the White king and pawns.\n- It controls d6, b6, and e5.\n- Good centralization.\n\n#### `b4b5` \u2013 King advances up the board.\n- Too far forward; may allow White to push pawns with tempo.\n- Not ideal.\n\n#### `b4a5` \u2013 King moves left.\n- Too passive; gives White more freedom.\n\n#### `b4c4` \u2013 Central square.\n- Controls b5, d5, b3, d3.\n- Good control over central squares.\n\n#### `b4a4` \u2013 Sideways move.\n- Doesn't improve much.\n\n#### `b4c3` \u2013 King moves toward the pawns.\n- Very aggressive.\n- Controls b2, d2, b4, d4.\n- Could be useful in stopping the g3 pawn.\n\n#### `b4b3` \u2013 King moves down.\n- Too far from action.\n\n#### `b4a3` \u2013 King moves to the corner.\n- Very passive.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nBetween `b4c5` and `b4c3`, both are strong.\n\n- `b4c5` keeps the king centralized and flexible.\n- `b4c3` is more direct, aiming to interfere with the g3 pawn.\n\nBut since White's king is on e5, and the pawns are on f4 and g3, the most effective plan is to bring the Black king to c5, where it can influence both the center and the queenside, and potentially cut off escape routes for the White king if it tries to support the pawns.\n\nAlso, from c5, the Black king can go to d6 or b6 to challenge the pawns if needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\nb4c5\n```",

Black king gains ground.\n\n### Best Move:\n**`e5f6`** \u2014 This is the most precise and aggressive move.  \nIt places the king on the critical square f6, one step from f7, and prepares to escort the f-pawn to promotion.  \nBlack\u2019s king is too far (c5 \u2192 needs 4 moves to reach f6: c5-d5-e5-f5-g5-f6 \u2014 too late).  \nWhite will play:\n1. `e5f6`  \n2. `f4f5`  \n3. `f5f6`  \n4. `f6f7`  \n5. `f7f8Q` \u2014 checkmate or win easily.\n\nNo risk of draw here \u2014 this is a forced win.\n\n```\ne5f6\n```",

Black has the move, and the board looks like this:\n\n- **White King** on f6\n- **Black King** on c5\n- **White pawns** on f4 and g3\n- **Black has no pawns**\n\nThe key here is to determine whether Black can stop White's pawns from promoting or if Black can create a passed pawn of their own (though Black has no pawns, so that's not possible). The goal for Black is to prevent White from promoting either of their pawns.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black (from c5):\n- `c5d6`\n- `c5c6`\n- `c5b6`\n- `c5d5`\n- `c5b5`\n- `c5d4`\n- `c5c4`\n- `c5b4`\n\nWe must choose the best move to **maximize Black's chances**, which in this case is likely to **force a draw** by preventing White's pawns from promoting.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nWhite's plan is to push the f-pawn or g-pawn to promotion. Let's see how far each pawn is:\n\n- **f4** \u2192 f5 \u2192 f6 \u2192 f7 \u2192 f8=Q\n- **g3** \u2192 g4 \u2192 g5 \u2192 g6 \u2192 g7 \u2192 g8=Q\n\nBlack's king is on c5, which is quite far from both pawns. However, Black can try to get closer to one of them.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n#### 1. `c5d6` \u2013 King moves toward the center and closer to the f-pawn.\n- This brings the king closer to the f-pawn.\n- After `c5d6`, White may play `f4-f5`, and then Black can respond with `d6-e6` or `d6-c6`.\n\n#### 2. `c5c6` \u2013 King moves up the board.\n- This doesn't help much; it's not heading toward any pawn.\n\n#### 3. `c5b6` \u2013 King moves left.\n- Too far from both pawns.\n\n#### 4. `c5d5` \u2013 Centralizing the king.\n- Good general idea, but still not directly threatening either pawn.\n\n#### 5. `c5b5` \u2013 King moves left.\n- Again, too far from action.\n\n#### 6. `c5d4` \u2013 King moves toward the center and slightly toward the f-pawn.\n- Slightly better than d5, but not as good as d6.\n\n#### 7. `c5c4` \u2013 King moves down.\n- Away from the pawns.\n\n#### 8. `c5b4` \u2013 King moves left and down.\n- Too far from the pawns.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n\nThe most logical move is **`c5d6`**, which brings the black king closer to the **f-pawn**, the more advanced of the two. By doing so, Black increases the chance of drawing by being able to stop the f-pawn from promoting.\n\nIf Black can stop the f-pawn, White will have to promote the g-pawn, but then Black can race to stop that one as well.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n\n```\nc5d6\n```",

White to move.\n\n### Current Position:\n- **White King** on f6  \n- **Black King** on d6  \n- **White pawns** on f4 and g3  \n- **No other pieces**\n\nThe position is extremely delicate \u2014 both kings are close to the pawns, and the key question is whether White can promote a pawn or force a win.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The White king is **in front of its own pawn** on f4, which is good \u2014 it can support its advance.\n- Black king is on d6, just one square away from potentially stopping the f-pawn.\n- If White plays `f4f5`, Black can respond with `Kd6-e5`, and the king will be in front of the pawn \u2014 likely a draw.\n- If White pushes the g-pawn (`g3g4`), it\u2019s too slow \u2014 Black can just wait or approach.\n- The critical idea is: **Can White win the opposition or force zugzwang?**\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the legal moves:\n\n#### 1. `f6g7` \u2014 King to g7:  \n- Abandons the f-pawn, allows Black king to take control of e5/f5.  \n- Losing \u2014 Black draws easily.\n\n#### 2. `f6f7` \u2014 King to f7:  \n- Now White king is on f7, Black king on d6.  \n- Black plays `Kd6-e7`, and now kings oppose on e7/f7 \u2014 draw by opposition.  \n- No progress.\n\n#### 3. `f6g6` \u2014 King to g6:  \n- King moves away from the center \u2014 Black plays `Kd6-e6`, and now both kings are central.  \n- Still no progress \u2014 likely draw.\n\n#### 4. `f6g5` \u2014 King to g5:  \n- Now White king is on g5, Black on d6.  \n- Black can play `Ke6` or `Kd5` \u2014 still no breakthrough.  \n- Not helpful.\n\n#### 5. `f6f5` \u2014 King to f5:  \n- This is **critical**.  \n- Now White king is on f5, Black king on d6.  \n- If Black plays `Kd6-e7`, White replies `Ke5`, and now the White king is in front of the f-pawn \u2014 winning!  \n- If Black plays `Kd6-e5`, White replies `Kf5-f4`, and now the king supports the pawn \u2014 Black must retreat, and White can push `f5` next.  \n- This move **gains the opposition** and puts Black in zugzwang.\n\n#### 6. `g3g4` \u2014 Push g-pawn:  \n- Too slow. Black just waits with `Kd6-e6`.  \n- No threat \u2014 draw.\n\n#### 7. `f4f5` \u2014 Push f-pawn immediately:  \n- This is a **blunder**!  \n- After `f4f5`, Black plays `Kd6-e5`, and now the king is in front of the pawn \u2014 draw.  \n- White loses the win.\n\n### \u2705 Best Move:\n**`f6f5`** \u2014 This is the only move that wins.  \nIt places the White king in front of the f-pawn while forcing Black into a losing zugzwang.  \nNo matter what Black does, White will promote the f-pawn.\n\n```\nf6f5\n```",

White to move.\n\n### Current Position:\n- **White King**: f5  \n- **White Pawns**: f4, g3  \n- **Black King**: c6  \n- **No other pieces**\n\nWhite has a significant advantage: the king is deep in enemy territory and central, while Black\u2019s king is far away. The goal is to promote one of the pawns \u2014 especially the f-pawn, which is only two squares from promotion.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White\u2019s king is on f5, Black\u2019s king is on c6 \u2014 **6 moves away** from stopping the f-pawn if it advances directly.\n- If White plays `f4f5`, then `f5f6`, the pawn will promote in two more moves.\n- However, we must be cautious: if the White king moves away too early, Black might gain time to approach.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the **critical line**:\n\n1. **f4f5** \u2014 advances the pawn. Now it's on f5, one square from queening.\n   - Black must respond with king movement, but from c6, it will take at least 5 moves to reach f6 or f5.\n   - After `f4f5`, the White king can support the pawn or even step aside to let it promote.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the legal moves given are:\n```\nf5g6, f5f6, f5e6, f5g5, f5e5, f5g4, f5e4, g3g4\n```\n\nThis means the **White king is on f5**, and the pawn is on f4 \u2014 so the move `f4f5` is **not listed** as legal. That implies the move list is correct, and we must choose from the king moves or `g3g4`.\n\nSo the pawn is still on f4, and the king is on f5.\n\nWe must now ask: **What is the best way to support the f-pawn\u2019s promotion?**\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n- `f5f6` \u2014 King marches forward toward the 6th rank. But this might be premature \u2014 the king should stay near the pawn to prevent any potential stalemate or loss of control.\n- `f5e6`, `f5g6` \u2014 moving away from the pawn \u2014 bad idea; gives Black time to approach.\n- `f5g5` or `f5e5` \u2014 lateral movement, not helpful.\n- `f5g4` or `f5e4` \u2014 retreats \u2014 no!\n- `g3g4` \u2014 advances the g-pawn. This is a waiting move, but doesn\u2019t help the f-pawn.\n\n### Best Plan:\nThe key idea is to **push the f-pawn next** \u2014 but we must ensure the king is optimally placed to support it.\n\nCurrently, the king is on f5. If we play:\n- `f5f6` \u2014 now king is on f6, and pawn still on f4.\n  - Then Black plays `c6d5` (or similar), and White can play `f4f5`, then `f5f6`, etc.\n  - But now the king is already on f6 \u2014 too far ahead! The pawn lags behind.\n\nBetter plan: **King stays on f5, push the pawn to f5 first** \u2014 but that move is not listed as legal. Wait \u2014 that means the pawn must have already moved to f4, and now it's White to move again.\n\nHold on \u2014 the FEN says: `8/8/2k5/5K2/5P2/6P1/8/8`  \nSo:\n- f4 = White pawn \u2705  \n- f5 = White king \u2705  \n- So the pawn is on f4, king on f5 \u2014 so the pawn cannot move to f5 unless the king moves first.\n\nAh! That\u2019s the key: **The pawn cannot advance to f5 because the king is on f5**.\n\nSo the king must move **first** to allow the pawn to advance.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **f5f6** \u2014 King steps to f6, freeing the f5 square for the pawn.\n\nNow, after `f5f6`, Black must respond \u2014 likely `c6d5` or similar \u2014 then White plays `f4f5`, then `f5f6`, and the pawn promotes.\n\nThis is the most efficient and safe plan. Any other king move delays the promotion or risks losing control.\n\n### Final Decision:\n```\nf5f6\n```",

White to move.\n\n### Material:\n- White: King on f6, pawns on f4 and g3\n- Black: King on c5\n\nWhite has a significant advantage \u2014 the king is deep in enemy territory and central, while Black\u2019s king is far away. The key is to promote one of the pawns, especially the f-pawn, which is only two squares from queening.\n\n### Current Threats:\n- If White plays **f4-f5**, Black\u2019s king cannot stop the f-pawn.\n- White\u2019s king on f6 supports the f-pawn directly.\n- Black\u2019s king is too far to stop promotion unless White makes a mistake.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal moves list:\n- `f6g7`, `f6f7`, `f6e7`, `f6g6`, `f6e6`, `f6g5`, `f6e5` \u2014 all king moves\n- `f4f5` \u2014 push the f-pawn\n- `g3g4` \u2014 push the g-pawn (less urgent)\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **f4f5** is the most forcing and decisive move. After:\n  - 1. f4f5 Kb5 (Black tries to run toward the pawns)\n  - 2. f5f6 Kc6\n  - 3. f6f7 Kb7\n  - 4. f7f8Q \u2014 promotion with an easy win.\n\nAny king move (like f6g7, etc.) allows Black to approach with ...Kd5 or ...Kb5, potentially drawing if White is careless. For example:\n- 1. f6e5? Kb5! 2. f4f5 Kc5! and now the king can stop the pawn \u2014 draw.\n\nSo, **do not move the king** \u2014 it's perfectly placed to support the f-pawn. The only move that wins cleanly and quickly is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **f4f5**\n\nThis creates an unstoppable passed pawn. Black cannot catch it.\n\n### Final Decision:\n```\nf4f5\n```",

The key features:\n- Black's king is on c5\n- White's king is on f6\n- White has pawns on f5 and g3\n- Black has no pawns remaining\n\nThe legal moves for Black's king are: c5d6, c5c6, c5b6, c5d5, c5b5, c5d4, c5c4, c5b4\n\nOur goal is to prevent White from promoting their pawns while trying to create counterplay. The most critical pawn is White's f5 pawn, which is more advanced.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. c5d6: Moves towards White's king but allows f5-f6 which would be dangerous\n2. c5c6: Similar to d6, but less direct\n3. c5b6: Moves away from the action, not ideal\n4. c5d5: Centralizes the king but doesn't address the f5 pawn\n5. c5b5: Moves away from the key area\n6. c5d4: Moves towards the g3 pawn but leaves f5 unchecked\n7. c5c4: Similar to d4, not addressing f5\n8. c5b4: Moves away from the critical area\n\nThe best move appears to be c5d6 because:\n- It directly opposes White's king (f6)\n- It prevents f5-f6 by controlling d6\n- It maintains flexibility to move to c6 or e6 next\n- It keeps the king centralized\n\nOther moves either allow White to advance the f-pawn or move the king away from the critical area.\n\n```\nc5d6\n```",

White has a king on f6 and a pawn on g3; Black has a king on d6. The White pawn on f5 is already promoted \u2014 wait, no: looking again:\n\nWait \u2014 the FEN is:\n```\n8/8/3k1K2/5P2/8/6P1/8/8\n```\n\nSo:\n- White king: f6\n- White pawns: f5 and g3\n- Black king: d6\n- No other pieces\n\nWhite to move.\n\nThe legal moves provided are:\n- `f6g7`, `f6f7`, `f6g6`, `f6g5`, `g3g4`\n\nThat means the pawn on f5 must have just moved \u2014 but it's still on f5. So no promotion yet.\n\nLet\u2019s assess the position:\n\n**Goal**: White must promote one of the pawns, preferably the f-pawn since it's closer to queening (only 2 squares from f5 to f7, then f8=Q). But the Black king is on d6 \u2014 it can potentially stop the f-pawn if it gets close enough.\n\nCurrent threat: If White plays `f5-f6`, Black can play `Kd6-e6`, and then `Ke6xf6` \u2014 draw!\n\nSo White must **prevent the Black king from capturing the f-pawn**.\n\nThe key idea is to use the White king to support the f-pawn\u2019s advance.\n\nWhite king is on f6 \u2014 it's actually **in front of its own pawn** on f5. That\u2019s unusual \u2014 normally you want the king in front of the pawn in a race.\n\nBut here, the White king is *blocking* the f-pawn! So it must move.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the legal moves:\n\n1. `f6g7` \u2014 King moves to g7. Now the f-pawn can advance, but Black king can run to e5, then f5, and possibly catch the pawn. Not ideal.\n2. `f6f7` \u2014 King moves forward to f7. Now the f-pawn is on f5, king on f7 \u2014 too far ahead. Black king can go to e5, then f5, then capture the pawn. Draw.\n3. `f6g6` \u2014 King moves to g6. Still not supporting the pawn directly. Black king can approach via d6-e5-f5. Risky.\n4. `f6g5` \u2014 King moves to g5. Now the king is closer to the action, but not directly supporting the pawn. Black king can still try to reach f5.\n5. `g3g4` \u2014 Pawn move. This does nothing useful \u2014 it doesn\u2019t help the f-pawn promote and wastes a tempo. Not useful.\n\nWait \u2014 none of these king moves seem to directly support the f-pawn?\n\nHold on \u2014 the key idea in king+pawn vs king endgames is to **maintain opposition** or **create a zugzwang**.\n\nBut here, the White king is on f6, Black king on d6 \u2014 they are not in direct opposition.\n\nThe critical idea: **White must advance the f-pawn with support**. But the king is in front of it \u2014 so it must step aside to allow the pawn to advance, but in a way that the king still controls the queening square.\n\nThis is a classic \"key square\" concept.\n\nThe key squares for a pawn on f5 are e6, f6, and g6 \u2014 the three squares one rank ahead. If the White king can occupy one of these, it can support the pawn to promotion.\n\nCurrently, the White king is on f6 \u2014 that\u2019s a key square! But it\u2019s **blocking** the pawn.\n\nSo the correct plan is:\n- Move the king to a square that still controls the key squares, allowing the pawn to advance next move.\n\nThe best move here is:\n\n**`f6g6`** \u2014 King moves to g6.\n\nWhy?\n- Now the king is on a key square (g6), supporting the pawn.\n- Next move, White can play `f5-f6`, and now the Black king cannot stop it:\n  - If Black plays `Kd6-e5`, then `f6-f7`, and the pawn promotes.\n  - If Black plays `Kd6-d5`, same thing \u2014 `f6-f7`, then `f7-f8=Q`.\n\nIf instead White plays `f6g5`, Black can play `Kd6-e5`, and now the king can attack the pawn from the side \u2014 dangerous.\n\nIf White plays `f6g7` or `f6f7`, the king is too far away \u2014 Black king can reach f5 and capture the pawn.\n\nSo `f6g6` is the only move that:\n- Maintains control of the key square (g6),\n- Allows the f-pawn to advance next move without being captured,\n- Forces a win.\n\nThis is a precise endgame technique \u2014 the king must step to the side, not forward or backward, to allow the pawn to advance under protection.\n\n\u2705 Final move:\n\n```\nf6g6\n```",

White to move.\n\n### Current Position:\n- **White King:** g6  \n- **White pawns:** f5, g3  \n- **Black King:** d5  \n- **White to move**\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The White king is already very active, on g6 \u2014 central and advanced.\n- The Black king is on d5, far away from the pawns.\n- White has two pawns: one on f5 (advanced), one on g3 (still on 2nd rank).\n- The f5 pawn is one square away from queening (f6, then f7, f8=Q).\n- Black king is too far to stop the f-pawn if White plays accurately.\n- **Goal:** Promote the f-pawn with king support.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal moves list:\n- `g6h7`, `g6g7`, `g6f7`, `g6h6`, `g6f6`, `g6h5`, `g6g5`, `f5f6`, `g3g4`\n\nWe must prioritize king activity toward the f-pawn\u2019s promotion square (f8). The king must escort or at least not block the pawn.\n\n#### Critical line:\nIf White plays `f5f6`, Black king can approach with ...Kd4, then ...Kd3, and potentially stop the g-pawn or create counterplay \u2014 but only if the White king doesn\u2019t assist.\n\nHowever, the best plan is to **push the pawn only when the king is optimally placed** \u2014 ideally on e7 or f7 to support f6\u2013f7\u2013f8=Q.\n\nCurrently, the White king is on g6. The best square to support the f-pawn\u2019s promotion is **f7** \u2014 it defends f6 and controls e7/d7.\n\nSo the best move is:\n\n### \u2705 `g6f7`\n\nThis places the king directly in front of the f-pawn, one square away from f6, ready to support its march to promotion. It also prevents any stalemate or misstep.\n\nAfter `g6f7`, Black must respond \u2014 but the king is too far (d5) to stop the f-pawn now. For example:\n- 83... Kd4 84. f6 Ke5 85. f7 Kf5 86. f8=Q+ \u2014 and White wins easily.\n\nOther king moves (like g6\u2013g7 or g6\u2013h6) waste time or move away from the pawn.\n\n`f5f6` now is premature \u2014 Black plays ...Kd4 and the king might not catch up in time, but it\u2019s riskier than first centralizing with Kf7.\n\n### Final Decision:\n```\ng6f7\n```",

The position is very delicate as any misstep could lead to a draw or loss\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n- d5d6: Moves towards White's pawns but might be too slow\n- d5c6: Moves away from the action\n- d5e5: Centralizes the king but doesn't immediately threaten anything\n- d5c5: Similar to c6 but less central\n- d5e4: Moves towards White's pawns but might be too slow\n- d5d4: Moves away from the pawns\n- d5c4: Moves away from the pawns\n\nThe best move appears to be d5e5 because:\n1.

White has a king on f7 and a pawn on f5 and g3. Black has only a king on e5.\n\nWhite to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White has two pawns: one on f5 (advanced to 5th rank), one on g3.\n- Black king is on e5 \u2014 very close to the f5 pawn.\n- White king is on f7 \u2014 currently quite far from the action, but can intervene.\n- The immediate threat is that if White plays passively, Black can capture the f5 pawn: ...Ke5xf5, and then the position is likely a draw because White\u2019s remaining g3 pawn is too slow to queen without support.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite must **prevent the capture of the f5 pawn** while advancing toward promotion.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the legal moves:\n\n1. **f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7, f7g6** \u2014 all king moves.\n2. **f5f6** \u2014 push the f-pawn.\n3. **g3g4** \u2014 push the g-pawn (slower, less urgent).\n\n### Critical Idea:\nIf White plays **f5f6**, the pawn advances to f6, now protected by the king on f7. This prevents Black from capturing it (since ...Ke5xf6 would be met by Kf7xf6, and the kings are close).\n\nAfter **f5f6**, Black must retreat the king, and White can then bring the king closer to support the g-pawn or assist f6.\n\nLet\u2019s test this:\n\n**After 1.f5f6!**\n- Black king must move: Ke5-d5 or Ke5-f5\n  - If 1...Kd5, then White plays Kf7-e7, supporting f6 and centralizing.\n  - If 1...Kf5, then Kf7-f8! (or f7-e7), keeping opposition and preventing king entry.\n\nThis move **f5f6** gains a crucial tempo and prevents Black from equalizing by capturing the pawn.\n\nOther king moves like f7g8 or f7e7 allow Black to play **Ke5xf5**, and then:\n- White has only a g3 pawn, which Black\u2019s king can easily stop (e.g., Kf5-f6-g5-h4-g3, etc.). That would be a draw.\n\nSo, **f5f6** is the only winning move \u2014 it creates a protected passed pawn and forces Black\u2019s king away.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlay **f5f6** to secure the win.\n\n```\nf5f6\n```",

It's Black to move.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `e5d6`\n- `e5f5`\n- `e5d5`\n- `e5e4`\n- `e5d4`\n\n---\n\n## Goal:\nWe must find the best move for Black. The position is very delicate \u2014 it's a king and pawn endgame with only a few pieces left.\n\nWhite's plan is clear: promote the f6 pawn or support it with the king. Black must prevent that.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `e5d6`\nMoves the king toward the center and closer to the f6 pawn. This could be useful in trying to stop the pawn from promoting. However, it also allows White to play `Kg6`, supporting the pawn and preparing to push it.\n\n### 2. `e5f5`\nThis brings the black king closer to the f6 pawn directly. It threatens to capture it if White isn't careful. But after `Kf5`, White can respond with `Kg6`, still keeping control.\n\n### 3. `e5d5`\nCentralizing the king slightly. Not particularly aggressive. Doesn't challenge White's plan effectively.\n\n### 4. `e5e4`\nMoves the king forward, but away from the critical action around the f6 pawn. Seems passive.\n\n### 5. `e5d4`\nAlso moves the king away from the key area. Too far from the action.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most active and effective move is **`e5f5`**.\n\n- It places the black king directly in front of the f6 pawn.\n- It prevents White from easily advancing the pawn without support.\n- It gives Black the best chance to either capture the pawn or force a draw by opposition.\n\nIf White plays `Kg6`, then Black can respond with `Kf4`, maintaining control.\n\nThis move keeps the tension and gives Black the best practical chances.\n\n---\n\n```\ne5f5\n```",

White has a king on f7 and pawns on f6 and g3. Black has only a king on f5.\n\nWhite to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White has two pawns: one on f6 (very close to queening), and one on g3.\n- The White king is on f7 \u2014 extremely well-placed to support the f6 pawn.\n- The Black king is on f5, trying to stop the f6 pawn from queening.\n- If White plays **f6-f7**, the pawn will promote next move unless stopped.\n- However, the Black king can potentially intercept if the White king doesn't support properly.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the **candidate moves**:\n\n#### 1. `f7f8` \u2014 King to f8\nThis moves the king away from the action. Now the f6 pawn is unsupported, and Black can play Kf5-e6, attacking the pawn. Not ideal \u2014 allows counterplay.\n\n#### 2. `f7e8`, `f7g8` \u2014 King to e8 or g8\nWorse \u2014 king moves away from the critical f6 pawn and Black king. Loses control.\n\n#### 3. `f7e7` \u2014 King to e7\nNow the king is no longer in front of the pawn \u2014 Black can play Kf5-e5, then Ke5-f5 again, and potentially draw by keeping the king in front of the pawn. Not optimal.\n\n#### 4. `f7g7` \u2014 King to g7\nKing moves sideways \u2014 now the f6 pawn is still supported, but the king is not optimally placed to prevent Black king from approaching. Still okay, but not best.\n\n#### 5. `g3g4` \u2014 Push the g-pawn\nThis is a waiting move, but it does nothing to promote the f-pawn. It gives Black time to play Kf5-g5 or Kf5-e5, and potentially draw. Not useful \u2014 wastes a tempo.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe key idea is to **support the f6 pawn\u2019s promotion** while keeping the Black king out.\n\nThe best move is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **`f7f8`** \u2014 Wait, no! That moves the king *away* from the pawn!\n\nHold on \u2014 we must be precise.\n\nActually, the correct plan is to **advance the pawn** \u2014 but the pawn on f6 hasn\u2019t moved yet this turn. Wait \u2014 the legal moves list does **not include f6f7** \u2014 why?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check the FEN:\n`8/5K2/5P2/5k2/8/6P1/8/8 w - - 1 85`\n\n- f6 has a White pawn.\n- f7 has the White king.\n- So the pawn on f6 cannot move to f7 \u2014 because the square is occupied by the king!\n\nAh! That\u2019s the key!\n\nSo the only way to free f7 for the pawn is to **move the king off f7**.\n\nNow, which square allows:\n- The king to stay in front of or near the pawn,\n- Prevent the Black king from entering,\n- And allow f6-f7 next move?\n\n\u2705 **`f7f8`** \u2014 King to f8:\n- Frees f7 for the pawn.\n- King stays on the same file \u2014 still controls the queening square (f8).\n- After f6-f7, Black king cannot stop it \u2014 it\u2019s too far away (Kf5).\n- Next move: f6f7, then f7f8=Q \u2014 checkmate or unstoppable promotion.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n1. `f7f8` (White king to f8)\n   - Now Black must respond. Only king moves: Kf5-e5, Kf5-g5, or Kf5-e6.\n2. Then White plays `f6f7` \u2014 pawn advances.\n3. Next move: `f7f8q` \u2014 queen promotes.\n   - Black king is too far to interfere.\n\nAny other king move (like g7, e7, etc.) allows Black to potentially draw by getting closer.\n\n### \u2705 Conclusion:\nThe only move that guarantees a win is to move the king to f8, freeing the path for the pawn to promote.\n\n```\nf7f8\n```",

White has a king on f8 and a pawn on f6\n2. Black has a king on f5 and no pawns\n3. White's pawn is on f6, which is one square away from promotion\n4. Black's king is directly in front of the pawn\n\nThe immediate threat is that White can promote the pawn next move (f6-f7-f8=Q). Black must prevent this.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n- f5g6: moves away from the pawn, allowing f6-f7\n- f5f6: captures the pawn, but this is illegal (king can't capture its own pawn)\n- f5e6: moves away from the pawn\n- f5g5: moves away from the pawn\n- f5e5: moves away from the pawn\n- f5g4: moves away from the pawn\n- f5e4: moves away from the pawn\n\nWait a minute - there seems to be a mistake here. The pawn is on f6, so the only way to stop it is to move to f6. But the move f5f6 is listed as legal, which would be the king capturing its own pawn - this is impossible.\n\nThis suggests there might be an error in the legal moves list. In reality, the only legal move to stop the pawn is f5f6 (king takes pawn), but this would be an illegal move because you can't capture your own pawn.\n\nTherefore, the correct analysis is that Black cannot stop the pawn from promoting. The only legal moves all allow White to promote next move, and then Black cannot stop the resulting queen from checkmating.\n\nHowever, since we must choose a move, the best option is to capture the pawn (even though it's technically illegal in normal chess rules, it's the only way to delay the inevitable):\n\n```\nf5f6\n```\n\nBut since this is actually an illegal move (capturing own pawn), the correct interpretation must be that the pawn is not on f6 but somewhere else. Given the FEN shows the pawn on f6, there's a contradiction.\n\nAssuming the FEN is correct and the pawn is on f6, the only legal move is to move the king away, allowing White to promote:\n\n```\nf5g6\n```\n\nThis is the best option as it keeps the king near the pawn while moving away from the promotion square.",

Black has a king on g6 and a pawn on f6.\n\nCurrent position:\n- White king: f8\n- White pawn: g3\n- Black king: g6\n- Black pawn: f6\n\nWhite to move.\n\n**Goal:** Promote the g-pawn or prevent Black from promoting and win.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the legal moves:\n\n### Legal moves:\n1. `f8g8` \u2014 King to g8\n2. `f8e8` \u2014 King to e8\n3. `f8e7` \u2014 King to e7\n4. `f6f7` \u2014 Pawn to f7\n5. `g3g4` \u2014 Pawn to g4\n\nWait \u2014 hold on: the pawn on f6 is **Black's**, not White's. So `f6f7` is **not a legal move** for White. That must be a mistake in the list of legal moves provided.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check:\n\n- White\u2019s only pawn is on g3.\n- Black\u2019s pawn is on f6.\n- So White cannot play `f6f7`.\n\n\u2705 Therefore, the correct legal moves for White are only:\n- `f8g8`\n- `f8e8`\n- `f8e7`\n- `g3g4`\n\nNow, assess the position:\n\nWhite king is on f8, Black king on g6, Black pawn on f6, White pawn on g3.\n\nThis is a **critical king opposition** situation. White must prevent Black from advancing the f-pawn to f5\u2013f4\u2013f3\u2013f2\u2013f1=Q.\n\nCurrently, Black's king is in front of its pawn \u2014 a dangerous sign. But the White king is deep in the corner.\n\nWhite must activate the king to stop the f-pawn and support the g-pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `f8g8` \u2014 King to g8\n- Now kings are opposite: Kg8 vs Kg6 \u2014 White has the **opposition**.\n- After `f8g8`, if Black plays `Kf5`, White can follow with `Kf7`, cutting off the Black king from the f-pawn.\n- This is a key step toward stopping the f-pawn and preparing to advance the g-pawn.\n\n### 2. `f8e8` \u2014 King to e8\n- Too passive. King moves away from both pawns.\n- Black can play `Kg5` and then `f5`, gaining space and threatening to queen.\n\n### 3. `f8e7` \u2014 King to e7\n- Closer to center, but still not optimal.\n- Black can play `Kg5`, then `f5`, and the White king is too far from the f6 pawn.\n\n### 4. `g3g4` \u2014 Pawn to g4\n- Premature. Does nothing to stop Black\u2019s king from advancing.\n- Black replies `Kg5`, then `f5`, and the f-pawn becomes unstoppable unless the White king intervenes \u2014 but it\u2019s too far.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n**`f8g8`** \u2014 This gains the **diagonal opposition**, puts pressure on the Black king, and prevents Black from making progress without losing control of the f6 pawn.\n\nAfter `f8g8`, Black must either:\n- Retreat (e.g., `Kf5`), allowing `Kf7`, or\n- Stay on g6, leading to zugzwang eventually.\n\nThis is the only move that actively fights for the win and prevents Black from promoting.\n\n```\nf8g8\n```",

Black has a king on f6.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White to move.\n- The White king is on g8, Black king on f6 \u2014 Black is actively trying to stop the g-pawn from promoting.\n- The g3 pawn is two squares away from queening (g3 \u2192 g4 \u2192 g5 \u2192 g6 \u2192 g7 \u2192 g8=Q).\n- Black\u2019s king is dangerously close \u2014 it can reach g7 in two moves (f6\u2013g6\u2013g7), potentially stopping the pawn if not handled correctly.\n- **Critical concept**: White must use the opposition and king activity to support the pawn. The king must get in front of or near the pawn to win.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `g8h8` \u2014 King to h8: retreats, gives space to Black king \u2014 bad.\n- `g8f8` \u2014 King to f8: moves toward the action, supports pawn.\n- `g8h7` \u2014 King to h7: gets closer to the pawn, but may not be optimal.\n- `g3g4` \u2014 Push the pawn: starts the march, but premature without king support?\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. `g8h8` \u2014 King retreats to h8\n- Loses ground. Black plays `Kf6-g6`, then `Kg6-g7`, and will capture or block the pawn. Losing move.\n\n#### 2. `g8f8` \u2014 King to f8\n- Now White king is on f8, one square in front of the pawn. Black must react.\n- If Black plays `Kf6-g6`, then White can play `Kf8-g8`, and now the White king is back on g8 \u2014 no progress.\n- Not ideal \u2014 oscillation risk.\n\n#### 3. `g8h7` \u2014 King to h7\n- Now the White king is adjacent to the pawn and one square closer to the action.\n- This is a **key move** \u2014 it gains the opposition and prepares to support the pawn directly.\n- After `g8h7`, if Black plays `Kf6-g6`, then White plays `g3g4!` \u2014 now the pawn advances with king support.\n- From there, White can play Kh7-g6, and the king escorts the pawn home.\n\nThis is a classic \"king in front of pawn\" technique \u2014 but here, we must first get the king in front.\n\n#### 4. `g3g4` \u2014 Pawn push now\n- Premature. After `g3g4`, Black plays `Kf6-g6`, and now the Black king is on g6 \u2014 it will stop the pawn cold.\n- For example: `g3g4` \u2192 `Kf6-g6`, then `g4g5` \u2192 `Kg6-g7`, and now the Black king is on g7, and the White king is stuck on g8 \u2014 draw by stalemate or inability to make progress.\n\n### \u2705 Best Move:\n**`g8h7`** \u2014 This is the only move that makes progress and avoids a draw. It places the White king one square away from the critical g6 square, ready to escort the pawn after `g3g4`.\n\nThis is a known winning technique in king + pawn vs king endgames: the defending king must not be allowed to reach the queening square or the square in front of the pawn.\n\n```\ng8h7\n```",

The material is equal (both sides have a king and a pawn), but the position is critical.\n\nKey observations:\n1. White's king is on h7, Black's king is on f6\n2. White has a pawn on g3, Black has no pawns\n3. The position is a theoretical draw with correct play, but Black must be extremely careful not to blunder\n\nLegal moves for Black: f6f7, f6e7, f6e6, f6g5, f6f5, f6e5\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n1. f6f7 - This would walk into a potential zugzwang. After Kh7-g7, Black's king is forced to move away and White can make progress with the pawn.\n\n2. f6e7 - This moves the king towards the center but doesn't accomplish much. White can push the pawn.\n\n3. f6e6 - Similar to e7, but slightly more active. Still, White can push the pawn.\n\n4. f6g5 - This is interesting as it attacks the g3 pawn. However, after Kxg5, Black's king is too far from the action.\n\n5. f6f5 - This maintains the opposition but doesn't make progress. White can push the pawn.\n\n6. f6e5 - This is the most active move, centralizing the king and preparing to potentially stop the g-pawn.\n\nThe best move is f6e5 because:\n- It centralizes the king\n- Prepares to potentially stop the g-pawn\n- Maintains flexibility\n- Avoids immediate zugzwang\n- Keeps all options open for Black\n\nOther moves either walk into zugzwang or don't make progress. e5 is the most active and flexible move.\n\n```\nf6e5\n```",

The key question is: Can White promote the pawn?\n\nCurrent pawn is on g3. The black king is on e5 \u2014 relatively close to the pawn, but not optimally placed to stop it.\n\nWhite king is on h7 \u2014 far away, but can assist if needed.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the **legal moves**:\n\n1. `h7h8` \u2014 King to h8. Doesn\u2019t help. Just wastes a move.\n2. `h7g8` \u2014 King to g8. Also passive.\n3. `h7g7` \u2014 King to g7. Slightly better \u2014 centralizing a bit.\n4. `h7h6` \u2014 King to h6. Heading toward the center, but still slow.\n5. `h7g6` \u2014 King to g6. Now this is interesting \u2014 cuts off the black king\u2019s path to the pawn!\n6. `g3g4` \u2014 Pushing the pawn. Immediate central advance.\n\nLet\u2019s assess the critical lines:\n\n### Option: `g3g4`\n- After `g3g4`, Black plays `Ke5-f6` \u2014 now the black king is only two squares from the pawn.\n- Then White must bring the king all the way from h7 \u2014 too slow.\n- Black will capture the pawn or at least prevent promotion.\n- This is **too slow** \u2014 the black king is too close.\n\n### Option: `h7g6` \u2014 King to g6\n- Now the white king is on g6, black king on e5.\n- This move **cuts off the black king\u2019s access to the f-file and g-file squares**.\n- Next, White can play `g3g4` with the king now supporting the pawn from g6.\n- Black king must go to d5 or f5 \u2014 but either way, White can advance the pawn with king support.\n\nThis is a classic **opposition and king activity** idea. The key is to get the white king in front of or near the pawn to support its promotion.\n\nAfter `h7g6`, Black must respond:\n- If `Ke5-f5`, then `g3g4+`, and the white king can reach f7 or g7 to support the pawn.\n- If `Ke5-d5`, then `g3g4`, and the white king moves toward f5 \u2014 now the black king is cut off behind the pawn.\n\nThis is the **only move that wins** \u2014 all others either allow the black king to catch the pawn or lead to a draw.\n\n\u2705 **Best move: h7g6**\n\n```\nh7g6\n```",

Black has the move, and the board looks like this:\n\n- **White King** is on g6.\n- **Black King** is on e5.\n- **White Pawn** is on g3.\n- No other pieces are on the board.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack must try to either:\n- Win by capturing the g3 pawn and promoting their own pawn (if any), or\n- Force a draw if winning is not possible.\n\nBut in this position, **Black has no pawns**, and **White has only one pawn**. So Black's goal is to **prevent White from promoting the g-pawn**, ideally by **capturing it** or **stalemating**.\n\n### Current Legal Moves for Black:\n- `e5e6`\n- `e5d6`\n- `e5d5`\n- `e5e4`\n- `e5d4`\n\nWe'll evaluate each move.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5e6`\n- Black king moves to e6.\n- White king is on g6, so this puts the black king closer to the g3 pawn.\n- After `e5e6`, White can play `g3g4`, advancing the pawn.\n- Black can then go `e6f5`, threatening to approach the pawn.\n- This seems like a good plan: **approach the pawn and try to capture it**.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5d6`\n- King moves to d6.\n- This is a bit too far from the action (g3 pawn).\n- White can push `g3g4` and start advancing the pawn.\n- Black king is too far to stop it effectively.\n- Not ideal.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5d5`\n- King moves to d5.\n- Again, not directly helping in stopping the g3 pawn.\n- White can play `g3g4` and continue advancing.\n- Not optimal.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5e4`\n- King moves to e4.\n- Closer to the center, but still not directly threatening the g3 pawn.\n- White can play `g3g4`, and Black is still too far to stop it.\n- Not ideal.\n\n### Candidate Move: `e5d4`\n- King moves to d4.\n- Too far from the g3 pawn.\n- White can play `g3g4` and advance.\n- Not useful.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\nThe best move is **`e5e6`**, which brings the black king closer to the white pawn on g3. The idea is to **approach and capture the pawn**, preventing its promotion.\n\nIf Black can capture the g3 pawn, the game is a draw (no pawns left for either side). If White promotes, Black may still have drawing chances depending on the position.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5e6\n```",

The key question is: Can White promote the pawn?\n\nWhite king is already very active \u2014 on g6, supporting the g3 pawn. Black king is on e6, central but not yet in front of the pawn.\n\nWhite's goal: Promote the g-pawn.\nBlack's goal: Get the king in front of or near the pawn to stop promotion.\n\nCurrent pawn is on g3. It needs to reach g8 to promote.\n\nWhite king is already on g6 \u2014 extremely well-placed. It can escort the pawn directly.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the legal moves:\n\n1. **g6h7** \u2014 King moves away from the pawn? Bad. Loses control of key squares. Black can then approach with ...Kf7 and stop the pawn.\n2. **g6g7** \u2014 King moves to g7. Now it's directly in front of its own pawn! Blocks the pawn. Not helpful.\n3. **g6h6** \u2014 King moves to h6. Still supports the pawn, but not optimally. Allows Black king to approach via d5\u2013e5\u2013f5\u2013g5.\n4. **g6h5** \u2014 Too far away. King leaves the critical square. Black king can reach g5 easily and stop the pawn.\n5. **g6g5** \u2014 King moves to g5. Now it's one square in front of the pawn. This is excellent \u2014 it keeps the black king out of f5 and h5, and supports the pawn's advance.\n6. **g3g4** \u2014 Pushing the pawn. But king is on g6 \u2014 not directly supporting. Black king can play ...Kf5, then ...Kf4, and race to stop the pawn.\n\nNow, let\u2019s calculate:\n\nIf White plays **g6g5**, the king is on g5, pawn on g3. Black must respond. Best is ...Kf7 or ...Kd5?  \nActually, after **g6g5**, Black\u2019s best try is ...Kf5 to attack the pawn. But then White plays g3g4+, forcing the king to move, and the White king on g5 will dominate.\n\nMore importantly, **g6g5** puts the White king directly in the path of the Black king \u2014 it controls f5, h5, f6, h6, etc. This is a key square.\n\nThis move gains the opposition and prevents Black from getting in front of the pawn.\n\nCompare to **g3g4**:  \nAfter g3g4, Black plays ...Kf5, and now the kings are in a race. But White king is on g6 \u2014 too far. Black king can reach g4 and stop the pawn.\n\nSo **g6g5** is the best move \u2014 it seizes the critical square and ensures the pawn can advance with full support.\n\n\u2705 This is a classic technique in king and pawn vs king: occupy the key square in front of the pawn.\n\n**Final decision:**\n```\ng6g5\n```",

Black's king is on e6\n2. White's king is on g5\n3. White has a pawn on g3\n4. Black has no pawns remaining\n\nThe main strategic considerations:\n- White's g-pawn is a potential threat to promote\n- Black's king needs to either stop the pawn or create counterplay\n- The position is very delicate as both kings are close to the pawn\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n1. e6f7 - moves towards the pawn but might be too slow\n2. e6e7 - similar to f7 but less direct\n3. e6d7 - moves away from the pawn, not helpful\n4. e6d6 - same as d7\n5. e6e5 - moves towards the pawn but might be too slow\n6. e6d5 - same as d6\n\nThe critical calculation is whether Black can catch the g-pawn. Let's analyze the race:\n\nIf Black plays e6f7:\n- White can push g3-g4\n- Black's king would need 3 moves to reach g5 (f7-e6-d5-c5-b5-a5-g5)\n- White's pawn would reach g5 in 2 moves (g4-g5)\n- So Black can just in time to capture the pawn\n\nIf Black plays e6e5:\n- White pushes g3-g4\n- Black's king needs 3 moves to reach g5 (e5-f4-g3)\n- White's pawn reaches g5 in 2 moves (g4-g5)\n- Again, Black just in time\n\nHowever, e6f7 is more direct and keeps the king closer to the pawn's promotion square.\n\nThe best move is to play e6f7, directly heading towards the pawn while maintaining maximum flexibility.\n\n```\ne6f7\n```",

Black has no pieces. The goal for White is to promote the pawn and win. Black\u2019s king is on f7 \u2014 currently preventing the White king from advancing too far and the pawn from advancing safely.\n\nWhite must push the pawn or maneuver the king to support its promotion.\n\n**Legal moves provided:**\n- `g5h6`, `g5h5`, `g5f5`, `g5h4`, `g5g4`, `g5f4`, `g3g4`\n\nOnly one of these is a pawn move: `g3g4`. All others are king moves.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\n### Goal:\nPromote the g-pawn. To do that, White must:\n1. Get the king in front of or near the pawn to support its advance.\n2. Avoid stalemate or draw by 50-move rule or insufficient material.\n\nCurrently, the Black king is on f7 \u2014 it can reach the promotion square (g8) in 1 move if unchecked. So we must be careful.\n\nIf White plays `g3g4`, the pawn advances, but the Black king can then go to e6 or g6, and the White king is on g5 \u2014 too far to support immediate promotion.\n\nBetter plan: **Bring the White king closer to the pawn to escort it to promotion.**\n\nThe best square for the White king is f5 or f6 \u2014 to support g4\u2013g5\u2013g6\u2013g7\u2013g8=Q.\n\nLet\u2019s assess king moves:\n\n- `g5f5` \u2014 centralizes the king, one square closer to supporting the pawn.\n  - After `g5f5`, Black must move the king. Best is `Kf6` or `Ke6`.\n  - Then White can play `g3g4`, and the king is already on f5 \u2014 ready to support the pawn.\n\nCompare to:\n- `g5h5` or `g5h6` \u2014 king moves away from the pawn! Bad.\n- `g5f4` \u2014 too far forward, might allow Black king to cut off the pawn.\n- `g5g4` \u2014 king moves to g4, which is okay, but not optimal \u2014 now the king is on the same file as the pawn, not in front of it.\n\n\u2705 Best move: **`g5f5`**  \nThis places the White king one square away from the ideal f6 square, centralizes it, and prepares to escort the pawn up the board.\n\nIt also avoids wasting a pawn move now \u2014 we want to push the pawn only when the king is optimally placed to prevent Black from blocking or chasing it.\n\n**Final decision:**\n```\ng5f5\n```",

The key is to keep the Black king close enough to stop the pawn or force a draw if possible.\n\n### Current Legal Moves for Black (from f7):\n- `f7g8` \u2013 King moves to g8\n- `f7f8` \u2013 King moves to f8\n- `f7e8` \u2013 King moves to e8\n- `f7g7` \u2013 King moves to g7\n- `f7e7` \u2013 King moves to e7\n\nWe'll evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `f7g8`\n- King moves to g8.\n- This places the Black king one step away from the g3 pawn.\n- White can play `g3g4`, then `g4g5`, etc., pushing the pawn forward.\n- Black king is too far to stop the pawn in time.\n- **Not ideal**.\n\n#### 2. `f7f8`\n- King moves to f8.\n- Similar to above; still too far from the action.\n- **Not ideal**.\n\n#### 3. `f7e8`\n- King moves to e8.\n- Even further from the pawn.\n- **Worse**.\n\n#### 4. `f7g7`\n- King moves to g7.\n- Now the Black king is directly in front of the g3 pawn.\n- White cannot push the pawn without being met by the Black king.\n- For example:\n  - `g3g4` \u2192 `g7g6` (Black king blocks)\n  - `g4g5` \u2192 `g6g5` (capture)\n- This **forces a draw** by opposition and blockade.\n- **Best move**.\n\n#### 5. `f7e7`\n- King moves to e7.\n- Slightly closer than previous options but still not as effective as `f7g7`.\n- Still allows White to make progress with the pawn.\n- **Better than some, but not best**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is **`f7g7`**, which directly blocks the pawn and forces a draw.\n\n```\nf7g7\n```",

Black has only a king on g7.\n\nWhite to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White's king is already quite advanced (f5), and the pawn is on g3 \u2014 two squares from promotion.\n- Black's king is on g7, trying to oppose or catch the pawn.\n- The critical goal for White is to **support the g3 pawn to promote**.\n- If White can get the king in front of the pawn or at least protect it during promotion, it's a win.\n- Black\u2019s king is currently one diagonal away from the queening square (g8), so timing matters.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the given legal moves:\n- `f5e6` \u2014 moves king toward center, but away from pawn support.\n- `f5g5` \u2014 approaches the pawn file, supports g3-g4-g5-g6-g7-g8.\n- `f5e5` \u2014 centralizes king, but not optimal for pawn support.\n- `f5g4` \u2014 gets closer to the pawn, but maybe too fast?\n- `f5f4`, `f5e4` \u2014 move away from key diagonal support.\n- `g3g4` \u2014 pushes pawn immediately \u2014 tempting, but is it safe?\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most promising ones:\n\n#### 1. `g3g4` \u2014 Immediate pawn push\n- After `g3g4`, Black plays `Kg7-f7` (centralizing to oppose).\n- Then White must bring king in: `Kf5-f6` or `Kf5-g5`.\n- But if White plays `g3g4`, Black can play `Kg7-f7`, and now:\n  - If White pushes `g4g5`, Black plays `Kf7-f8` \u2014 now the king can reach g8 in time.\n  - So premature pawn push might allow Black to catch up.\n\n#### 2. `f5g5` \u2014 King moves to g5, supporting g3-g4\n- This is a classic king-in-front technique.\n- After `f5g5`, Black must respond:\n  - If `Kg7-f7`, then White plays `g3g4` \u2014 now the king is perfectly placed on g5 to support the pawn all the way.\n  - Black cannot stop both the pawn and the king.\n\nLet\u2019s test this line:\n1. `f5g5` (White)\n   - Black: `Kg7-f7` (only reasonable move)\n2. `g3g4` \u2014 now pawn advances with king on g5\n   - Black: `Kf7-e6` (trying to intercept)\n3. `g4g5` \u2014 push again\n   - Black: `Ke6-f7`\n4. `g5g6+` \u2014 check!\n   - Black: `Kf7-e7`\n5. `g6g7` \u2014 promotes!\n   - Black: `Ke7-f7`\n6. `g7g8Q` \u2014 queen wins easily.\n\nPerfect! The king on g5 ensures the pawn promotes.\n\n### Why not `g3g4` first?\nBecause after `g3g4`, Black plays `Kg7-f7`, and now if White plays `Kf5-g5`, Black can play `Kf7-g7` \u2014 staying in the square of the pawn. Then:\n- `g4g5` \u2192 `Kg7-g8` \u2014 now king is on promotion square, draw!\n\nSo timing matters: **King must lead, not pawn.**\n\n### Best Move:\n`f5g5` \u2014 brings the king to the ideal square to support the pawn\u2019s advance. This is the only move that guarantees a win here.\n\n```\nf5g5\n```",

The material is equal (both sides have a king and a pawn), but the position is critical.\n\nKey observations:\n1. White's king is on g5, Black's king is on g7\n2. White has a pawn on g3\n3. Black has no pawns remaining\n4. The position is extremely delicate - any wrong move could lead to a draw or even loss\n\nLegal moves for Black: g7h8, g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7f7\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n1. g7h8: This moves the king to the corner. While it might seem safe, it actually allows White to make progress by pushing the g-pawn. After g3-g4, White's king can support the pawn's advance.\n\n2. g7g8: This is a waiting move, but it doesn't improve Black's position. White can still push the pawn.\n\n3. g7f8: This moves the king away from the pawn, which is dangerous. White can push g3-g4 and then g4-g5, creating a passed pawn.\n\n4. g7h7: This keeps the king in front of the pawn, but it's passive. White can still make progress with the pawn.\n\n5. g7f7: This is the most active move. It brings the king closer to the center and prepares to potentially stop the g-pawn's advance. After g7f7, if White plays g3-g4, Black can respond with f7-e6, getting closer to the pawn.\n\nThe best move is g7f7 because:\n- It actively approaches the center\n- It prepares to stop the g-pawn's advance\n- It maintains flexibility\n- It doesn't allow White any immediate progress\n\nOther moves either allow White to make progress or are too passive.\n\n```\ng7f7\n```",

White\u2019s goal is to promote the g-pawn, and the black king is trying to stop it.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully:\n\n```\n8/5k2/8/6K1/8/6P1/8/8 w - - 10 92\n```\n\nWhite king is on g5, Black king on f7. The g3 pawn needs to advance to g8 to promote. The key is to support the pawn with the king while preventing the black king from getting in front of it.\n\nCurrent legal moves for White (from the list provided):\n- g5h6\n- g5h5\n- g5f5\n- g5h4\n- g5g4\n- g5f4\n- g3g4\n\nWe must choose the best move to win \u2014 this is a theoretical win for White with precise play.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- The pawn must be allowed to advance to g4, g5, g6, etc.\n- The White king must stay in front of or near the pawn to support it.\n- We must avoid stalemate or letting the black king get in front of the pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate candidate moves:\n\n#### 1. **g3g4** \u2014 This advances the pawn. But is it safe?\n- After g3g4, Black plays Kf6, and now the black king is close to the pawn. White must respond with Kf4 or Kf5 to support. This is playable, but not the most precise.\n\n#### 2. **g5f5** \u2014 King moves toward the center and closer to the pawn.\n- Now the White king is on f5, Black must respond with Ke7 or Kf6.\n- If Black plays Kf6, then White plays g4, and now the king is ideally placed on f5 to support the pawn\u2019s advance.\n- This is a classic technique: king in front of the pawn, controlling the critical squares.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n- 1. g5f5 Ke7\n- 2. g3g4 Kf7\n- 3. g4g5 Ke7\n- 4. g5g6 Kf8\n- 5. Kf6 Kg8\n- 6. g7 Kf7\n- 7. g8=Q+ \u2014 win.\n\nIf after 1. g5f5, Black plays Kf6, then:\n- 2. g3g4! (now the pawn advances with king support)\n- Black must move Kf7 or Ke5 \u2014 either way, White plays Kf5 or Ke5 to support the pawn.\n\nThis is the most accurate and safest path to win.\n\nOther king moves like g5h5 or g5h6 are away from the pawn \u2014 they waste time and risk letting the black king reach g6 and stop the pawn.\n\n### \u2705 Best Move: **g5f5**\nThis centralizes the king, supports the pawn, and maintains the win with no risk of draw.\n\n```\ng5f5\n```",

The position is:\n\n- Black king on f7\n- White king on f5\n- White pawn on g3\n\nThe key features:\n1. The white pawn is on g3, which is a passed pawn but not yet advanced enough to promote immediately.\n2. The kings are in opposition with the white king on f5 and black king on f7.\n3. Black has several legal moves: f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7g7, f7e7.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n1. f7g8: Moves the king to the corner. This would allow white to play Kf5-g5, getting closer to the pawn. Not ideal.\n2. f7f8: Similar to g8, but keeps the king on the f-file. Still allows white to approach the pawn.\n3. f7e8: Moves the king away from the pawn. This seems passive and allows white to make progress.\n4. f7g7: Maintains the opposition and keeps the king near the pawn. This seems strong.\n5. f7e7: Also maintains the opposition but moves the king away from the pawn's promotion path.\n\nThe best move is f7g7 because:\n- It maintains the opposition against the white king\n- It keeps the king near the passed pawn\n- It prevents the white king from advancing (if Kf5-g5, then Kg7-h6 maintains the opposition)\n- It's the most active move that doesn't allow white to make progress\n\nOther moves either allow white to make progress or are too passive.\n\n```\nf7g7\n```",

The key question is: Can White win?\n\nWhite\u2019s goal is to promote the g3 pawn. Black\u2019s king is on g7 \u2014 directly in front of the pawn on the same file \u2014 which is a classic defensive setup.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the position:\n\n- White king is on f5 \u2014 quite close to supporting the pawn.\n- Black king is on g7 \u2014 directly opposing the pawn.\n- The pawn is on g3, two squares from promotion.\n\nWhite must advance the pawn or bring the king closer. But note: if White pushes the pawn too early (g3\u2013g4), Black can step in front (g7\u2013g6), and if the kings are not well-placed, it could be a draw.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the legal moves:\n- `f5e6`, `f5g5`, `f5e5`, `f5g4`, `f5f4`, `f5e4` \u2014 king moves\n- `g3g4` \u2014 pawn push\n\nWe must be cautious: if White plays `g3g4` now, Black replies `g7g6`, and now the Black king is in front of the pawn on g5. Then if White tries to go around, Black can hold the draw by opposition.\n\nInstead, White should first improve the king\u2019s position. The ideal plan is:\n1. Bring the king to h5 or h6 to support the pawn from the side.\n2. Then push the pawn when the Black king cannot stay in front.\n\nCurrently, the kings are in \"distant opposition\" \u2014 White on f5, Black on g7. If White can get to h5, it will be able to outflank the Black king.\n\nLet\u2019s test candidate moves:\n\n### 1. `f5g5` \u2014 King to g5\nThis moves toward the pawn, but allows Black to play `g7f7`, and now the kings are in direct opposition on the f-file. That could be problematic \u2014 Black can maintain the draw by mirroring.\n\n### 2. `f5e5` \u2014 King to e5\nToo far away from the pawn \u2014 gives Black time to centralize or even attack the pawn.\n\n### 3. `f5g4` \u2014 King to g4\nNow this is interesting. White king moves closer to the pawn, and threatens to support it directly. Black must respond.\n\nIf White plays `f5g4`, Black must move \u2014 likely `g7g6` to stay in front of the pawn.\n\nThen White can play `g4g5`, gaining ground. Now the White king is on g5, Black king on g6 \u2014 White has the opposition! Then:\n- Black must move: `g6f6` or `g6h6`\n- White follows with `g5f5` or `g5h5` accordingly, gaining the critical square in front of the pawn.\n\nEventually, White can push the pawn safely.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is `f5g4` safe?\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. `f5g4`  \n   Black must play `g7g6` (to stay in front of the pawn)  \n2. `g4g5`  \n   Now Black must leave the g-file: say `g6f6`  \n3. `g5f5` \u2014 White king now controls the critical square in front of the pawn (f6)  \n   Black king must stay close: `f6e6`  \n4. `g3g4` \u2014 now push the pawn!  \n   Black king must go to d5 or e5 \u2014 White king follows and supports the pawn all the way.\n\nYes \u2014 this plan wins.\n\nCompare to `g3g4` immediately \u2014 that allows `g7g6`, and now the Black king is on g6, White king on f5 \u2014 Black has the opposition and can hold the draw.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to **outflank the Black king first**.\n\n### \u2705 Best move: `f5g4`\n\n```\nf5g4\n```",

The position is:\n\n- Black king on f6\n- White king on f4\n- White pawn on g3\n- No other pieces on the board\n\nThe key features:\n1. The white pawn is on g3, which is a passed pawn but not yet advanced enough to promote immediately.\n2. The kings are in opposition with the white king on f4 and black king on f6.\n3. The position is very delicate as any misstep could lead to a draw or even a loss.\n\nLegal moves for Black: f6g7, f6f7, f6e7, f6g6, f6e6\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n1. f6g7: This moves the king away from the center and gives White more space. Not ideal.\n2. f6f7: This maintains the opposition but doesn't make progress. White can then advance the pawn.\n3. f6e7: This moves the king towards the center but away from the pawn. Not helpful.\n4. f6g6: This maintains the opposition and keeps the king near the pawn. Good option.\n5. f6e6: This moves the king towards the center but away from the pawn. Not helpful.\n\nThe best move is f6g6 because:\n- It maintains the opposition against the white king\n- It keeps the black king near the white pawn\n- It prevents White from advancing the pawn immediately\n- It prepares to potentially capture the pawn if White isn't careful\n\nThis move maintains the balance and gives Black the best chance to either win or force a draw depending on White's response.\n\n```\nf6g6\n```",

Let's break it down:\n\n### Position Analysis:\n- **White King**: f4  \n- **White Pawn**: g3  \n- **Black King**: g6  \n- **White to move**\n\nThe goal is to promote the pawn on g3 to g8, while preventing the Black king from stopping it.\n\nCurrent pawn is on g3, needs to reach g8. Black king is on g6 \u2014 very close to the pawn\u2019s path. White king is on f4 \u2014 ideally placed to support the pawn.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- The **opposition** matters here \u2014 if White can get the king in front of the pawn and control the key squares, the pawn will promote.\n- If the Black king reaches f6, e6, or f5 in time, it can stop the pawn.\n- White must **support the pawn\u2019s advance** while keeping the Black king at bay.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `f4e5`, `f4g4`, `f4e4`, `f4f3`, `f4e3`, `g3g4`\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. `g3g4` \u2014 advancing the pawn\n- Pawn moves to g4. Black king can then go to f6 or f7.\n- After `g3g4`, Black plays `g6f6`, and now the king is directly in front of the pawn \u2014 likely a draw unless White can regain the opposition.\n- This is premature \u2014 **not best**.\n\n#### 2. `f4e5` \u2014 centralizing the king\n- King moves to e5. Now White king is closer to the action.\n- Black must respond. If `g6f7`, then White can play `e5f5`, gaining the opposition.\n- This move **controls the critical squares** (e6, f6) and prepares to escort the pawn.\n\n#### 3. `f4g4` \u2014 king moving toward the pawn\n- King to g4. But now Black king can play `g6f6`, and White king is not in front \u2014 it\u2019s on the same file as the pawn, not supporting it directly.\n- This loses the **opposition** and allows Black to potentially block the pawn.\n- **Worse than e5**.\n\n#### 4. `f4f3` \u2014 king moving toward pawn\n- Too passive. Black king can just wait or approach. Doesn\u2019t gain ground.\n\n#### 5. `f4e4` / `f4e3` \u2014 sideways or backward king moves\n- These are clearly inferior \u2014 they don\u2019t help the pawn and give Black time to centralize.\n\n### Best Move:\n**`f4e5`** \u2014 this is the key move. It places the White king on e5, controlling the critical squares in front of the pawn (e6, f6), and prepares to support the pawn\u2019s advance to g4, g5, etc., while maintaining the opposition.\n\nAfter `f4e5`, if Black plays `g6f7`, then White replies `e5f5` \u2014 now the White king is in front of the pawn and has the opposition. From there, the pawn can advance safely.\n\nThis is a textbook king and pawn vs king win, and `f4e5` is the correct first step.\n\n```\nf4e5\n```",

Black has the move, and the board looks like this:\n\n- **Black King** is on g6.\n- **White King** is on e5.\n- **White has a pawn** on g3.\n- All other pieces are off the board.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack must either:\n- Win by capturing the g3 pawn and promoting their own pawn (if any), or\n- Force a draw if winning is not possible.\n\nBut in this position, **Black has no pawns**, and **White has one pawn on g3**. So Black's only hope is to **prevent the White pawn from promoting** and **possibly force a draw**.\n\n### Current Legal Moves for Black (from g6):\n- `g6h7`\n- `g6g7`\n- `g6f7`\n- `g6h6`\n- `g6h5`\n- `g6g5`\n\nWe need to evaluate each move and see which one gives Black the best chance to **prevent White from promoting the pawn** or **force a draw**.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move Analysis:\n\n#### 1. `g6h7` \u2013 King moves to h7\n- This puts the black king in the corner.\n- It distances the king from the critical area around the g3 pawn.\n- Not ideal; gives White more freedom.\n\n#### 2. `g6g7` \u2013 King moves to g7\n- Centralizes the king slightly.\n- Still not close enough to stop the g3 pawn.\n- White can play `g3-g4`, then `g4-g5`, etc., with support from the king.\n\n#### 3. `g6f7` \u2013 King moves to f7\n- Gets closer to the center.\n- Still too far to stop the g3 pawn effectively.\n\n#### 4. `g6h6` \u2013 King moves to h6\n- Slightly better than h7.\n- Still not close enough to the action.\n\n#### 5. `g6h5` \u2013 King moves to h5\n- Now the king is within striking distance of the g3 pawn.\n- From h5, the king can potentially intercept the pawn if it advances.\n- This is a strong candidate.\n\n#### 6. `g6g5` \u2013 King moves to g5\n- This is the **most active** move.\n- Places the black king directly in front of the white pawn.\n- If White plays `g3-g4`, Black can respond with `g5-g4`, capturing the pawn.\n- This is the **best move** to **prevent promotion** and **force a draw**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`g6g5`**, placing the black king in front of the white pawn and preventing its advance. This forces a draw, as Black can capture the pawn if it advances.\n\n```\ng6g5\n```",

The current position in FEN is:\n\n**8/8/8/4K1k1/8/6P1/8/8 w - - 18 96**\n\nThis means:\n- White king is on e5\n- Black king is on g5\n- White pawn is on g3\n- No other pieces\n- It's White to move\n\n### Goal:\nWhite has a king and a pawn vs. a lone black king. The pawn is on g3 \u2014 two squares away from queening. Black's king is on g5, dangerously close to stopping the pawn.\n\nWhite must advance the pawn carefully while using the king to support it and prevent the black king from capturing it or blocking it permanently.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the given legal moves:\n- `e5e6` \u2014 King marches forward\n- `e5d6` \u2014 King moves diagonally toward the pawn\n- `e5d5` \u2014 King moves left\n- `e5e4` \u2014 King moves down (away from pawn!)\n- `e5d4` \u2014 King moves left-down\n- `g3g4` \u2014 Pawn push to g4\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\nThe key idea is to **support the g-pawn's advance** while preventing Black from capturing it or blocking on g4.\n\nIf White plays `g3g4` now, Black can reply with `Kg5-g6`, and now the black king is directly in front of the pawn \u2014 a potential draw if White isn't careful.\n\nInstead, White should first **improve the king's position** to support the pawn\u2019s advance. The ideal plan is to get the white king to f5 or f6 to escort the pawn to promotion.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\n- `e5e6`: King moves to e6 \u2014 too passive, doesn\u2019t help the pawn directly.\n- `e5d6`: King moves away from the action \u2014 bad.\n- `e5d5`: Also away \u2014 no.\n- `e5e4`: Retreat \u2014 no.\n- `e5d4`: Worse \u2014 no.\n- `g3g4`: Tempting, but after `Kg5-g6`, White must play Kd5 or Ke6 to prevent the draw \u2014 risky.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **White is in a zugzwang-like situation where the king must lose a tempo to gain opposition**.\n\nActually, the best move is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **`e5e6`**\n\nWhy?\n- It prepares to support the pawn by getting closer to f6 or f7.\n- If Black responds with `Kg5-f6`, then White plays `Ke6-f6` \u2014 opposition and now the pawn can advance safely.\n- If Black plays `Kg5-h5`, then White plays `g3g4`, and now the black king is out of the square of the pawn \u2014 it will queen.\n\nLet\u2019s test:\n- 1. `e5e6` Kg5-f6  \n  2. `e6-f6`! \u2014 now the white king controls the queening square, and the pawn can advance:  \n  2... any move, then `g3g4` followed by `g4g5`, etc. \u2014 pawn queens.\n\nIf instead:\n- 1. `e5e6` Kg5-h5  \n  2. `g3g4+` Kh5-h6  \n  3. `e6-f6`! \u2014 now the king supports the pawn again, and Black can't stop it.\n\nAny other king move delays progress and risks allowing Black to get in front of the pawn.\n\n### \u2705 Best Move:\n```\ne5e6\n```",

The position is very delicate \u2014 it's a king and pawn endgame with only kings and one pawn left (White's g3-pawn).\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `g5h6` \u2013 King moves to h6  \nThis places the black king on the edge of the board. It gives White more freedom to advance the g-pawn and centralize the king. Not ideal.\n\n### 2. `g5g6` \u2013 King moves to g6  \nThis is a strong centralizing move. It brings the black king closer to the critical area around the g3-pawn and supports potential opposition play. This is likely the best move.\n\n### 3. `g5h5` \u2013 King moves to h5  \nThis keeps the king on the edge and doesn't help much in controlling the g3-pawn or supporting a draw. Weak.\n\n### 4. `g5g4` \u2013 King moves to g4  \nThis is a very active move. It directly attacks the g3-pawn and threatens to capture it. However, after `g5g4`, White can respond with `e6f5` (or similar), and then Black may not be able to stop the pawn from queening.\n\nLet\u2019s look at that line:\n\n#### Line: `g5g4 e6f5 g4f4 g3g4 f4g4`  \nNow Black has captured the pawn and can try to hold a drawn king vs king endgame.\n\nBut is this safe?\n\nAfter `g5g4`, White plays `e6f5`, then `g4f4`, then `g3g4`, and now `f4g4` captures the pawn.\n\nSo yes, this line leads to a drawn position.\n\nHowever, is there a better way?\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Analysis:\n\n- `g5g6` is the most flexible and keeps maximum control over the center.\n- It avoids immediate pawn capture and allows Black to maneuver for a draw.\n- It also prevents White from easily advancing the pawn without opposition.\n\nIf Black plays `g5g6`, White cannot make progress without losing the pawn.\n\nThus, **`g5g6`** is the best move here.\n\n---\n\n```\ng5g6\n```",

Avoid.**\n\n#### 2. `e6e5` \u2014 King retreats toward center\n- Allows Black to play `Kg6-f5`, and now the Black king can control the queening square (g1) and stop the pawn.\n- This is a **mistake** \u2014 White must not allow the Black king to get in front of the pawn.\n\n#### 3. `e6d5`, `e6d6`, `e6d7` \u2014 King moves left\n- These move away from the pawn \u2014 bad plan. The king must support the pawn, not abandon it.\n\n#### 4. `e6e7` \u2014 King to e7\n- This moves the king away from the pawn and toward the edge \u2014 not helpful. Black king can then play `Kg6-f6` and control the queening square.\n\n#### \u2705 5. `e6d6` \u2014 Wait, no \u2014 we already rejected that.\n\nHold on \u2014 we missed something.\n\nLet\u2019s look again:\n\nThe **only move that makes progress** is:\n\n### \u2705 `e6f5` \u2014 But wait! That move is **not listed** in the legal moves.\n\nHmm \u2014 that\u2019s suspicious. Why isn\u2019t `e6f5` a legal move?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check the legality of `e6f5`:\n- From e6 to f5 \u2014 that\u2019s a king move, one square diagonally.\n- Is the square f5 attacked or occupied? No \u2014 it\u2019s empty.\n- Is the king in check after the move? No.\n- So why is it not in the legal moves list?\n\nWait \u2014 the legal moves provided are:\n`e6e7, e6d7, e6d6, e6e5, e6d5, g3g4`\n\nThis suggests that `e6f5` is **not legal** \u2014 but that can\u2019t be unless the engine or input is wrong.\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s look at the **move history**:\n```\ng5f5, f7g7, f5g4, g7f6, g4f4, f6g6, f4e5, g6g5, e5e6, g5g6\n```\nThis shows that the kings have been maneuvering. After `e5e6`, Black played `g5g6` \u2014 so now both kings are on the 6th rank: White on e6, Black on g6.\n\nSo the position is:\n- White king: e6\n- Black king: g6\n- White pawn: g3\n\nNow, if White plays `e6f5`, the king moves to f5 \u2014 one square away from the Black king on g6. That\u2019s legal \u2014 kings can be one square apart diagonally.\n\nSo why is `e6f5` not in the legal moves list?\n\nThis suggests the legal moves list may be incomplete or incorrect \u2014 but we must work with what we\u2019re given.\n\nGiven the legal moves provided, the only one that makes sense is:\n\n### \u2705 `e6e5`? No \u2014 that retreats.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s reevaluate the position with precise king opposition.\n\nCurrent kings: White Ke6, Black Kg6 \u2014 they are two files apart, same rank.\n\nWhite must **approach the pawn** \u2014 the only way to win is to get the king to f5 or f6 to support the pawn.\n\nThe only legal move that brings the king closer to the pawn is:\n\n### \u2705 `e6f6` \u2014 But that\u2019s also not in the list!\n\nThis is a problem \u2014 neither `e6f5` nor `e6f6` is listed as legal.\n\nLet\u2019s check if `e6f6` is legal:\n- From e6 to f6 \u2014 one square right.\n- Square f6 is empty.\n- After move, kings are on f6 and g6 \u2014 adjacent files, same rank \u2014 legal.\n- So why not in the list?\n\nThis suggests the legal moves list is **wrong** \u2014 but we must choose from the given list.\n\nSo from the given legal moves:\n- `e6e7` \u2014 away from pawn\n- `e6d7` \u2014 away\n- `e6d6` \u2014 away\n- `e6e5` \u2014 retreats\n- `e6d5` \u2014 away\n- `g3g4` \u2014 pushes pawn, but Black responds `Kg6-f6` and stops it\n\nAll of these either retreat or fail to make progress \u2014 except one:\n\n### Wait \u2014 what happens after `g3g4`?\n\n1. `g3g4`  \n   Black must respond. If Black plays `Kg6-f6`, then White plays `Ke6-f5` \u2014 now the king is in front of the pawn and supports it!\n\nBut `e6f5` must be legal \u2014 it\u2019s just not in the list. So perhaps the legal moves list is truncated or incorrect.\n\nBut since we must choose from the given list, and we know that `g3g4` is the only move that forces the issue \u2014 and if Black responds correctly, White can then play `e6f5` next (if legal), then win.\n\nHowever, if `e6f5` is not legal for some reason (e.g., it\u2019s a bug), then `g3g4` is still the best move because it forces the Black king to react \u2014 and if Black doesn\u2019t play optimally, White wins.\n\nBut in perfect play, after `g3g4`, Black must play `Kg6-f6` \u2014 and then White must play `Ke6-f5` to win.\n\nSo if `e6f5` is not legal \u2014 that would be a serious issue.\n\nBut given the FEN and the position, `e6f5` must be legal.\n\nTherefore, the legal moves list is likely incomplete \u2014 but we must choose from the given list.\n\nAmong the given moves, the **only one that creates a threat and forces Black to respond precisely** is:\n\n### \u2705 `g3g4`\n\nThis is the only move that advances the pawn and creates a winning opportunity \u2014 assuming White can follow up with `e6f5` next.\n\nIf `e6f5` is not legal, then this position is a draw \u2014 but that\u2019s unlikely.\n\nSo, based on the assumption that the legal moves list is incomplete but we must choose from it, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3g4\n```",

The position is:\n\n- White king on e6\n- Black king on g6\n- White pawn on g4\n- Black has no pawns\n\nThe key features:\n1. White's king is very active and close to Black's king\n2. White's pawn on g4 is advancing and could become dangerous\n3. Black's king is currently blocking the pawn's advance\n\nLegal moves for Black: g6h7, g6g7, g6h6, g6g5\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n1. g6h7: Moves the king away from the pawn, allowing White to play g5 and advance the pawn. This would be bad as White's pawn could promote.\n\n2. g6g7: Moves the king up but doesn't address the pawn. White could play g5, and after Kg7, White can play Kf6 attacking the king.\n\n3. g6h6: Similar to h7, moves the king away from the pawn's path. White can play g5 and advance.\n\n4. g6g5: This is the most interesting move. It blocks the pawn's advance directly. After g6g5, White's king must move (Kf6 or Ke6), and Black can then capture the pawn with Kxg4.\n\nThe best move is clearly g6g5 as it:\n- Blocks the pawn's advance\n- Maintains control of the position\n- Prevents White's pawn from promoting\n- Keeps the king active\n\nOther moves would allow White to advance the pawn and create a passed pawn that could promote.\n\n```\ng6g5\n```",

The key question is: Can White promote the pawn?\n\nWhite king is on e6, Black king is on g5 \u2014 very close to the pawn. The pawn is on g4, and the queening square is g8.\n\nWhite must be extremely careful \u2014 if the Black king reaches g7 or g8 before the pawn promotes, it will be a draw or even a loss.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the **candidate moves**:\n\n### 1. e6-f7\nKing moves away from the pawn \u2014 dangerous. Black plays Kf6 or Kg6 and can easily stop the pawn. \u274c\n\n### 2. e6-e7  \nKing moves up the e-file. But now the king is moving away from supporting the pawn. Black plays Kg6, then Kf6, and will intercept the pawn. \u274c\n\n### 3. e6-d7  \nKing retreats \u2014 worse than above. Black king advances and stops the pawn. \u274c\n\n### 4. e6-d6  \nKing moves left \u2014 away from the action. Black plays Kg6, then Kf6, and the pawn is lost. \u274c\n\n### 5. e6-e5  \nKing moves down \u2014 this seems counterintuitive, but let\u2019s see:\n- After Ke5, Black must respond.\n  - If ...Kg6, then White plays Ke6 again \u2014 back to the same position. That\u2019s a waste of a move.\n  - If ...Kh4, then White can play Kf5, and now the king is approaching the pawn from the front \u2014 dangerous for Black.\nBut this doesn\u2019t make progress \u2014 it just repeats. \u274c\n\n### 6. e6-d5 \u2705  \nThis is the **only move that makes progress**.\n\nWhy?\n- After **Ke6-d5**, White king heads toward the pawn via the critical d5-e4-f5 path.\n- Now, if Black plays ...Kg6, White replies **Kd5-e4!**, then Ke4-f5, cutting off the Black king from the queening square.\n- This is a classic technique in king and pawn endgames: the White king must get in front of the pawn to win.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n1. **e6d5**  \n   Now Black must respond:\n   - If **...Kg6**, then **Ke4!** (next move), then Kf5, and the Black king is too far to stop g4-g5-g6-g7-g8=Q.\n   - If **...Kh4**, then **Kd4!**, followed by Ke3, Kf4 \u2014 again, White king supports the pawn and wins.\n\nThis is the only winning plan. All other king moves either lose the pawn or allow the Black king to catch it.\n\nTherefore, the best and only correct move is:\n\n```\ne6d5\n```",

Black has a king on g5, and White has a king on d5 and a pawn on g4. It's Black to move.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack must prevent the White pawn from promoting while trying to either capture it or force a draw.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- The White pawn is on g4, and if it advances to g5, it will be supported by the White king.\n- Black's king is currently on g5, directly in front of the pawn.\n- If Black moves away from g5, White can play g5 and then promote the pawn with support from the king.\n- Black must keep the king in front of the pawn to prevent its advance.\n- Black's king cannot allow the pawn to reach g5 without being captured.\n\n### Legal Moves for Black:\n- `g5h6`\n- `g5g6`\n- `g5f6`\n- `g5h4`\n- `g5g4`\n- `g5f4`\n\nWe must choose the move that best prevents White from making progress.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move Analysis:\n\n#### 1. `g5g4` \u2013 Captures the pawn.\n- This removes the pawn entirely.\n- After this, the position is a pure king endgame.\n- With both kings in opposition, and no pawns left, the game is a **draw**.\n- This is a **safe and effective move**.\n\n#### 2. `g5f4` \u2013 King moves toward the center.\n- Allows White to play `g4g5`, advancing the pawn.\n- Then White can support the pawn with the king.\n- This gives White a clear path to promotion.\n- **Not good**.\n\n#### 3. `g5f6` \u2013 King moves away diagonally.\n- Again, allows `g4g5`.\n- White gains space and can push the pawn.\n- **Bad**.\n\n#### 4. `g5h4` \u2013 King moves to the side.\n- Allows `g4g5` again.\n- White advances the pawn.\n- **No good**.\n\n#### 5. `g5g6` \u2013 King moves up one square.\n- Still blocks the pawn.\n- But White can respond with `Kd5-c5`, preparing to support the pawn.\n- Black may still be able to hold, but not as cleanly as capturing the pawn.\n\n#### 6. `g5h6` \u2013 King moves to the corner.\n- Allows `g4g5`.\n- White can then push the pawn.\n- **Worse**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`g5g4`**, which captures the pawn and leads to a drawn king endgame. There is no risk of losing, and no chance for White to make progress.\n\n```\ng5g4\n```",
