After Bxc3, Black can develop with Nf6, attacking e4 and preparing to castle.\n\n7. **Long-term Strategy**:\n   - By playing ...dxc3, Black opens the d-file and can develop pieces more freely.

After ...Qe7, White can play f3, attacking the knight. After ...Nf6, White can play Nc6, attacking the queen and threatening a fork. This line is dangerous for Black.\n   - ...Bb4+: This check develops a piece and could force White to block with c3 or Bd2, which helps Black develop and possibly castle queenside.\n   - ...e5: This move attacks the d4 knight and challenges White's center. If White plays Nf3, Black can continue development.\n\n5. **Strategic Considerations**:\n   - Black needs to develop pieces and prepare to castle.\n   - ...Bb4+ is a developing move with tempo.\n   - ...e5 is a strong central break.\n\n6. **Move Selection**:\n   - ...Nxe4 is risky due to tactical reasons.\n   - ...Bb4+ is safe, develops a piece, and puts pressure on White.\n   - ...e5 is also strong, but ...Bb4+ is more forcing.\n\n7. **Best Move**:\n   - ...Bb4+ is the best move.
