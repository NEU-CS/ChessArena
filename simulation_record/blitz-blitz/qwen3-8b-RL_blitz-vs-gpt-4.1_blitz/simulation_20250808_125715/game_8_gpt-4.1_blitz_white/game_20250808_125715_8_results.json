All pieces are on their original squares. The main opening moves for White are 1.e4 and 1.d4, both controlling the center and opening lines for the queen and bishop. Other options include 1.Nf3 and 1.c4, but 1.e4 and 1.d4 are considered the most principled.\n\n1.e4 opens lines for both the queen and bishop and is the most popular opening move, leading to open games and rapid development. 1.d4 is also strong, leading to closed or semi-closed games.\n\nBetween 1.e4 and 1.d4, 1.e4 is slightly more aggressive and statistically scores a bit better at all levels. There are no tactical threats to consider at this stage, so the choice is strategic.\n\nTherefore, the best move is 1.e4.\n</think>\n<answer>\n```\ne2e4\n```\n</answer>",

Nf3: Attacks the e5 pawn, develops a piece, and prepares kingside castling.\n2. Nc3: Develops a piece, supports e4, but does not attack e5 directly.\n3. Bc4: Develops a bishop, targets f7, but leaves e4 unprotected.\n4. d4: Opens the center, but Black can respond with exd4, leading to exchanges.\n5. f4: King's Gambit, aggressive but risky.\n\nLet's evaluate:\n- Nf3 is the most classical and solid move, attacking e5 and developing a piece.\n- Nc3 is solid but less aggressive.\n- Bc4 is playable, but Nf3 is more principled.\n- d4 is playable, but after exd4, White must recapture with the queen or knight, which can lead to early queen exposure.\n- f4 is aggressive, but not the main line.\n\nLong-term strategy: Develop pieces, control the center, prepare for castling.\nShort-term tactics: Attack e5, avoid exposing the queen early.\n\nConclusion: The best move is 2.Nf3, attacking e5, developing a piece, and preparing for kingside castling.\n</think>\n<answer>\n```\ng1f3\n```\n</answer>",

Nxe5: Captures the pawn on e5. If Black responds with Nxe4, White can play Qe2, attacking the knight and threatening to win it back.

Nc3: Develops another piece, supports e4, and prepares for d4.\n3. d4: Immediately challenges the center. After exd4, e5 is attacked, but White can recapture with the knight.\n4. Bc4: Develops the bishop to an active square, eyes f7.\n5. Bb5: Pins the knight on c6 if Black plays Nc6.\n\nLet's calculate Nxe5:\n1. Nxe5 Nxe4\n2. Qe2 d5\n3. d3 Nf6\n4. Nc6 bxc6\n5.
