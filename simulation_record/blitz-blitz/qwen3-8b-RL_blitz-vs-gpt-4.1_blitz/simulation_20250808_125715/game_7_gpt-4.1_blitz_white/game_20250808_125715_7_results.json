The FEN is: rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2\n   - It's White to move.\n   - Black has played ...d5, challenging the center after 1.e4 d5.\n\n2. This is the Scandinavian Defense (Center Counter Defense).\n\n3. White's main options:\n   - 2.exd5: Capturing the pawn, the main line, opening the center and challenging Black's idea.\n   - 2.e5: Advancing the pawn, but this is less common and gives Black easy development.\n   - 2.Nc3: Defending the pawn, but allows Black to exchange and equalize.\n   - 2.d3: Passive, blocking the bishop.\n\n4. Let's evaluate:\n   - 2.exd5 is the main line, and gives White a slight advantage by opening the center and forcing Black to recapture, often with the queen, which can be attacked by Nc3.\n   - 2.Nc3 allows Black to play dxe4, and after Nxe4, Black can play Nf6, with equality.\n   - 2.e5 is not challenging enough, and Black can play c5 or Nc6 with a comfortable game.\n\n5. Therefore, the best move is 2.exd5.\n\n6. Short-term tactic: Capture the pawn, open the center, and prepare to develop with tempo.\n   Long-term strategy: Maintain central control, develop pieces rapidly, and exploit Black's queen if it comes to d5.\n\nConclusion: The best move is exd5.\n</think>\n<answer>\n```\ne4d5\n```\n</answer>",

Black has just played ...e5, and White has a pawn on d5.

Other pawn moves (not possible except for a2-a3, h2-h3, etc.)\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. d5xe6 (en passant): Captures the e5 pawn, opens the d-file, and gives White a central pawn majority. Black can recapture with f7-f6 or develop pieces, but White will have a slight space advantage and a lead in development.\n\n2. Nf3: Develops a piece, attacks e5, but allows Black to play e4, gaining space.\n\n3. Nc3: Develops a piece, but does not challenge the center immediately.\n\n4. d5-d6: Advances the pawn, but Black can play Bxd6 or cxd6, and White loses the pawn.\n\nEn passant is a rare opportunity and usually strong when it opens the position and wins a pawn. Here, d5xe6 is the best move, as it wins a pawn and opens the position for White's pieces.\n\nLet's check for tactical issues:\n- After d5xe6, Black cannot immediately recapture, and White is up a pawn.\n- White can follow up with Nf3, Bc4, etc., developing rapidly.\n\nTherefore, the best move is d5xe6 (en passant).\n\nUCI notation: d5e6\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n```\nd5e6\n```\n</answer>",

When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nYour reasoning process and answer must be enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n\n<answer>\n```\n<move>\n```\n</answer>\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n\n<answer>\n```\ne2e4\n```\n</answer>\n\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n\nYou will get evaluated following Evaluation Scoring Rules:\n# Format Score:\n- ```<move>``` is the most important tag, if you output your move inside ```, score 0.5\n- If you output special tokens like <think>, each token will add 0.125 points\n- So, if you follow the format exactly as above, format score is 1\n- Otherwise, score 0\n\n# Correctness Score:\n- If your final move is legal but not good enough, score 3\n- An additional move quality score, where the score is higher when your move is better, with a maximum score of 6 and a minimum score of 0.\n- So, if you get a best move, correctness score is 9\n- Otherwise, score 0\n\nYou will get the final score as their sum. Only when you have got the format score can you potentially obtain the correct score. \nYou should try your best to analysis the chess board and get the optimal move.\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"
