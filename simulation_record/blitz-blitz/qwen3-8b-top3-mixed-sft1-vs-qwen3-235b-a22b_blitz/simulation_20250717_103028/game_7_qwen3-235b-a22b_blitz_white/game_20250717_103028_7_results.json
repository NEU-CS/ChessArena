White has played e2-e4 (King's Pawn opening) and Black has responded with e7-e5 (Scandinavian Defense)\n3. White's King is unusually placed on e2 (likely due to a previous move like Ke1-f2)\n4. Black has all pieces in their starting positions except the e-pawn\n\nKey observations:\n- White's King is exposed on e2, which is a significant vulnerability\n- Black has several developing moves available\n- The most forcing moves would be knight developments that attack the exposed King\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Nf6 (g8f6) - develops the knight and attacks the e4 pawn, but doesn't directly threaten the King\n2. Nc6 (b8c6) - develops the knight but doesn't create immediate threats\n3. Qh4 (d8h4) - threatens mate on f2, but White can defend with g3\n4. Bc5 (f8c5) - develops the bishop but doesn't create immediate threats\n5. Qf6 (d8f6) - interesting, develops the queen while attacking f2\n\nAfter careful consideration, Qf6 (d8f6) is the most promising:\n- It develops the queen to an active square\n- It creates an immediate threat of Qxf2#\n- White's only defense would be g3, but then Black can play Qxe4+ with a strong attack\n- It maintains all of Black's options while putting maximum pressure on White\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate. The queen move is the most forcing and creates the most problems for White.\n\n```\nd8f6\n```",

Black has all pieces developed except the knight on g8 and bishop on f8\n\nKey considerations:\n- White's king safety is severely compromised on d2\n- Black should prioritize exploiting this vulnerability\n- The most forcing way to attack is with Qh4+, which would be devastating\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n- d8h4 (Qh4+) is the most aggressive option, immediately threatening mate\n- Other queen moves don't create immediate threats\n- Knight moves don't capitalize on White's exposed king\n- Pawn moves don't address the immediate opportunity\n\nAfter Qh4+:\n- If White plays Kc1, then Qxe4 wins material\n- If White plays Ke1, then Qxe4 is still strong\n- White has no good way to defend against this\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd8h4\n```",

White has moved their king already (to e3!) and has not castled, while Black has played ...e5 and ...Qh4 \u2014 a very aggressive setup.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **White King on e3** is exposed in the center.\n- **Black Queen on h4** is already deep in White\u2019s territory, attacking g4 and pressuring the kingside.\n- White has not developed any pieces yet except possibly the knight if it just came to e2.\n- Black has also not fully developed but has launched an early queen sortie.\n- The position is extremely dangerous for White due to the king being stuck in the center and the black queen already exerting pressure.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite must either:\n1. Get the king to safety as quickly as possible.\n2. Launch a counterattack that threatens faster material gain or checkmate than what Black can deliver.\n3. Avoid blunders that allow immediate tactical shots from Black.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### 1. **e3\u2013f3 (King retreat)**\n- This moves the king away from the center and opens up space for development.\n- It avoids immediate threats like ...Qxg4+.\n- However, the king remains in the open.\n\n#### 2. **e3\u2013d3**\n- Centralizes the king slightly and prepares potentially to connect with the rook via Kd1.\n- Still risky because of ...Qg5 or ...Qxg4+ followed by Qxf2 etc.\n\n#### 3. **e3\u2013e2**\n- Retreats the king closer to the back rank, possibly preparing to castle queenside or play Kd1.\n- Slower, but safer.\n\n#### 4. **b1\u2013c3**\n- Developing a piece with tempo consideration.\n- But king still in danger.\n\n#### 5. **g1\u2013f3**\n- Develops a knight, defends e5 pawn indirectly, and prepares to castle.\n- Seems most natural given the need to develop and protect the king.\n\n#### 6. **f1\u2013c4**\n- A developing move, but exposes the king further to checks from ...Qg5+ or ...Qh4 again.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Evaluation:\n\nWe must prioritize **king safety** above all else. While developing is important, moving a knight to f3 helps both in terms of development and potentially enabling castling later.\n\nBut the **single most urgent issue is protecting the king**.\n\nAmong the king moves, **e3\u2013f3** seems best:\n- It gets off the open e-file.\n- Avoids immediate checks like ...Qxg4+ (as the queen would then be pinned against the king).\n- Keeps options open for future development.\n\nLet\u2019s test this idea:\n\nAfter **e3\u2013f3**, the king is now on f3.\n- Black cannot play ...Qxg4+ safely because the white queen can recapture with check: Qxg4+.\n- Also, the king is stepping toward the corner, which may help in connecting with the rook eventually.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nThe safest and most logical move in this precarious position is:\n\n```\ne3f3\n```",

White's king is on f3, which is somewhat exposed\n2. Black's queen is already on h4, putting pressure on White's position\n3. The most aggressive move would be to bring the queen closer to White's king\n\nThe move h4g4 (Queen moves to g4) seems particularly strong because:\n- It brings the queen closer to White's king\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n- It doesn't give up any squares or pieces\n- It keeps the initiative with Black\n\nOther options like h4h5 or h4g5 would be less direct in attacking White's king.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh4g4\n```",

It is a forced and highly advantageous move because it removes Black's queen from the board at no material cost (other than king mobility).\n2. **f3e3**: This move retreats the king, but it allows Black to keep their queen active and potentially increase pressure on the center.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- `f3g4` is clearly the best move. Capturing the queen is an overwhelming material gain (Black loses their most powerful piece), and it eliminates immediate threats around the White king.\n- There is no danger in playing `f3g4` \u2014 Black cannot deliver check or initiate a forced mate in this position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlay `f3g4` to capture Black's queen immediately.\n\n```\nf3g4\n```",

It keeps the king active and may open lines for an attack. However, pushing pawns in front of an uncastled (or semi-exposed) king can be risky if the attack doesn't materialize.\n\nBut here, White already has the king on g4 \u2014 might as well commit and try to make something out of it.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `g4f5` \u2013 capture on f5\nThis removes a defender from e5 and opens the f-file. But now the white king is on f5, more exposed, and Black can respond with ...Ng4 or ...Nc6 targeting the king.\n\nSeems risky without enough compensation yet.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `g4h4` \u2013 moving king up along h-file\nThis prepares potential rook support from h1 and keeps the king high. Still aggressive but slightly less committal than g5.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `g4h3` \u2013 heading toward h3\nThis looks like a retreat toward relative safety (h3 is often a safe square for the king after fianchettoing). Might be too passive here.\n\n---\n\n### 5. `g4g3`, `g4f3` \u2013 retreating king\nThese are clearly defensive and concede the initiative. Not ideal when we have a lead in development and an active king.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Evaluation:\n\nThe most aggressive and logical continuation is **`g4g5`**, pushing the pawn to maintain pressure and force Black to deal with a quick kingside initiative. This also limits the mobility of Black's knight on f6 and could lead to tactical opportunities.\n\nWhite should aim to follow up with moves like Qh5, Bc4, Nf3, and possibly castle queenside while launching a strong attack.\n\n---\n\n```\ng4g5\n```",

Key observations:\n   - White's king is vulnerable, so we should look for checks or threats\n   - The knight on f6 is already attacking the king\n   - We have several possible moves that could increase pressure\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - f6g4: Knight check that forks king and queen\n   - f6e4: Capturing the pawn with check\n   - f8b4: Developing the bishop with pressure on c3\n   - e8e7: Connecting rooks and preparing to castle\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n   - f6g4+ looks very strong as it:\n     * Gives check to the exposed king\n     * Forks the king and queen\n     * After Kxg4, we can play Qd5+ with a discovered attack\n   - f6e4+ is also good but less forcing\n   - Other moves don't capitalize on White's exposed king\n\n5. Potential lines after f6g4+:\n   - If Kxg4, then Qd5+ Kh4 (or Kf4), and we have strong pressure\n   - If Kh6, then Qd5+ g5, and we can continue attacking\n   - In all cases, we maintain strong initiative\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move is f6g4+, which immediately exploits White's exposed king position.\n\n```\nf6g4\n```",

Let's break it down:\n\n- **Black to move**\n- White has already castled short (King on g1, Rook on h1), but Black hasn't moved their king or rooks yet.\n- Black's king is still in the center, but not under immediate threat.\n- White's king is on **g5**, which is extremely exposed \u2014 this is a major tactical vulnerability.\n- Black has a knight on **h2**, which is deep in White's territory and attacking the rook on f1.\n- Black also has a bishop on f8, which is currently blocked in by pawns.\n- Black has many legal moves, including developing pieces, moving the king, or even pushing pawns.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- The white king on g5 is dangerously advanced and could be a target for a quick attack.\n- Black has a knight on h2 that can capture the rook on f1 with check: `h2f1`.\n- After `h2f1`, White must recapture with the queen (`Qxf1`) or another piece if available.\n- This would open up the f-file and give Black a strong initiative.\n- Other developing moves like `b8c6` or `f8e7` are reasonable, but they don't exploit the immediate tactical opportunity as strongly as capturing the rook.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n- `h2f1` \u2013 Knight takes rook with check; opens lines and gives Black a strong attack.\n- `b8c6` \u2013 Develops the knight, supports d4 or e5.\n- `f8e7` \u2013 Develops the bishop, prepares to castle.\n- `e8e7` \u2013 King move, possibly preparing to castle.\n- `h8g8` \u2013 Castling long, but risky with the king so far from safety.\n\n### Best Move:\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move here is **`h2f1`** \u2014 the knight captures the rook with check. This exploits the exposed white king and opens up the f-file for Black's rook, giving Black a clear advantage.\n\n---\n\n```\nh2f1\n```",

First, let's understand the board state:\n   - Black is to move (indicated by \"b\" in the FEN)\n   - White's king is on h5 (very exposed!)\n   - Black has a knight on f1 (attacking white's king)\n   - White's queen is on e1, rook on a1, bishop on c1, knight on g1\n   - Black has a rook on h8, bishop on f8, knight on b8, pawns on a7,b7,c7,d7,e5,g7,h7\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's king is extremely vulnerable on h5\n   - Black's knight on f1 is already attacking the king\n   - Black has several promising moves that could lead to mate or major material gain\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - f1g3: Forking queen and rook, but white can defend\n   - f1h2: Direct attack on king, but not immediately winning\n   - f1d2: Interesting, but not as forcing\n   - h8g8: Preparing to bring rook into attack\n   - f8e7: Developing bishop, but slow\n   - f8c5: Bishop checks the king!\n\n4. The most forcing and winning move is f8c5+, which:\n   - Delivers check to the white king\n   - After Kh4 (only legal move), we can play Nf1-g3+ forking queen and rook\n   - Or after Kg4, we have Nh2# (mate!)\n\n5. Let's verify:\n   - 1... Bc5+ 2. Kh4 (only move)\n   - Then 2... Ng3+ 3. Qxg3 Rxh2 winning the rook\n   - Or if 2. Kg4, then 2... Nh2# is mate!\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf8c5\n```",

First, let's understand the position:\n   - Black is to move (indicated by \"b\" in FEN)\n   - White's king is on g5, which is very exposed\n   - Black has a bishop on c5 that's eyeing the white king\n   - Black's queen is on f1, which is a very active position\n   - White has a pawn on e4 that's blocking the bishop's diagonal\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's king is in a precarious position on g5\n   - Black has multiple ways to attack the white king\n   - The most forcing moves would be checks or threats against the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - c5f2: Bishop moves to f2, attacking the king and threatening mate on g1\n   - f1g3: Queen moves to g3+, delivering check\n   - f1h2: Queen moves to h2+, delivering check\n   - c5e3: Bishop moves to e3+, delivering check\n\n4. Evaluating the best option:\n   - c5f2 looks very strong as it threatens mate on g1 (Qxg1#)\n   - White has no good way to prevent this:\n     - If Kxf2, then Qxg1#\n     - If Qxf2, then Qxg1#\n     - Other moves don't prevent the mate\n   - Other checking moves allow White some defensive resources\n\n5.

Candidate moves to consider:\n- f2h4: Bishop takes rook, but after Kxh4 we lose material\n- f2g3: Bishop retreat, but not very active\n- f1g3: Knight moves to a better square, attacking the rook\n- h8g8: Rook moves to a more active file\n- e8g8: Castling to safety\n\n4.

The white king on g5 can march toward f6 or h6 to deliver checkmate.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with this crushing move.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nh7g7\n```",

Bxg1`  \n  `Kxg1`  \n  `Nxh1`  \n  And Black wins a rook for a bishop and knight \u2014 a great trade.\n\n#### 2. `g3h1` \u2013 Knight captures on h1\n- This is a **discovered check** as well, but only effective if the bishop is still on f2.\n- If played without first moving the bishop, it just wins a rook with check, but not as strong as the above.\n\n#### 3. `f2e1` \u2013 Bishop captures queen\n- This is a blunder because the queen is protected by the rook on g7.\n- So `f2e1` would be met with `Rxg7`, and Black loses the bishop for nothing.\n\n#### 4. `f2g1` \u2013 Best Move\n- As explained earlier, this is a **discovered check** setup.\n- It wins material decisively.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe best move here is **`f2g1`**, delivering a **discovered check** and winning material.\n\n```\nf2g1\n```",

But since this is a legal move list-based analysis, we must choose from the provided moves.\n- The white king is safe, and White has many developed pieces.\n- Black\u2019s king is stuck in the center or castled kingside (but the rook on h8 hasn't moved yet \u2014 judging by the castling rights \"kq\", both sides still have castling rights, though it may be artificial).\n- White has a **strong initiative**, and the position is ripe for tactical play due to the exposed black king and weak dark squares around it.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nFrom the list:\n- `g5f6+` \u2013 captures on f6, opens up lines, possibly leading to quick attack.\n- `e1g3` \u2013 brings queen into the attack, targeting g3, eyeing the g-file and h3-c8 diagonal.\n- `e1f2` \u2013 supports h4 push, centralizes queen.\n- `g7g8q` \u2013 promotes the rook on g7 to queen? Wait \u2014 no, that's not correct. Rook on g7 is still a rook; promoting would only occur if a pawn reached the 8th rank. So `g7g8` is likely an illegal move unless there's a pawn on g7. It appears to be a rook moving from g7 to g8, which is possible but less effective than other options.\n\nSo let's re-evaluate the legality and usefulness of each move.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Key Moves:\n\n#### \u2705 Best Move: `e1g3`\nThis move develops the queen to g3, where it exerts pressure along the g-file and targets g7, supporting the rook already on g7. It also threatens mate on g7 if Black isn\u2019t careful. Additionally, it eyes the h3\u2013c8 diagonal, which could become very dangerous if Black\u2019s king stays in the center or tries to castle short.\n\nIt also prepares potential sacrifices like Bxh2+ followed by Qxh2 or Rh1 ideas.\n\n#### Other Strong Contenders:\n\n- `g5f6+`: This removes a key defender (the knight) and opens up the g-file further. However, it might allow Black to regroup or defend better after Kxf6, giving up some of White\u2019s momentum.\n- `e1e3`, `e1f2`: These are slower developing moves, not as aggressive.\n- `g7g6`: Retreats the rook, reducing pressure.\n- Pawn moves (`d2d4`, etc.): Not urgent here.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhite has a strong initiative and must strike while the iron is hot. The best way to continue is with:\n\n```\ne1g3\n```\n\nThis move maximizes pressure on the kingside and sets up for a powerful attack. It's aggressive, logical, and consistent with the demands of the position.\n\n```\ne1g3\n```",

First, let's understand the material balance and piece positions:\n- White has a rook on g7, queen on g3, king on g5, and pawns\n- Black has a rook on h8, bishop on g1, king on e8, and pawns\n- White's king is exposed but Black's king is also vulnerable\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's rook on g7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's bishop on g1 is pinned to the king by White's queen\n- White's queen is eyeing the h2 pawn which is undefended\n- Black's rook on h8 is currently passive\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Qxh2 winning a pawn\n- White could also consider Rg8+ forcing the king to move\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 - defending against Rg8+ but leaves h-file open\n- g1h2 - unpins the bishop and defends h2\n- e8f8 - moves the king away from potential checks\n- b8c6 - develops the knight but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n5.

First, let's understand the board state based on the FEN:\n- Black's king is at e8 (in check from White's rook at g8)\n- White has a rook on g8 giving check to Black's king\n- Black has a bishop on h2 attacking White's queen on g3\n- White's king is at g5\n- Black has a rook on h8\n\n2. Legal moves given are e8e7 and h8g8:\n- e8e7: King moves to e7, getting out of check\n- h8g8: Rook captures the checking rook on g8\n\n3. Evaluating h8g8:\n- After Rxg8, White's queen is attacked by Black's bishop on h2\n- White would likely play Qxh2, but then Black has Kxg8\n- This leads to a roughly equal material position (Black has bishop vs White's knight)\n- However, White's king is more active in this scenario\n\n4. Evaluating e8e7:\n- King moves to e7, still under attack from White's rook on g8\n- White can then play Rg7+ forcing the king to move again\n- This seems to lead to worse consequences for Black\n\n5. Better alternative:\n- Actually, after h8g8 Rxg8, White's queen is attacked by the bishop\n- White must take the bishop (Qxh2), then Black takes the rook (Kxg8)\n- This leads to a roughly equal position where Black has bishop vs knight\n- The material is roughly balanced, and Black's king is slightly safer\n\n6. Conclusion:\n- h8g8 is the better move as it:\n  - Removes the immediate check\n  - Leads to a balanced material position after exchanges\n  - Avoids worse king positions\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh8g8\n```",

Let's understand the key features of the position:\n\n---\n\n### King Safety:\n- **Black king is on e8**, which is relatively safe for now, but not fully castled.\n- **White king is on f6**, an extremely advanced and dangerous position. It is deep in Black's territory and could be a target.\n\n---\n\n### Material:\n- Both sides have equal material.\n- White has a queen on g3, which is very active.\n- Black has a rook on g8 (semi-open file), and a bishop on h2 \u2014 this last piece is pinned to the king by the white queen.\n\n---\n\n### Tactical Observations:\n- The **Black bishop on h2 is pinned** by the White queen on g3. Moving it would allow Qxh2#.\n- Therefore, **h2g3** is a legal move, but it loses the bishop immediately to Qxh2#.\n- So, **h2g3 is not a good move** unless there's some tactical compensation \u2014 which there isn't here.\n- Other moves like moving the rook on g8 or the king from e8 might help unpin or improve coordination.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nLet\u2019s evaluate some of the legal moves:\n\n#### 1. `h2g3` \u2013 Bad, as explained above.\n#### 2. `g8g7` \u2013 Rook to g7, defends against Qxg7# ideas, supports possible ...f5 or ...f6.\n#### 3. `g8f8` \u2013 Rook to f8, prepares to double rooks on the f-file or support king-side play.\n#### 4. `e8f8` \u2013 King to f8, gets off the back rank and avoids potential back-rank mates.\n#### 5. `b8c6` \u2013 Knight development, but not urgent in this sharp position.\n#### 6. `e8d8` \u2013 King to d8, centralizing and preparing to connect rooks.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\nThe most logical move is **`e8f8`**, moving the king off the back rank and away from danger. This also allows for better coordination of pieces and avoids any immediate threats.\n\nIt\u2019s a quiet, prophylactic move that improves king safety without weakening anything.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```\ne8f8\n```",

This could be dangerous if Black can coordinate an attack.\n- White's Queen on g3 is **threatening h4**, **f4**, and could potentially deliver check on e5 or f4.\n- There is a possible **checkmate threat** if White can exploit the open g-file and weak back rank for Black.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nLet's consider the most forcing moves first:\n\n#### 1. `g3g8` \u2013 Queen to g8, attacking the Black Rook on f8 with check.\nThis is a **very strong move**. It puts pressure on the Black King and threatens immediate material gain.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the line:\n- `1. Qg8+ Rf8` \u2013 Forced.\n- Then `2. Qxf8+ Kxf8` \u2013 Black loses a rook and the King is stuck in the center.\n- Now White has a material advantage and can push pawns or activate remaining pieces.\n\nThis line looks **very favorable** for White.\n\n#### 2. `g3g7` \u2013 Queen to g7, attacking f8 and threatening mate.\n- `1. Qg7 Rf7` \u2013 defends.\n- `2. Qh8+ Ke7` \u2013 Black escapes the immediate danger.\n\nNot as strong as `Qg8`.\n\n#### 3. `g3e5` \u2013 Queen to e5, attacking the King and threatening checkmate.\n- `1. Qe5+ Kf7`\n- `2. Qh5+` \u2013 continues pressure, but not decisive.\n\n#### 4. `f6f5` \u2013 King moves forward.\n- Very risky. King is already exposed; moving it further into danger.\n\n#### 5. `g3f4` \u2013 Queen to f4+, checking the King.\n- `1. Qf4+ Ke7`\n- Then `2. Qc1` or similar \u2013 not as strong.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe move **`g3g8`** (Queen to g8) is the most forcing and strongest move on the board right now. It wins material and gives White a decisive advantage.\n\n```\ng3g8\n```",

Any checks or threats must be evaluated first.\n\n### Immediate Threats:\n- Black could play ...Bg2+, which would give check to the White king on f6. That would be very dangerous \u2014 possibly leading to a forced sequence where White loses control.\n- Therefore, moving the king away from f6 is critical.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move with this in mind:\n\n#### `f6e7` \u2013 King retreats into the center\n- This removes the king from g6 and h6, which are both attacked by ...Rh8 potentially.\n- However, it keeps the king deep in enemy territory and still quite exposed.\n- It also attacks the black rook on d8.\n- But after `...Rxe7`, White no longer has a king escape square like e6 or d6 safely.\n- Risky.\n\n#### `f6g5` \u2013 King to g5\n- Exposes king further; g5 is a light square and accessible to black pieces.\n- Also allows ...h6+ possibly, forcing the king to h6 or g6, both dangerous squares.\n- Not safe.\n\n#### `f6f5` \u2013 King steps forward to f5\n- Still in danger; e5 is open for a potential ...Qe7+ or other checks.\n- Doesn\u2019t solve long-term king safety.\n\n#### `b1c3` \u2013 Develop knight\n- A developing move, but ignores the danger to the king.\n- Too slow.\n\n#### `b1a3` \u2013 Knight to a3\n- Also slow, same issue as above.\n\n#### `g2g3` \u2013 Move g-pawn\n- Could help create an escape route for the king toward h2 and g1.\n- Might prepare Kf5-g4-h3.\n- Seems useful for king safety.\n\n#### `d2d3` \u2013 Central pawn move\n- Slows down king escape.\n- Not helpful immediately.\n\n#### `c2c3`, `b2b3`, `a2a3` \u2013 Queenside pawn moves\n- Slow and irrelevant to king danger.\n\n#### `g2g4` \u2013 Pushes pawn forward\n- Opens path for king to g3/h2.\n- May help king safety.\n\n#### `d2d4`, `c2c4`, `b2b4`, `a2a4` \u2013 More pawn moves\n- Again, too slow given the danger to the king.\n\n---\n\n### Best Plan:\nThe top priority is **king safety**. We need to get the king out of the center and away from checks.\n\nTwo promising options:\n- **`g2g3`** \u2013 Prepares a safe retreat path: Kf6 \u2192 g5 \u2192 h2 \u2192 g1.\n- **`g2g4`** \u2013 Similar idea, gives king space to go to g3/h3.\n\nBetween them, **`g2g3`** is slightly better because:\n- It keeps g4 available if needed later.\n- It prepares for a more flexible king retreat.\n\nAfter `g2g3`, the king can retreat via g5 to h2, avoiding any immediate checks from the bishop or rook.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ng2g3\n```",

It has limited escape squares.\n- **Black has a bishop developed** (g3), targeting the white king.\n- **Black's king is safely castled** on g8.\n- **White has no rooks developed**, and the queen is not out.\n- **White\u2019s pieces are still in their starting positions**, except for the knight on b1 and the king.\n- **The pawn structure is mostly intact for both sides**, but White\u2019s king-side is very weak due to the advanced king position.\n\n### Immediate Tactical Danger:\nWhite\u2019s king on f6 is extremely exposed. Black has a bishop on g3, which could potentially deliver checks or support an attack.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate possible moves:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### 1. **f6e7** \u2013 King retreats to e7\n- This removes the king from some danger, but places it in the center of the board still.\n- Now the king is on a dark square, same as Black\u2019s bishop (g3).\n- Still vulnerable to checks and potential back-rank threats.\n\n#### 2. **f6g5** \u2013 King advances toward g5\n- Brings the king closer to the h-file.\n- Exposes it further to potential ...Rh8+ ideas if Black develops a rook.\n- Also allows ...Bh2 pinning the g-pawn if White plays h2-h3.\n\n#### 3. **f6f5** \u2013 King steps forward one square\n- Keeps the king on the f-file.\n- Still within range of the bishop and potential rook battery.\n\n#### 4. **b1c3** \u2013 Develop knight\n- Develops a piece.\n- But ignores the immediate danger to the king.\n- Likely loses to tactical shots like ...Bd6+ or ...Rf8+ followed by ...Bc5+\n\n#### 5. **b1a3** \u2013 Knight development to a3\n- Less natural development.\n- Again, doesn't address the king's vulnerability.\n\n#### 6. **d2d3 / c2c3 / b2b3 / a2a3 / d2d4 / c2c4 / b2b4 / a2a4**\n- These are all pawn moves.\n- None address the king safety issue directly.\n- Some may slightly improve pawn structure, but none reduce the danger to the king.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nGiven the imminent danger to the White king, we must prioritize **king safety above all else**.\n\nBetween the three king moves:\n\n- **f6e7** gets the king off the 6th rank, away from the edge, and avoids the immediate check on f8.\n- While not ideal, it gives the king more space and options than staying on f6 or moving to g5.\n\nMoving to **e7** also opens up potential for later Kb1-Rook activation via d1, though that's long-term.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6e7\n```",

White has advanced their king to e7, which is deep into Black's territory. The material is roughly equal, but both sides have serious positional issues:\n\n- White\u2019s king is extremely exposed on **e7**.\n- Black\u2019s king is in the center, also not safe.\n- Black has a bishop on h2 (a powerful diagonal), and it's targeting the white king via the g1-a7 diagonal.\n- White has a pawn on e4, and pawns on d2, c2, b2, a2 \u2014 all still on their starting squares.\n- Black has pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7 \u2014 also mostly unmoved.\n- Black has a rook on a8, knight on b8, bishop on c8 \u2014 all undeveloped or poorly placed.\n\nWhite must act quickly because Black can exploit the weak white king with checks.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\nWe are playing as **White**, and our king is on **e7**, under threat of discovered checks from the black bishop on h2 via ...Bg1+ (if any piece moves off the first rank).\n\nHere are the legal moves again:\n\n- `e7e8` \u2013 King promotes (impossible, that square is occupied by a black rook)\n- `e7d8` \u2013 King retreats to d8\n- `e7f6` \u2013 King goes forward to f6\n- Other moves (`b1c3`, `b1a3`, etc.) are developing pieces, but they expose the king further or waste time when the king is in danger.\n\nSo we focus on the **only two viable king moves**:\n\n### 1. `e7d8` \u2013 Retreat to d8\n\n- This removes the king from some immediate threats.\n- However, Black could play ...Bf4+, gaining tempo and continuing pressure.\n- Also, the king remains stuck in the middle and surrounded by danger.\n\n### 2. `e7f6` \u2013 Advance toward safety\n\n- This gets the king out of the line of sight of the bishop on h2.\n- It also opens up potential escape routes via g5 or g6 if needed.\n- Importantly, it avoids any discovered check along the g1-a7 diagonal.\n- It centralizes the king slightly better.\n\nBetween these two, **`e7f6`** seems clearly superior.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision:\n\n```\ne7f6\n```",

White's king is on f6 \u2014 quite advanced and possibly vulnerable.\n- **Material**: Roughly equal material, but Black has a bishop on h2 (attacking the white king), while White has a knight on b1 and rook on a1 that are not yet active.\n- **White's King is Exposed**: On f6, with limited pawn cover. This is a major tactical opportunity.\n- **Black's Bishop on h2** is currently attacking the white king directly. It can be used to deliver check or support a mating net.\n- **Black's Rook on a8** is passive; needs activation.\n- **Black's Knight on b8** is undeveloped.\n- **Central Pawns**: Both sides have central pawns, but Black has a central pawn on e5 which could be useful in supporting a breakthrough or attack.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `g8h8`, `g8f8`, `g8h7` \u2013 These are mostly defensive or repositioning. Not ideal when you have attacking chances.\n\n#### Knight from b8:\n- `b8c6`, `b8a6` \u2013 Developing the knight. `b8c6` looks more natural and supports central control.\n\n#### Bishop on h2:\n- `h2f4`, `h2g3`, `h2g1` \u2013 All involve moving the bishop. `h2f4` attacks the white king again and threatens mate ideas.\n    - `h2f4+` gives check and forces the white king to move.\n    - After `h2f4+`, White must respond, likely with `Kg5` or `Ke7`.\n\n#### Pawns:\n- `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `d7d5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5` \u2013 Most are slow and don't contribute to an immediate attack.\n\n---\n\n### Tactical Idea:\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move is:\n\n### `h2f4+`\n\nThis puts the black bishop on f4, giving **check** to the white king on f6. The white king has very few safe squares:\n\n- `Kg5` is possible, but then `Rh8#` is mate.\n- `Ke7` is also possible, but then `Rg8#` is mate.\n- So this move creates a strong threat of immediate checkmate.\n\nEven if White finds a way to escape, Black gains a tempo and keeps up the pressure.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\nh2f4\n```",

It gives White something tangible (a knight) in return for the risk.\n\nAlso, after `f6e7`, the king is on e7, which is less exposed than f6 and may provide better chances to coordinate with other pieces in the future.\n\nThus, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6e7\n```",

Bxg3  \n2. hxg3 (forced)  \nNow the h-file opens up, and Black can follow up with ...Rh8, ...Ng6, etc., with strong pressure on the White king.\n\nAlternatively, after **Bxg3**, if White tries to recapture with the h-pawn, then Rh8+ follows with devastating effect.\n\nSo **Bxg3** is a strong tactical shot.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\nf4g3\n```",

There are no immediate threats of material gain for White, and trying to play aggressively without securing the king would be reckless.\n- Looking at the legal moves, most of them involve moving the king out of the center or improving the position of the knights or pawns.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n1. **d8e8** \u2013 Moving the king to e8, possibly preparing to connect the rooks or transfer to the kingside.\n2. **d8c8** \u2013 King retreats to c8, away from the dangerous h2-b8 diagonal.\n3. **d8e7** \u2013 Centralizing the king slightly, but still in danger.\n4. **d8c7** \u2013 Also a retreat, but exposes the king to more danger if Black plays ...Ba6.\n5. **b1c3 / b1a3** \u2013 Developing a knight, but too risky given the danger to the king.\n6. **Pawn moves (d2d3, c2c3, etc.)** \u2013 These are slow and don't address the king\u2019s danger.\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe priority is to **get the king off the dangerous diagonal** that Black's bishop controls (**h2-b8**). That means getting off of **d8** immediately.\n\n- **d8c8** gets the king off that diagonal and into a safer file.\n- It also opens the possibility of playing **Rd1** next to start connecting rooks or preparing counterplay.\n- Other king moves like **d8c7** or **d8e7** keep the king exposed to potential checks or pins.\n- Moving the king to **e8** could be playable, but it keeps the king in the center and doesn\u2019t fully resolve the danger.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move here is **d8c8**, retreating the king to a safer square and beginning the process of reorganizing White's position.\n\n```\nd8c8\n```",

Black has a rook on a8, knight on b8, and king on g8. White has a very advanced king on c8 (which is deep in Black's territory), and Black has a bishop on h2, which is quite active.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is dangerously close to the center and could potentially promote a pawn if not contained. Black must be careful not to allow White's king to infiltrate further or support a passed pawn.\n\nBlack\u2019s pieces are somewhat passive, but the bishop on h2 is well-placed, eyeing the long diagonal and can be used for tactical purposes.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nWe are given the list of legal moves in UCI notation:\n\n- **King moves**: `g8h8`, `g8f8`, `g8h7`, `g8g7`\n- **Knight moves**: `b8c6`, `b8a6`\n- **Bishop moves**: `h2f4`, `h2g3`, `h2g1`\n- **Pawn moves**: `f7f6`, `d7d6`, `c7c6`, `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `f7f5`, `d7d5`, `c7c5`, `b7b5`, `a7a5`\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation:\n\n### King Safety:\n- Black's king is on g8, relatively safe for now.\n- White's king is on c8 \u2014 very advanced and dangerous.\n\n### Material:\n- Roughly equal material.\n- Black has a bishop vs. White's knight (slight edge to Black in open positions).\n- Both sides have rooks and minor pieces.\n\n### Tactical Opportunities:\n- The bishop on h2 can go to g3 or f4, possibly pinning or attacking something.\n- The knight on b8 is undeveloped and needs a good square.\n- The king on g8 should stay safe unless there's a clear benefit to moving it.\n\n### Strategic Goals:\n- Prevent White's king from advancing further.\n- Activate Black's pieces.\n- Possibly push pawns on the queenside to create counterplay.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\n### 1. `h2g3` \u2013 Bishop to g3\n- This develops the bishop actively.\n- It eyes the long diagonal and supports potential play on the kingside.\n- Also prepares to possibly double rooks on the d-file or support a central break with ...d5 or ...c5.\n- Not immediately threatened.\n\n### 2. `b8c6` \u2013 Knight to c6\n- Develops the knight to a natural square.\n- Supports central control and prepares for possible ...d5 or ...c5 breaks.\n- A solid developing move.\n\n### 3. `g8g7` \u2013 King to g7\n- Centralizes the king slightly.\n- Might help in supporting a future ...f5 break or defending against White's king infiltration.\n- Slightly passive.\n\n### 4. `h2f4` \u2013 Bishop to f4\n- Very aggressive.\n- Eyes the e3 square and could pin or pressure White's knight or queen if it comes to e3.\n- Could lead to tactical ideas.\n- However, the bishop may become overextended here.\n\n### 5. `f7f5` \u2013 Pawn break\n- Opens the position.\n- Could be useful if Black wants to activate the rook or knight.\n- But might also open lines for White's king to advance.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\n\nThe most **solid and flexible** move is:\n\n### `h2g3` \u2013 Bishop to g3\n\nIt develops a piece, keeps options open, and doesn't commit to any risky pawn breaks yet. It also helps coordinate Black's pieces and prepares for both defense and counterplay.\n\n---\n\n```\nh2g3\n```",

Black's opportunities:\n   - The bishop on g3 is very strong, controlling key squares\n   - The rook on b8 is inactive but could become active\n   - The pawn structure is solid\n\n5.

White has a knight and bishop for now, and a rook in the back rank. Black has a rook and knight, with a bishop on g3.\n- **King Safety**: White's king is in the corner at c8, but currently quite safe. Black's king is in the center on h7 \u2014 a potential target.\n- **Threats**: Black's bishop on g3 is eyeing the white king, but not an immediate threat. White has a knight on c3, which can become very active.\n- **White's Plan**: Use the knight on c3 to create threats, especially since Black's king is exposed. Also, White can try to centralize the knight or jump into strong squares like d5. White should aim to exploit the weak h7 and potentially push for a quick tactical win.\n- **White's Candidate Moves**:\n  - **c3d5**: Knight to d5, attacking f7 and e7, potentially forking king and rook.\n  - **c8d8**: Move king away from the corner, not ideal at this stage.\n  - **c8c7 / c8b7**: Exposing the king unnecessarily.\n  - Other moves like pawn moves or rook moves are passive.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe move **c3d5 (Nxd5)** is very strong here. It attacks the pawn on e7 (which is only defended by the king on h7 via f7), and also threatens tactical ideas like a knight fork if Black is not careful.\n\nLet\u2019s test the tactical idea:\n- If White plays **Nxd5**, Black must respond carefully.\n- If Black plays ...cxd5, then Bb4+ or Qa5+ could follow, depending on how the position unfolds.\n- Alternatively, if Black tries to move the king or defend passively, White can continue with strong central play.\n\nThus, **Nxd5** is the most aggressive and promising move in this position.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```",

Black has a knight and a bishop, but White has a massive material advantage.\n- **King Safety**: Black's king is exposed on h7, with limited defenders. White's king is in the corner but not an immediate target.\n- **White's Pieces**:\n  - Knight on d5 is very active.\n  - King on c8 is deep in enemy territory but currently safe.\n  - Rook on a1 can become active if the a-file opens.\n  - Bishop on c1 is undeveloped and currently useless.\n  - Pawns are mobile and can be pushed for control or promotion.\n- **Black's Pieces**:\n  - Knight on b8 is undeveloped.\n  - Rook on a8 is passive.\n  - Bishop on g4 is pinning the pawn on e2 but not dangerous.\n  - Pawns are mostly on the second and third ranks.\n\n### Plan:\nWhite is clearly winning. The goal should be to convert the material advantage into a win as efficiently as possible. The best approach is to:\n- Use the knight on d5 to create threats.\n- Possibly push central pawns to restrict Black.\n- Use the king's advanced position to assist in the center or queenside.\n- Avoid unnecessary exchanges that simplify into drawn endgames.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nLet's evaluate each legal move:\n\n#### King moves:\n- **c8c7** \u2013 King moves closer to the center. Useful for supporting pawns or pushing the advantage.\n- **c8b7** \u2013 King moves toward the queenside, possibly to support pawns or infiltrate.\n\n#### Knight moves:\n- **d5e7** \u2013 Knight captures on e7, but this gives up a strong piece for a pawn and opens the position, possibly helping Black.\n- **d5c7** \u2013 Knight captures on c7, winning a rook. This is a major blunder by Black if allowed.\n- **d5f6+** \u2013 Knight checks the king. May force Black's king to g6 or g7, opening up tactical possibilities.\n- **d5f4**, **d5b4**, **d5e3**, **d5c3**, **d5b6** \u2013 These all move the knight away from the center and key squares. Not ideal.\n\n#### Rook move:\n- **a1b1** \u2013 Rook move to b1 is passive unless preparing for a b4-b5 push. Not urgent.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- **d2d3**, **c2c3**, **b2b3**, **a2a3**, **d2d4**, **c2c4**, **b2b4**, **a2a4** \u2013 These are various pawn moves. Some prepare space, others support the knight or open files. But none are as strong as the tactical options.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe move **d5c7** wins a rook for a knight. This is a huge gain in material and essentially ends the game in White's favor immediately.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check:\n- Is the knight on d5 attacking c7? Yes.\n- Is c7 occupied by a rook? Yes.\n- Is the rook undefended? Yes.\n- Does capturing on c7 hang the knight? No.\n\nSo, **d5c7** is a free rook.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nd5c7\n```",

Black is to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **Black King is on h7**, quite exposed, but not immediately in danger.\n- **White King is on c8**, also somewhat exposed, but again not under immediate threat.\n- **Black has a rook on a8**, which is passive for now.\n- **Black has a knight on b8**, which is also not very active.\n- **White has a knight on c7**, attacking the rook on a8 (but it's defended by the black king).\n- **Black has a bishop on h4**, currently pinning nothing important, but could be repositioned.\n- **White has a pawn on e4**, and pawns on d2, c2, b2, a2 \u2014 all still on their original files.\n- **Black has pawns on a7, b7, d7, f7** \u2014 all still on their original files except possibly d7 and f7.\n- **White has a bishop on c1**, and a rook on a1 \u2014 both undeveloped or poorly placed.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n\n#### Rook on a8:\n- `b8c6` \u2013 Knight moves; not useful.\n- `b8a6` \u2013 Knight moves; not useful.\n\n#### King on h7:\n- `h7h8` \u2013 Moving king to h8, centralizing slightly.\n- `h7g8` \u2013 Moving king to g8, more active.\n- `h7g7` \u2013 Moving king to g7, very active.\n- `h7h6` \u2013 Moving king forward, possibly dangerous.\n- `h7g6` \u2013 Moving king forward, possibly dangerous.\n- `h7g6` \u2013 Also possible, but exposes king more.\n\n#### Bishop on h4:\n- `h4d8` \u2013 Bishop to d8, attacking the white king.\n- `h4e7` \u2013 Bishop to e7, attacking the white king.\n- `h4f6` \u2013 Bishop to f6, active square.\n- `h4g5` \u2013 Bishop to g5, active square.\n- `h4g3` \u2013 Bishop to g3, active square.\n- `h4f2` \u2013 Bishop to f2, active square.\n- `h4e1` \u2013 Bishop to e1, attacking the white rook on a1.\n\n#### Pawns:\n- `f7f6` \u2013 Supporting e5, opening up bishop.\n- `d7d6` \u2013 Supporting e5, opening up bishop.\n- `b7b6` \u2013 Preparing queenside play.\n- `a7a6` \u2013 Preparing queenside play.\n- `f7f5` \u2013 Pushing forward, aggressive.\n- `d7d5` \u2013 Central break, aggressive.\n- `b7b5` \u2013 Queenside expansion.\n- `a7a5` \u2013 Queenside expansion.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nBlack needs to improve piece activity and create threats. The most promising ideas are:\n\n- **Activate the bishop**: `h4e7` or `h4d8` puts pressure on the white king.\n- **Central break**: `d7d5` opens lines and creates counterplay.\n- **King activity**: `h7g7` brings the king into the center, supporting future play.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the best move:\n\n#### Move: `h4e7`\n- Places the bishop on a strong diagonal, targeting the white king.\n- Controls key squares around the white king.\n- Not easily attacked.\n- Forces White to respond defensively.\n\nThis move improves Black\u2019s position significantly and creates long-term pressure.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\nh4e7\n```",

The rook on a8 is under threat.\n\n#### Tactical Opportunities:\nThe most immediate idea is to capture on b7 with the king: **Kc8xb7**, attacking both the rook and knight simultaneously \u2014 this is a double attack (fork)!\n\nLet\u2019s look at that more closely:\n\n- **1. Kxb7** attacks the rook on a8 and the knight on b8.\n- Black cannot save both, so one of them will be lost.\n- This would be a massive win of material, likely leading to a quick win.\n\nOther candidate moves like **Nc7-e8** or **Nc7-a6** may also be good, but they don\u2019t carry the same immediate punch as taking on b7.\n\n#### Evaluation:\nWhite is already in a dominating position. Taking on b7 increases the advantage significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nc8b7\n```",

This captures the rook on a8 **with check**, creating immediate pressure and likely leading to a forced win.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n- After `b7c8`, the knight promotes with check to a8.\n- Black must respond to the check.\n- Black's king is at h7 \u2014 so `Kg8` or `Kh8` are possible.\n- Then White can follow up with `c8xf8` (capturing the bishop) or further checks depending on response.\n\nThis line is highly aggressive and capitalizes on the weak back rank and exposed black king.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is:\n\n```\nb7c8\n```",

Black has a bishop on f8, a knight on b8, and a king on h7. White has a knight on c7, a king on c8, and pawns on e4, a2, b2, c2, d2. There are also rooks and a bishop for both sides, but they are not fully developed yet.\n\nBlack to move.\n\n---\n\n## Key Observations:\n\n- **White's king is in the corner (c8)**, which is dangerous if Black can open lines or deliver checks.\n- **Black's king is on h7**, relatively safe for now.\n- **Black's bishop on f8** is currently blocked by its own pawn on g7 (which isn't visible in the FEN, so we assume it's still there).\n- **Black's knight on b8** is passive; it needs activation.\n- **White's knight on c7** is attacking the rook on a8 (if it were still there), but that rook is gone \u2014 likely captured already.\n- **Black has several legal moves**, mostly involving the bishop on f8, the knight on b8, and some pawn moves.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\n### Bishop on f8:\n- `f8g7`: Retreats the bishop to g7, connecting with the king and freeing up the diagonal.\n- `f8e7`: Centralizes the bishop, possibly eyeing the long diagonal.\n- `f8h6`: Attacks the white king along the diagonal if the g7 pawn is gone.\n- `f8d6`: Active square, eyes the center.\n- `f8c5`, `f8b4`, `f8a3`: These are more aggressive bishop moves, potentially threatening the white king if the path is clear.\n\n### Knight on b8:\n- `b8c6`, `b8a6`: Developing the knight, trying to get it into play.\n\n### King on h7:\n- `h7h8`, `h7g8`, `h7g7`, etc.: Moving the king to a safer square or centralizing.\n\n### Pawns:\n- `h7h6`, `h7g6`: Preventing back-rank issues or preparing king escape.\n- `f7f6`, `f7f5`: Opening lines or creating space.\n- `d7d6`, `d7d5`: Central pawn breaks.\n- `a7a6`, `a7a5`: Flank pawn moves.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation:\n\nThe most important thing is **safety of the king** and **activation of pieces**.\n\n- The white king is in the corner \u2014 this is a **major weakness**.\n- Black should aim to exploit this with checks and threats.\n- The bishop on f8 is currently passive \u2014 moving it to a more active square like `d6` or `c5` could be useful.\n- Alternatively, moving the king to g7 (`h7g7`) would centralize it and prepare for potential king-side activity.\n\nBut the best immediate idea is to **open the position** and **target the white king**.\n\n### Best Move: `f8d6`\n\nWhy?\n\n- It develops the bishop actively.\n- It puts pressure on the long diagonal toward the white king.\n- It prepares for possible king-side play.\n- It doesn\u2019t block any other pieces.\n- It keeps all options open while improving the worst-placed piece.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n```\nf8d6\n```",

King on c8.\n- **Black**: Rook (a8), Knight (b8), Bishop (d6), pawns on a7, d7, f7, e5.

Black has just moved, and it's your turn as Black.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **Material**: Roughly equal. White has a knight on e8 (which is deep in enemy territory), and Black has a rook on a8, bishop on d6, and pawns on a7, d7, f7, and e5.\n- **King Safety**: Both kings are relatively safe. White\u2019s king is on c8, which is unusual \u2014 possibly castled long or moved there for some tactical reason.\n- **Black's King** is on h7, not very safe, but not under immediate threat.\n- **White's Knight on e8** is attacking the rook on a8 via a discovered attack if the knight moves.\n- **Black's Bishop on d6** is active and can be repositioned.\n- **Black's Rook on a8** is passive and needs activation.\n- **Black's Pawns**: a7, d7, f7, e5 \u2014 some are backward or weak.\n- **White's Pawns**: a2, b2, c2, d2, e4 \u2014 solid structure.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n- `b8c6`, `b8a6` \u2013 Moving the rook from a8 to c6 or a6 to support central play or defend.\n- `h7h8`, `h7g8`, `h7h6`, `h7g6` \u2013 King moves; trying to improve king safety or centralize.\n- `d6f8`, `d6e7`, `d6c7`, `d6c5`, `d6b4`, `d6a3` \u2013 Various bishop moves; some aim to control key diagonals or squares.\n- `f7f6`, `a7a6`, `f7f5`, `a7a5` \u2013 Pawn moves; trying to create space or prevent threats.\n\n### Best Plan:\n\nWe want to improve our worst-placed piece: the rook on a8. The move `b8c6` (Rxa8) looks promising because:\n- It removes the rook from a passive square.\n- It supports the knight on e8 (which is currently attacking the rook).\n- It opens up possibilities for counterplay in the center or queenside.\n\nAlso, moving the rook to c6 puts pressure on the c-file and could help activate the rook more effectively.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n- Moving the king (`h7h8`, etc.) is too passive.\n- Moving the bishop (`d6c5`, etc.) may lose tempo or not achieve much.\n- Pawn moves like `f7f6` or `a7a6` are slow and don't address the main issue: rook activity.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nThe best move is to exchange the rook on a8 for the knight on e8, activating the rook and removing a dangerous enemy piece.\n\n```\nb8c6\n```",

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on b7\n- Black's king is relatively safe on h7\n- White has a knight on e8 that's very active and threatening\n- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\n3. Threats:\n- White's knight on e8 is attacking Black's rook on a8\n- White could play Kc7 next, bringing the king closer to Black's position\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Rook moves: Need to save the rook from the knight. a8e8 seems logical to trade knights.\n- King moves: h7g8 gets the king away from potential checks but doesn't address the immediate threat.\n- Bishop moves: d6f8 blocks potential checks but doesn't solve the rook issue.\n- Pawn moves: Don't address the immediate threat.\n\n5. Best move seems to be a8e8, trading the active white knight for the rook. After Nxe8 Rxe8, Black's position becomes more solid and the immediate threats are neutralized.\n\nOther options like moving the king or bishop don't solve the problem as effectively. The rook trade is the most forcing and simplifying move.\n\n```\na8e8\n```",

The key is to **maintain pressure** and avoid giving White counterplay.\n\nA strong idea is to **activate the rook** and possibly prepare for an attack on the kingside or central files.\n\nAmong all the rook moves, **`e8e7`** stands out as particularly strong because:\n- It puts the rook on the 7th rank, pressuring White\u2019s king.\n- It supports the e5 pawn.\n- It prepares for possible infiltration via the 7th rank.\n- It keeps flexibility and doesn't commit the rook to a passive square.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\ne8e7\n```",

It needs to be activated.\n- White has a lot of pawns on the queenside and center, but they are all on their original files (a2, b2, c2, d2) \u2014 this suggests a possible pawn break is needed to improve the position.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n1. **a6b7** \u2013 Capturing a pawn, but Black can respond with Rxb7, leading to simplification.\n2. **a6b5** \u2013 Restraining Black's queenside pawns and keeping tension.\n3. **a1b1** \u2013 Connecting the rooks or preparing to support a queenside pawn push.\n4. **d2d3** \u2013 A quiet developing move, supporting e4 or bishop development.\n5. **c2c3 / b2b3 / a2a3** \u2013 Typical prophylactic or preparatory moves.\n6. **d2d4** \u2013 Opening the center, creating space for the bishop.\n7. **c2c4 / b2b4 / a2a4** \u2013 Typical queenside expansion.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- White has a slight edge due to better pawn structure and more active king.\n- The position is closed, so **activating the bishop** is key.\n- Playing **d2-d4** opens the diagonal for the bishop and controls the center.\n- Alternatively, **c2-c4** or **b2-b4** could be used to create queenside play.\n\n### Best Plan:\nPlay **d2-d4**, opening the center and activating the bishop. This move increases White's control over the center and gives the bishop a useful diagonal (c1-a3 or b2). It also prepares for possible rook activity along the d-file.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nd2d4\n```",

This could become dangerous if not contained.\n- White has a central pawn on e4, which can be advanced.\n- White's light-squared bishop is on c1, with limited mobility for now.\n- Rook on a1 is semi-active; it could become more powerful along the 7th rank if given space.\n- White has pawns on b2, c2, a2 \u2014 all relatively undeveloped.\n- Black has pieces: Knight on c6 (attacking the king-side), Bishop on d5 (active), rook on e7, and another rook on d7 \u2014 both are pinning and pressuring pawns.\n- Black\u2019s a-pawn on a7 could potentially promote if left unchecked.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n1. **a6b7** \u2013 King captures on b7 (takes a pawn)\n2. **a6b5** \u2013 King moves closer to the center\n3. **c1h6** \u2013 Bishop to h6, attacking g7\n4. **c1g5** \u2013 Bishop to g5, eyeing f6/h7\n5. **e4e5** \u2013 Central pawn break, locking down Black\u2019s central play\n6. **a1b1** \u2013 Rook to b1, supporting b-pawn or preparing queenside activity\n7. **c2c3 / b2b3 / a2a3** \u2013 Pawn development, creating space\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe most **tactical and aggressive** idea is **e4e5**, pushing the central pawn. This creates immediate tension and restricts Black\u2019s pieces:\n\n- It blocks the diagonal of the Black bishop on d5.\n- It prevents ...d4-d3, which could be dangerous.\n- It opens lines for White\u2019s rook on a1 to exert pressure along the 7th rank via b1-bishop battery later.\n- It gains space and initiative.\n\nThis move also supports long-term control of the center and allows White to continue developing with ideas like Rb1, Bg5, or Kb5.\n\nOther options like moving the king or playing slow pawn moves are less effective here when White can seize the initiative with a strong central push.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\ne4e5\n```",

Black has a rook, bishop, and several pawns, while White has a rook, bishop, and a king that is quite advanced (on a6). Black\u2019s king is on h7, relatively safe for now. The key features:\n\n- **White's king is dangerously exposed** on a6.\n- **Black has a passed pawn on d4**, which could be a strong asset.\n- **Black has a bishop on d6**, which can target the weak light squares around White's king.\n- **Black has a rook on e7**, which can potentially double on the 7th rank or support an attack.\n- **White's rook is on a1**, far from the action.\n- **White's bishop is on c1**, also not very active.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `h7g8`, `h7g7`, `h7g6`, `h7h8`: These are mostly defensive or waiting moves. Not particularly useful unless preparing to centralize or connect with other pieces.\n\n#### Rook on e7:\n- `e7e8`: Could double rooks on the 8th rank if Black promotes something, but no immediate threat.\n- `e7e6`: Supports d5 or prepares for a possible push of f7-f6.\n- `e7e5`: Opens up possibilities for a discovered attack if the bishop moves.\n\n#### Bishop on d6:\n- `d6b8`, `d6c7`, `d6e5`, `d6c5`, `d6b4`, `d6a3`: Many options here. `d6e5` looks interesting as it attacks the e5 square and opens lines near White's king.\n- `d6e5` especially targets the light squares around White's king and may allow Black to coordinate an attack.\n\n#### Knight on c6:\n- `c6d8`, `c6b8`, `c6e5`, `c6a5`, `c6b4`: Again, `c6e5` is a good candidate, supporting the bishop and eyeing key squares.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- `f7f6`: Prepares to develop the bishop or rook, but not urgent.\n- `d4d3`: Pushes the passed pawn forward, threatening to promote. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Evaluation:\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move seems to be:\n\n### `d4d3`\n\nThis pushes the **passed pawn** one step closer to promotion. It creates an immediate threat and forces White to respond. With the pawn on d3, it will only take two more moves to promote (d3-d2-d1=Q), and Black can follow up with checks or mating threats depending on how White responds.\n\nAlso, note that White's king is on a6, and Black has a bishop on d6 and a rook on e7 \u2014 all of these pieces can contribute to a mating net if the d-pawn promotes.\n\nSo, pushing the pawn is both practical and aggressive.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```\nd4d3\n```",

But according to the FEN, that is the current legal position.\n\n### Positional Observations:\n- White\u2019s king is on **a6**, extremely far advanced and dangerously exposed.\n- Black\u2019s king is on **h7**, relatively safe for now.\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on **d3**, supported by a rook on e7.\n- Black also has a rook on e7 supporting the d3 pawn.\n- Black has a bishop on c6 and another on d6, both active.\n- White\u2019s only pieces are a bishop on c1, a rook on a1, and three backward pawns.\n- The critical point is that **White can capture on b7 with the king**, removing a key defender of Black\u2019s back rank.\n\n### Tactical Opportunity:\n- **a6xb7**: This captures a pawn and removes the a7-pawn\u2019s defender. If Black recaptures with the rook, it opens up a potential back-rank weakness.\n\nLet\u2019s explore:\n\n#### 1. `a6b7` (capture on b7)\n- Black\u2019s best reply is `Rxe5`, winning a pawn and opening the e-file.\n- However, after `Rxe5`, White gains time and activity, and Black still has many loose pieces.\n- Importantly, this move removes the a7-pawn\u2019s defender, which could be exploited later.\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and promising move.\n\nOther moves like moving the bishop (`c1g5`, `c1f4`) or pawns forward don't offer immediate threats or advantages. Moves like `e5-e6` might push a pawn but do not create immediate danger.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move here is **a6b7**, capturing the pawn and initiating a sequence that could lead to tactical complications or even a back-rank mate if Black is careless.\n\n```\na6b7\n```",

Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's king, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's king is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is on b7, very active and threatening\n- Black's king is on h7, somewhat exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Kxc6, winning the knight\n- White could push e6, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- Black needs to activate his pieces while restraining White's threats\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d3d2: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n- c6d4: Centralizing the knight, attacking e5 pawn\n- d6e5: Bishop takes pawn, but after Kxe5 White's king becomes more active\n- e7e5: Rook moves, but doesn't accomplish much\n- h7g7: King moves to safer square\n\nAfter considering these options, c6d4 seems most promising because:\n1) It centralizes the knight\n2) It attacks the e5 pawn\n3) It prevents White from playing e6\n4) It maintains flexibility for other pieces\n\nThe knight on d4 would be very strong, controlling key squares and limiting White's options. Other moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White counterplay.\n\n```\nc6d4\n```",

Black also has a passed pawn on a7.\n- There is a **tactical threat**: White\u2019s king is stuck in a vulnerable spot \u2014 it could be checkmated or trapped.\n- Black\u2019s pieces are active and surrounding the White king.\n- The critical line runs through the **e-file** and involves the rook on e7 and the bishop on d6 potentially delivering mate.\n- Immediate threats: Black may have a forced sequence leading to mate or winning back the king.\n\nLet\u2019s look at candidate moves for White:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves Analysis:\n\n#### 1. `b7c8` \u2013 King to c8\n- Exposes the king further into the fire.\n- Black can respond with `Re8+`, forcing the king back or into a worse trap.\n\n#### 2. `b7a8` \u2013 King to a8\n- Gets out of the immediate danger from Re7 and Bd6.\n- Still vulnerable to `Rc7+` or `Ba3` ideas.\n- Might allow Black to win the king via `Rc7+ Ka8 Ba3`.\n\n#### 3. `b7a7` \u2013 King to a7\n- Also dangerous; allows `Rc7+` followed by `Rc1+` skewer idea.\n\n#### 4. `b7a6` \u2013 King to a6\n- Too far from support, exposes king even more.\n\n#### 5. `c1h6` \u2013 Bishop to h6\n- Aims to trade off bishops, possibly simplifying into a draw.\n- But Black can ignore this and go after the king first.\n\n#### 6. `e5d6` \u2013 Pawn captures bishop\n- This is likely losing because it walks into a tactical sequence:\n   - `Rxe5+` follows, then `Kxd6 Re6+` etc., leading to loss of king.\n\n#### 7. `a1b1` \u2013 Rook to b1\n- Prepares to support the king or stop a counterplay.\n- Not bad, but passive.\n\n#### 8. `c2c3` \u2013 Central pawn move\n- Develops nothing, doesn't help king safety.\n\n#### 9. `e5e6` \u2013 Pushing the pawn\n- May open lines for Black\u2019s rook on the e-file.\n- Could accelerate the attack.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Evaluation:\n\nBlack is threatening a forced sequence that leads to either mate or trapping the White king.\n\nThe best way for White to survive is to **get the king out of danger quickly**.\n\nAmong all king moves, the **least dangerous** appears to be:\n\n### `b7a6`\n\nThis gets the king away from the immediate mating net along the 7th rank and opens a path toward b5 or b6, where it might find shelter behind the pawns.\n\nIt avoids the immediate `Rc7+` and gives White a chance to regroup.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\nb7a6\n```",

Kb7**, Black's rook on d7 is captured, and White gains material.\n- Black's best reply is likely **Rc7+**, skewering the king and rook.\n- Then **Kb6** (or Kb8), but in either case, Black can win back the rook or force a trade.\n\nThis line seems to give White a small advantage by removing a rook from the board and gaining a tempo with the king.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- The move **a6b7** is forcing and must be considered first.\n- It removes a rook from the board and may help White simplify into a more manageable endgame.\n- Other moves like **e5e6** or **b2b3** are less forcing and may allow Black to gain the initiative with the c2 pawn.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe best move here is **a6b7**, capturing the rook on b7 and forcing Black into a tactical response.\n\n```\na6b7\n```",

Let's see what happens after that.\n\nAfter `...c1=Q`, White can respond with `Kxc1`, and then Black loses the pawn and the initiative. So this is risky unless supported properly.\n\n#### 2. **...Rxe5** \u2013 Capturing the pawn on e5 with the rook.\n\nThis removes a key central pawn and opens up the e-file. It also activates the rook further. This looks promising.\n\n#### 3. **...Nf5** \u2013 Knight move attacking the rook on e7.\n\nThis could force the rook to move, potentially disrupting White's defense of the c2-pawn.\n\n#### 4. **...Bc5** \u2013 Bishop move to support the c2-pawn and prepare for promotion.\n\nThis is a quiet developing move that supports the c2-pawn and prepares to escort it to promotion.\n\n#### 5. **...Ke8** \u2013 King centralization.\n\nBringing the king into the center to support the c2-pawn and help promote it.\n\n---\n\n### Best Plan:\n\nThe most immediate and effective plan is to **capture on e5** with the rook (`...Rxe5`). This removes a key defender in the center, opens lines, and gives Black more control over the position. After this, Black can follow up with king centralization or push the c-pawn with support.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the line:\n\n1. `...Rxe5`\n2. `Rxe5` (White must recapture, otherwise Black promotes)\n3. `...Kg8` or `...Ke8` to centralize the king\n4. Then push `...c1=Q` with better support\n\nSo the best move here is:\n\n```\ne7e5\n```",

Strong candidate.\n9. **c1d2**: Also controls c1 square; same effect as Be3.\n10. **a1b1**: Could support b2-b3 or prepare Q-side activity.\n11. **b2b3**: Opens line for rook, supports bishop.\n12. **a2a3**: Slow.\n13. **b2b4**: Pushes pawn forward \u2014 weakens control over c3/d3.\n14. **a2a4**: Also slow.\n\n### Best Plan:\nWe must **stop Black\u2019s c2 pawn promotion** first.

Black\u2019s king is relatively safe, and Black has active pieces: a rook on e5, a knight on d4, and a bishop on d6.

But what matters more here is **activity**, **king safety**, and **tactical threats**.\n\n### Positional Observations:\n- White\u2019s king is in the corner, but relatively safe.\n- Black\u2019s king is on g7 \u2014 exposed to potential checks along the 7th rank.\n- Black\u2019s queen is on c1, eyeing the first rank, potentially threatening back-rank issues for White.\n- White\u2019s rook on a1 could be rerouted to support an attack or defend.\n- The bishop on e3 is active, eyeing h6 and possibly targeting g5 or f4.\n- There are open lines: the e-file is semi-open, and the c-file may become important due to both sides having queens/rooks there.\n- Black has a knight on d4, which is well-placed and attacking the e2 square.\n\n### Tactical Ideas:\n- **e3-h6** threatens check on h6 with potential follow-up ideas.\n- **e3-g5** puts pressure on f7 via the diagonal.\n- **e3-f4** supports the d4-square and eyes g5.\n- **e3-d4** captures the knight, but that might not be best since it relieves tension and gives Black counterplay.\n- **a1c1** removes the rook from the same file as the black queen.\n- **b2-b3** or **b2-b4** prepares space for the rook or bishop.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n- `e3h6` \u2013 Strong move; threatens immediate check on h6, opens up tactical possibilities.\n- `e3g5` \u2013 Also strong, pressures f7 and supports possible mating ideas.\n- `e3f4` \u2013 Solid developing move, supports central control.\n- `e3d4` \u2013 Removes a key defender, but gives Black some freedom.\n- `a1c1` \u2013 Defensive idea, avoids queen exchange.\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\nLet\u2019s focus on **e3g5**, putting pressure on f7. This can lead to:\n\n- Threatening Qxf7+ if the black king is vulnerable.\n- Supporting a future Rh1-h4 maneuver.\n- Potentially pinning a knight or creating a discovered attack.\n\nAlternatively, **e3-h6** is also very strong, threatening Qxh6+ followed by K moves and possible discovered attacks.\n\nBut let\u2019s go with **e3g5**, as it builds quiet pressure without immediately committing to a forcing line.\n\n---\n\n```\ne3g5\n```",

There is a **discovered attack** possibility if the bishop on d6 moves, revealing the queen\u2019s line of attack.\n\nAlso, note that **e5-e8+** (rook moving to e8) would be check and could win material or force the white king into a worse position.\n\nBut even better: **d6-f8** (bishop takes on f8) would be a **discovered check** from the queen on c1, because the bishop is currently blocking the queen\u2019s diagonal to the white king.\n\nLet\u2019s look at that move more closely:\n\n- **d6f8**: Bishop captures on f8, **discovered check** from the queen on c1.\n- After this, the white king must move.\n- Then Black can follow up with **Qxc2**, winning a pawn and possibly more.\n\nThis seems like a **very strong tactical sequence**.\n\n### Let's test it:\n\n1. ... Bxf8+  \n   - King must move: Kb7 \u2192 Ka6 or Kb8\n2. ... Qxc2 (or Qc8+ etc.)\n\nBlack wins material and keeps up the pressure.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move here is:\n\n```\nd6f8\n```",

Bh6 Re6??**, then **2. Bg7+ Kg8 3. Bf6**, and Black is in zugzwang.\n\nBut even better: If we play **1. Bh6**, and Black tries to block with **Re6**, then after **2. Bxf7! Rxf7 3. Kc8**, and now the rook must stay on f7 or lose it, but that leads to **Rh1#** ideas.\n\nAlso, note that **Qc1xa1** is not possible because of **Rook takes queen with check**, so Black cannot easily exploit the open file.\n\nLet\u2019s test **Bg5-h6** as the most forcing and decisive move.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe move **g5h6** is the strongest here \u2014 it threatens an immediate mate on h7, forces Black into very tight defenses, and gives White the best chance to convert the position.\n\n```\ng5h6\n```",

It avoids any counterplay and starts a forced sequence where Black cannot recover.\n\nAfter **b7b8(q)**:\n- New queen on b8 is protected by the rook on a1.\n- Threatens immediate mate on a7 or k-side invasion.\n- Black must deal with multiple threats while trying to promote c2, which becomes nearly impossible.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Move:\n\n```\nb7b8\n```",

However, Black's pieces are not perfectly coordinated, and White may have tactical chances due to the exposed Black king on g7.\n\n### Positional Observations:\n- The Black king is on g7, somewhat exposed but defended by the e5 rook and f8 bishop.\n- White\u2019s light-squared bishop on g7 is attacking the Black king directly, but it can be captured or deflected.\n- White\u2019s king is on b8, quite far from the action, but potentially safe.\n- Black\u2019s queen on c2 is active and threatening, but currently undefended by major pieces.\n- White\u2019s rook on a1 could become more active if lines open up.\n- There is potential for a back-rank weakness in Black\u2019s position due to the passive rook on f8 and limited escape squares for the king.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### 1. `g7h6` \u2013 Bishop takes on h6\nThis removes the immediate threat to the Black king and gains a tempo by attacking the king. It also opens up possibilities for further pressure along the diagonal.\n\nAfter `g7xh6+`, Black must move the king:\n- `kg7-h8` or `kg7-g8` are the most likely options.\n\nThen White can follow up with `Rh1` or prepare a discovered attack using the rook on the open file.\n\n#### 2. `b8b7` \u2013 King moves to b7\nThis centralizes the king slightly, but does little to improve White\u2019s attacking chances.\n\n#### 3. `a1h1` \u2013 Rook to h1\nThis prepares to double pressure on the h-file after `g7h6+`. But playing this *before* the bishop move gives away the initiative.\n\n#### 4. `g7f6` \u2013 Bishop to f6\nThis threatens the rook on e5 and keeps pressure on the diagonal, but doesn\u2019t force the king to move immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Best Plan:\nThe best approach is to start with **`g7h6+`**, forcing the Black king to move and disrupting coordination. This is a forcing move that creates tactical tension and may allow White to regain some material or create threats.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ng7h6\n```",

Black has a bishop and rook vs. White\u2019s bishop and rook, but Black also has a knight.\n- **King Safety**: Both kings are relatively exposed. Black\u2019s king is on h7, which is not ideal, but it's not immediately under threat.\n- **White's Threats**: The white queen on c2 is very active and threatens multiple squares. It could potentially deliver check or capture material.\n- **Black's Active Pieces**: The rook on e5 is well placed, eyeing the open e-file and potentially threatening the white king if lines open up. The knight on d4 is also centrally placed.\n- **Black's Bishop on f8**: It's currently passive, but can become active with proper development.\n- **White's Bishop on h6**: This is a strong piece, pinning the black pawn on g7 (if moved) and potentially eyeing the long diagonal.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### 1. **...Rxe1**\n- Removes the rook from e5 to e1, possibly to double rooks on the e-file or support a counterattack.\n- But this seems passive and gives White more control of the center.\n\n#### 2. **...Nd4-f5**\n- Knight moves to f5, attacking the bishop on h6 and gaining tempo.\n- This is an aggressive move that puts pressure on White's setup.\n\n#### 3. **...Bf8-d6**\n- Develops the bishop actively, eyes the long diagonal, and supports possible play with ...f5 or ...e5.\n- Also defends against any ideas of Bxg7+.\n\n#### 4. **...Qxc2**\n- Captures the white queen!\n- Is this safe? Let's check:\n   - After `...Qxc2`, White plays `Rxc2`, so material remains balanced.\n   - But Black gains time and removes a dangerous attacker (the queen).\n   - This is a **very tempting move**.\n\n#### 5. **...Rxe4**\n- Captures on e4, removing a central pawn and opening the e-file for the rook.\n- Could lead to tactical complications.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe most forcing and best move here is **...Qxc2**, capturing the white queen. It removes a key attacker for White and simplifies the position in Black's favor.\n\nAfter `...Qxc2 Rxc2`, the position becomes more balanced, but Black retains a slight edge due to better piece activity and central control.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\nc2c2\n```",
