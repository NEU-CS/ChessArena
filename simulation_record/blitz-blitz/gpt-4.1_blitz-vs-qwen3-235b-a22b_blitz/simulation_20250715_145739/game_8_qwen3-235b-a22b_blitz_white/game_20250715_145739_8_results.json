As Black, I have several main responses to consider:\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. ...c5 (Sicilian Defense)\n2. ...e5 (Open Game, symmetrical)\n3. ...e6 (French Defense)\n4. ...c6 (Caro-Kann Defense)\n5. ...d6 (Pirc Defense)\n6. ...g6 (Robatsch/Modern Defense)\n7. ...d5 (Scandinavian Defense)\n8. ...Nf6 (Alekhine's Defense)\n\n**Analysis:**\n- ...c5 (Sicilian Defense): This is the most combative response, aiming for an unbalanced position and fighting for the center from the flank. It leads to rich, complex positions and offers Black good winning chances.\n- ...e5: Symmetrical, classical, and solid. Leads to open games, but White can steer into many well-analyzed lines.\n- ...e6: French Defense, solid but can be passive if not handled well.\n- ...c6: Caro-Kann, solid and less theoretical than the French.\n- ...d5: Scandinavian, directly challenging the center but can lead to early queen development.\n- ...Nf6: Alekhine's Defense, provocative, inviting White to advance.\n\nGiven the need to play for a win and press for advantage, the Sicilian Defense is statistically the most successful response for Black at all levels, offering dynamic counterplay and many opportunities for both sides to go wrong.\n\n**Final decision:**  \nI will play the Sicilian Defense.\n\n```\nc7c5\n```",
