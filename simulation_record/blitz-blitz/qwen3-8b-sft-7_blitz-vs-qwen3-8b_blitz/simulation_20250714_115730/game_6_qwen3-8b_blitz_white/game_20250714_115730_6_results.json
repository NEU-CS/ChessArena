Other moves (developing bishop, queenside pawn moves) are less common and may allow White to seize the initiative.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- g8f6: Develops a knight, attacks e4, and is the most flexible.\n- e7e5: Petrov, but allows White to play Nf3 and d4 with a strong center.\n- d7d5: Scotch, but White can play Nc3 and d4 with a strong center.\n- c7c5: Sicilian, but White can play d4 with a strong center.\n\nOf these, g8f6 is the most principled move, developing a piece and contesting the center.

Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible.

The knight on f6 is attacked and must move or be defended.\n- The most common and best move here is to capture the pawn with the knight: Nf6e5.\n- Other options include moving the knight to g8, h5, d5, g4, or e4, but these are less principled and allow White to gain space or initiative.\n- Defending the knight (e.g., d7-d6) is possible, but after exf6, Black loses a tempo and White can develop with tempo.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f6e5 (Nxe5): The main line, accepting the Scotch Game. After Nxe5, White usually plays d4, and Black can continue with d6 or d5.\n2. f6d5 (Nd5): Retreats the knight, but allows exf6, gaining White a pawn.\n3. f6g8 (Ng8): Retreats the knight, but loses time.\n4. c6e5 (Nxe5): Same as above, but less direct.\n5. Other moves: Not as good as Nxe5.\n\nConclusion: The best move is to capture the pawn with the knight.\n\n```\nf6e5\n```",
