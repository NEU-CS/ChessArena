Nc3: Develops a piece, supports e4, but blocks the c-pawn.\n3. Bb5: Pins the knight on c6, could be annoying for Black.\n4. Bc4: Develops the bishop to an active square, eyes f7.\n5. g3: Prepares Bg2, but less direct.\n6. Be2: Prepares to castle, but less ambitious.\n\nLet's evaluate:\n\n- d4: If Black exchanges (cxd4), White can recapture with the knight (Nxd4), gaining a strong center and piece activity. If Black doesn't exchange, White has a strong pawn center.\n- Nc3: Solid, but less ambitious than d4.\n- Bb5: Pins, but Black can play ...a6 and ...b5, gaining space.\n- Bc4: Good development, but d4 is more direct.\n\nBetween d4 and Nc3, d4 is more principled, taking the center and opening lines.\n\nTactical considerations:\n- After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, White has a lead in development and central control.\n- No immediate tactics for Black after d4.\n\nTherefore, the best move is 3.d4.\n</think>\n<answer>\n```\nd2d4\n```\n</answer>",

Black's knight is on c6, bishop on c8, queen on d8, king on e8, bishop on f8, knight on g8.\n5.

This also develops the knight to a central square.\n   - **e7-e6**: Pawn move, opening lines for the bishop and queen, and supporting the d5 square.\n   - **g8-f6**: Knight move, developing the knight and contesting the center.\n   - **f7-f6**: Pawn move, but this weakens the king's position and is not ideal.\n   - **b7-b6**: Pawn move, but this is passive and doesn't contest the center.\n\n5. **Best Move**:\n   - **Nc6-d4** is a strong move. It attacks the pawn on d4, develops the knight to a central square, and puts pressure on White's position. If White captures the knight with the pawn (d4xd5), Black can recapture with the queen or bishop, gaining a central pawn.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The best move is **Nc6-d4**.\n\n<answer>\n```\nc6d4\n```\n</answer>",

Qd3 (develop queen, support knight, eye h7)\n7. h3 (prevent Ng4)\n\nLet's evaluate the most forcing move first: 1. Bb5+.\n\n1. Bb5+ forces Black to respond. Black can block with Bd7 or Nd7.\n- If ...Bd7, White can exchange on d7 or retreat.\n- If ...Nd7, White can consider d6, gaining space and tempo.\n\nAlternatively, 4. g4 attacks the knight on f5, but after ...Nd6, Black's knight is well-placed and White's kingside is weakened.\n\n3. Bc4 develops, but doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\n2. Bd3 is solid, but not forcing.\n\nSo, Bb5+ is the most forcing and likely best move. Let's check the lines:\n\n6. Bb5+ Bd7 (forced)\n7. Bxd7+ Qxd7 (or Nxd7)\nNow, White can play Ne5, attacking the knight on f5 and threatening to exchange off Black's active piece, or d6, gaining space.\n\nAlternatively, after 6. Bb5+ Nd7, White can play d6, and Black's bishop is locked in.\n\nTherefore, 6. Bb5+ is the best move, developing with tempo and forcing Black to react.\n</think>\n<answer>\n```\nBb5+\n```\n</answer>",

When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nYour reasoning process and answer must be enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n\n<answer>\n```\n<move>\n```\n</answer>\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n\n<answer>\n```\ne2e4\n```\n</answer>\n\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n\nYou will get evaluated following Evaluation Scoring Rules:\n# Format Score:\n- ```<move>``` is the most important tag, if you output your move inside ```, score 0.5\n- If you output special tokens like <think>, each token will add 0.125 points\n- So, if you follow the format exactly as above, format score is 1\n- Otherwise, score 0\n\n# Correctness Score:\n- If your final move is legal but not good enough, score 3\n- An additional move quality score, where the score is higher when your move is better, with a maximum score of 6 and a minimum score of 0.\n- So, if you get a best move, correctness score is 9\n- Otherwise, score 0\n\nYou will get the final score as their sum. Only when you have got the format score can you potentially obtain the correct score. \nYou should try your best to analysis the chess board and get the optimal move.\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"
