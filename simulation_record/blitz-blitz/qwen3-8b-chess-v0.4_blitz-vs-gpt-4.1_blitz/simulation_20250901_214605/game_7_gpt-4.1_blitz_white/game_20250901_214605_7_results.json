Key observations:\n- White has advanced a pawn to e4\n- Black has all pieces still on their starting squares\n- The position is very early in the game (move 1 for Black)\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Developing pieces is generally good in the opening\n- Possible moves: d7d5 (challenging White's e4 pawn), f7f5 (also challenging e4), or moving a knight (g8f6 or b8c6)\n- Other moves would either be repetitive (like e7e6) or not useful (like h7h6)\n\n5.

Since all pieces are on their starting squares, the only possible moves are pawn moves (a7a6, b7b6, c7c6, e7e6, f7f6, g7g6, h7h6) and piece moves (but no pieces can move yet).\n\nBut let's check the legal moves:\n- Black's pawns can move: a7a6, b7b6, c7c6, e7e6, f7f6, g7g6, h7h6.\n- Black's pieces cannot move (all on starting squares).\n\nWhite's pawn on c6 is blocking Black's c7 pawn.\n\nBest move:\n- Black should try to develop pieces and control the center.

Nc3, Black may play d5, attacking the c6 pawn.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **d2d4** is the best move, as it supports the c6 pawn, opens lines for development, and keeps the pressure on Black.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nd2d4\n```",

It also keeps the pressure on Black's queenside, where White's pawn is advanced.\n- **Nf3** is also good, but Nc3 is more relevant to the queenside tension.\n- **Bf4** is tempting, but developing knights before bishops is usually better, and Nc3 supports the c6 pawn indirectly.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nDeveloping the knight to c3 is the best move, supporting the center and preparing for further development.\n\n**UCI notation:**\n```\nb1c3\n```",

After d5, Black's bishop must move (likely exd5, but then White can recapture with the knight or queen). However, after d5, Black's bishop on d7 is attacked and must move. But wait, the bishop on d7 is not on c6, so d5 attacks the bishop on d7, but the pawn on c6 is blocking the c8 bishop. After d5, Black can play exd5, and White can play cxd7+ (pawn takes bishop with check), forcing Black to recapture with the queen or king, losing castling rights.\n\n- **Nf3**: Standard development, but not as forcing as d5.\n\n- **Bd3**: Also standard, but not as forcing as d5.\n\n- **cxd7+**: Captures the bishop, but after Qxd7, White loses the strong c6 pawn and Black's queen becomes active.\n\n**Best move:**\n\n- **d5** is the most aggressive and challenging move. It attacks the bishop on d7, threatens to open the center while Black's king is still in the center, and supports the c6 pawn. If Black plays exd5, White can play cxd7+ with check, forcing Black to recapture with the queen or king, losing castling rights.\n\n**Let's check the line:**\n1. d5 exd5\n2. cxd7+ Qxd7 (if Kxd7, Black loses castling rights)\n3. Qxd5 (if White wants to exchange queens, but White can also continue development)\n\nAlternatively, after d5, if Black plays ...Bc8, White can continue with Nf3 or Bd3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is:\n```\nd4d5\n```",

Material and Position Assessment\n\n- **Material:** Both sides are equal in material.\n- **King Safety:** Both kings are uncastled, but White's king is safer for now.\n- **Center:** White has strong pawns on d6 and c6, cramping Black's position.\n- **Development:** White is ahead in development; Black's queenside is undeveloped.\n- **Threats:** Black threatens ...Bxc6, ...Qxd6, and possibly ...b4 to attack the knight.\n\n### 2. Candidate Moves\n\nLet's list White's candidate moves:\n\n- **dxe7:** Captures the bishop, but Black can recapture with Qxe7.\n- **cxd7+:** Checks the king, but Black can block with Qxd7 or Bxd7.\n- **Nxb5:** Captures the b5 pawn, attacking the rook on a8.\n- **Be2:** Develops a piece, preparing to castle.\n- **Nf3:** Develops a piece, preparing to castle.\n- **Qf3:** Attacks the rook on a8 and threatens Qxa8.\n- **a4:** Attacks the b5 pawn.\n\n### 3. Deep Calculation of Key Moves\n\n#### **A. cxd7+**\n\n- 8. cxd7+ Qxd7 (forced, as Bxd7 allows dxe7)\n- Now, White can play dxe7, attacking the queen and threatening to promote.\n- After dxe7 Qxe7, White has a passed pawn on d7, but Black can blockade.\n\n#### **B. dxe7**\n\n- 8. dxe7 Qxe7\n- White can play Nxb5, attacking the rook and threatening Nc7+.\n- After Nxb5 Bxb5, White has lost the strong pawn on d6.\n\n#### **C. Nxb5**\n\n- 8. Nxb5 Bxc6 (Black regains the pawn)\n- White can play dxe7 Qxe7, but loses the strong pawn on d6.\n\n#### **D. Qf3**\n\n- 8. Qf3 Qxd6 (Black captures d6 pawn)\n- White can play Qxa8, but Black gets material compensation.\n\n#### **E. Be2 or Nf3**\n\n- Developing moves, but do not press the advantage.\n\n### 4. Best Move Selection\n\nThe most forcing move is **cxd7+**, which forces Black to respond and opens lines. Let's analyze further:\n\n#### 8. cxd7+ Qxd7\n- 9. dxe7 Qxe7\n- Now, White has a passed pawn on e7, but Black can blockade.\n- White can play Nf3, Be2, or Qd5, but Black is solid.\n\nAlternatively, after 8. cxd7+ Bxd7:\n- 9. dxe7 Nxe7\n- White has a passed pawn on e7, but Black can blockade.\n\nHowever, after 8. cxd7+ Qxd7, White can play Qf3, attacking a8 and threatening Qxa8.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nAfter 8. cxd7+ Qxd7 9. Qf3, White threatens Qxa8, and Black cannot easily defend the rook.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\n**The best move is:**\n```\ncxd7\n```\nThis move forces Black to respond, opens lines, and keeps the initiative.",

When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\n\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"
