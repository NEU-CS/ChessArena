This move severely violates opening principles: it neglects development, forfeits castling rights, and exposes the king. As Black, I have a decisive advantage and my goal is to convert it efficiently.\n\nThe strategy should be straightforward:\n1.  **Rapid and principled development:** Bring my pieces into the game as quickly as possible. Knights and bishops should be developed to control the center.\n2.  **Control the center:** My pawn structure (`c5`, `d6`, `e6`) is already solid. I should reinforce this control with my pieces.\n3.  **Attack the exposed king:** The white king on e2 is a massive, permanent target. Once my pieces are developed, I will launch a coordinated attack.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n*   **g8f6:** This is the most natural and best move. It develops the kingside knight to its optimal square, controls the key central squares e4 and d5, and prepares for future development (like ...Be7 and ...0-0, although castling might not be urgent given the open nature of the center and the white king's vulnerability). This move is a perfect example of punishing an opponent's poor play with sound, classical development.\n\n*   **b8c6:** This is another excellent developing move. It develops the queenside knight, controls d4 and e5, and puts pressure on the center. It's a very strong alternative to `g8f6`. The choice between them is a matter of style, but `g8f6` is slightly more flexible as it also prepares for kingside development and safety.\n\n*   **d6d5:** A direct challenge in the center. While this is a good move in principle, it's generally better to develop a piece first. After a move like `g8f6`, the `d5` push will be even stronger as it will be supported by the knight.\n\n*   **c5c4:** This move cramps White's position and prevents `d2-d4`, but it releases the central tension and does not develop a piece. Development is the top priority.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to capitalize on White's egregious opening is through rapid, purposeful development. The move `g8f6` is the best embodiment of this strategy. It improves my position significantly without taking any risks and poses immediate problems for White, who must now find a way to untangle their pieces around their misplaced king. It is the most logical and powerful move on the board.\n\n```\ng8f6\n```",

The White king is on f3, a ridiculously exposed square, while White's pieces remain undeveloped. Black, on the other hand, has a solid pawn structure and has started development. This gives Black a decisive advantage.\n\nMy goal is to exploit the misplaced White king as quickly and efficiently as possible. The most principled way to punish an opponent who neglects the center and exposes their king is to strike in the center. Opening lines will make the White king's position untenable.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1.  **`d6d5`**: This is the most powerful and principled move.\n    *   **Central Break:** It challenges White's control of the center and attacks the weak e6 pawn.\n    *   **Opens Lines:** It opens the c8-h3 diagonal for the light-squared bishop, which will put immediate pressure on the f3 king. It also opens the d-file for the queen and rook.\n    *   **Initiative:** It forces White to react to a central threat, preventing them from consolidating their awkward position. For example, after `d5`, if White plays `Ke3`, Black can play `dxe6`, and after `fxe6`, `Bxe6` develops a piece and shatters White's remaining pawn structure. If White tries `d3`, `dxe6` followed by `Qxd1+` leads to a winning endgame for Black.\n\n2.  **`f6g4`**: This is a very tempting tactical move, directly targeting the king.\n    *   It forces White to respond to the threat on h2. White would likely play `Ke3`, moving the king away. While Black is still winning after a move like `d5`, it allows the king to escape some of the immediate pressure. The move `d5` is more fundamental.\n\n3.  **`b8c6`**: A standard developing move.\n    *   It's a good move in any normal position, but here it's too slow. It doesn't create the immediate problems that `d5` does. We have a golden opportunity to punish White's play, and we should seize it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe move `d6d5` is superior to all other options. It is a classic reaction to a flank attack (or in this case, a king walkabout): strike back in the center. It improves Black's entire position, opens critical lines of attack against the White king, and seizes the initiative in a decisive manner. It is the most direct path to converting this massive advantage into a win.\n\n```\nd6d5\n```",

The king is now on **f3**, quite exposed in the center but perhaps temporarily placed for development or coordination.\n\nBlack has played a Sicilian-like setup with ...c5, followed by ...d6 and ...e6, and then ...d5, breaking open the center early. Black\u2019s knight is already developed to f6 and White\u2019s knight is still on b1.\n\nWhite has not yet developed either knight or bishop. This is a significant lag in development.\n\nThe center is open (with pawns exchanged on e5/d5), so rapid development and control of central squares will be key.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate some of the more promising legal moves:\n\n### 1. **b1c3** \u2013 Developing the knight, supporting d5, flexible.\n- Good developing move.\n- Prepares for full development and potential central play.\n\n### 2. **g1e2** \u2013 Develops the bishop\u2019s knight, keeps options open.\n- Supports f4 or d4 later.\n- Keeps king-side pieces active.\n\n### 3. **f3g3** \u2013 Moving king toward the wing, possibly preparing for a rook lift or to free up space.\n- Risky to move the king again without development.\n- May expose the king further if not properly supported.\n\n### 4. **f1c4** \u2013 Active bishop development, eyes the weak f7 square.\n- Immediate pressure on the kingside.\n- Could lead to tactical opportunities.\n\n### 5. **d2d4** \u2013 Central expansion, supports e5, opens lines.\n- Strong central idea, but may overextend if not well-supported.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation:\n\nWhite needs to prioritize **development** and **central control**. There is no immediate tactical threat from Black, but Black is ahead in development.\n\nBest approach: Combine **development** with **central influence**.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on **b1c3** first \u2014 this brings a piece into play, supports the center, and doesn\u2019t risk anything.\n\nAfter **Nc3**, White can follow up with **Ne2**, **Bc4**, and **d4**, gaining momentum quickly.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision:\n\n```\nb1c3\n```",

There are no immediate counter-tactics from Black that threaten White\u2019s king or disrupt this plan.\n\nOther moves like `f3g4`, `f3f4`, or `d1e2` are slower and allow Black to regroup or even equalize.\n\nThus, the best move here is:\n\n# \u2705 Win material and maintain initiative\n\n```\nc3e4\n```",

This is not a time for slow, strategic maneuvering; it's a time for a decisive, tactical assault.\n\nMy primary goal is to open lines and bring my pieces to attack the exposed king. The white knight on e4 is the only developed piece for White and a key defender. Removing it or forcing it away is a top priority.\n\nLet's evaluate the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1.  **`d5e4`**: This move immediately challenges and removes White's best piece, the knight on e4. After White recaptures with `d4xe4`, the d-file is opened, and more importantly, the e4-knight, which controlled key squares like g3 and f2, is gone. This paves the way for a devastating pawn storm. The sequence `1... d5e4 2. d4xe4 g7g5!` is crushing. White's king is caught in a mating net.\n    *   If `3. Kg3`, then `h5` follows, and the attack is overwhelming.\n    *   If `3. Ke2`, then `g4` traps the king.\n    *   If `3. Kf2`, then `g4` again traps the king.\n    This move is direct, forceful, and appears to lead to a winning position by force.\n\n2.  **`g7g5`**: This is another excellent attacking move. It directly threatens to play `g4+`, harassing the king. However, it allows White to respond with `Ng3`. While Black is still much better after `Ng3`, the knight on g3 provides some much-needed defense for the white king, and it complicates the win slightly compared to the `d5e4` line.\n\n3.  **`e6e5`**: This move also attacks the knight on e4. If `Nxf6+ exf6`, the king is still a target. If `Ng3`, we transpose to a similar situation as the `g7g5` line where the knight gets to a better defensive square. It's a very strong move, but perhaps not as precise as `d5e4`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the top candidates, `d5e4` is the most precise and ruthless move. It eliminates the key defender immediately, leaving the white king completely exposed to a follow-up attack with `g7g5`. This sequence gives White no time to consolidate and leads to a swift and decisive advantage for Black. I must press this advantage relentlessly.\n\n```\nd5e4\n```",

White has already moved their king to f3, which is dangerous early in the game, but it suggests that some forcing sequence has occurred due to prior captures.\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the game up to this point:\n\n### **Move History (UCI):**\n- e5e6 (pawn takes on e6)\n- f7e6 (pawn recaptures)\n- e1e2 (King moves to e2)\n- g8f6 (Black develops knight)\n- e2f3 (King now on f3)\n- d6d5 (Black pushes pawn)\n- b1c3 (White develops knight)\n- f6e4 (Black knight captures)\n- c3e4 (White recaptures with knight)\n- d5e4 (Black pawn recaptures)\n\nNow it's White's turn again.\n\n### **Current Legal Moves:**\n- `f3g4` \u2013 King moves to g4\n- `f3f4` \u2013 King moves forward to f4\n- `f3e4` \u2013 King captures on e4\n- `f3g3` \u2013 King moves to g3\n- `f3e3` \u2013 King moves to e3\n- `f3e2` \u2013 King retreats to e2\n\nWe must be extremely cautious here \u2014 the White king is exposed and in the center of the board. The key is to avoid any tactical threats while improving our position or exploiting Black's weaknesses.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Evaluation:\n\n- **Material:** Equal.\n- **Pawn Structure:** Slightly better for White after the exchange e5-e6 and d5xe6; however, Black has central pawns on e4 and c5.\n- **Development:** Black has developed one knight and queen. White has moved the king early and has two pieces out (knight and bishop), but the king is dangerously placed.\n- **Threats:** Black has a potential pin along the e-file with the queen on d8 and the White king on f3. Also, the e4-pawn is under attack by the White king.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Candidate Move Analysis:\n\n### 1. **f3e4** \u2013 King captures on e4:\n- This removes the advanced e4-pawn threat.\n- However, it exposes the king further and opens the e-file for Black's rook/queen to put pressure.\n- After ...Qg5+, White will have to move the king again or block with f3, which weakens the structure.\n\n\u26d4 Not ideal \u2014 too risky.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **f3f4** \u2013 King advances to f4:\n- Keeps the king centralized but avoids the e-file.\n- Blocks the diagonal of the Black light-squared bishop.\n- Still quite unsafe, but less so than moving to e4.\n\n\u26d4 Risky and doesn't solve long-term king safety.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **f3g4** \u2013 King moves to g4:\n- Very dangerous \u2014 king on the edge but still exposed.\n- Could lead to quick mate ideas from Black with Qh5+ or Bg7.\n\n\u26d4 Extremely dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **f3g3** \u2013 King moves to g3:\n- Gets off the open file.\n- Prepares to castle queenside or connect with the h2 rook if possible.\n- Safer than previous options.\n\n\u2705 A strong candidate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **f3e3** \u2013 King moves to e3:\n- Centralizing the king slightly more.\n- Might help support pawn breaks like d3 or c3.\n- Still vulnerable to back-rank threats later.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Neutral \u2014 not bad, but not clearly better.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **f3e2** \u2013 King retreats to e2:\n- Returns to a safer square.\n- Connects the king with the rook on a1 via Kd1.\n- Allows for future castling rights (if possible).\n- Gives flexibility to develop other pieces without king exposure.\n\n\u2705 Strong option.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Decision:\n\nBetween **f3e2** and **f3g3**, both are reasonable, but **f3e2** offers better long-term flexibility and reduces immediate danger to the king.\n\nRetreating the king to e2 also allows for potential castling if we can reposition the king back toward d1.\n\nThus, the best move is:\n\n```\nf3e2\n```",

White's king is on e2, which is a major, almost decisive, weakness. It is exposed, prevents the rooks from connecting, and severely restricts White's development. Black, on the other hand, has a solid pawn structure and all pieces ready to join the attack. The black pawns on c5, e4, and e6 exert significant control over the center. The pawn on e4 is particularly strong, as it cramps White's position and controls key squares (d3, f3). My primary strategic goal is to exploit the exposed white king and prevent White from consolidating.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **e6e5**: This is an exceptionally strong move.\n    *   **Central Dominance:** It creates a formidable pawn duo on e4 and e5. This duo completely paralyzes White's central pawns (the d-pawn and f-pawn cannot move) and controls the critical squares d4, f4, d3, and f3.\n    *   **King Hunt:** It further entombs the white king on e2. White's most natural developing moves are illegal.\n    *   **Development:** It opens the c8-h3 diagonal for my queen's bishop.\n    *   **Initiative:** It poses immediate and severe problems for White, forcing them into a passive, defensive posture. After 1... e5, White's best try is likely 2. Ke1 to begin the arduous task of getting the king to safety, but Black can continue to build pressure with natural developing moves like 2... Nc6.\n\n2.  **d8d5**: This is another powerful attacking move.\n    *   The queen immediately enters the game, putting pressure on White's position and restricting the king.\n    *   It prevents White from playing d2-d3.\n    *   However, bringing the queen out this early can sometimes allow the opponent to gain tempi by attacking it. In this specific position, White's development is so hampered that this is less of a concern, but it's a factor to consider. The line 1... Qd5 2. c3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. cxd4 exd3+ 5. Kxd3 looks crushing for Black.\n\n3.  **b8c6**: A standard and good developing move.\n    *   It develops a piece, controls the center (d4, e5), and prepares to join the attack.\n    *   It is a solid move, but less forceful than `e6e5`. The move `e6e5` creates a static, structural advantage that is more profound and lasting.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWhile `d8d5` is a very tempting tactical blow, `e6e5` is strategically overwhelming. It establishes a crushing positional advantage based on central pawn dominance that completely suffocates White. The resulting position is one where Black's plan is simple and clear (develop pieces and attack the king), while White has no good moves and can only hope to survive. In a critical match, securing such a dominant and stable advantage is the most reliable path to victory. The move `e6e5` relentlessly presses the advantage and leaves White with almost no hope for counterplay. It is the absolute best move.\n\n```\ne6e5\n```",

White has already moved their king to e2 (from e1 to f3 to e2), which suggests some early king activation or defensive maneuvering.

            "content": "This is a critical moment in the game. My opponent's king is dangerously exposed on e2, a consequence of a highly unorthodox opening. My pawn on e4 is a powerful attacking piece, currently threatening the white knight on f3. My main goal is to exploit the vulnerability of the white king and convert my significant advantage into a swift victory.\n\nLet's analyze the candidate moves:\n\n1.  **e4f3**: This is a check (`exf3+`). Forcing moves like checks must be considered with the highest priority, especially when the opponent's king is exposed.\n    *   This move immediately forces the white king to move, preventing White from consolidating their position.\n    *   Possible replies for White are `Ke1`, `Kf1`, `Kd2`, or `Kd3`.\n    *   In all cases, the white king remains in a perilous situation.\n    *   Crucially, this move creates a black pawn on f3. This pawn is a monster. It controls the g2 square, preventing the white king from finding shelter there, and it's a passed pawn that will be a constant threat.\n    *   After White moves the king, say to `Ke1`, I can follow up with `...e4`, re-establishing a powerful pawn duo, cramping White's position severely, and preparing to swing my queen into the attack via h4 or g5.\n    *   This move is the most direct and powerful way to press my advantage.\n\n2.  **e4e3**: This is another aggressive pawn push. It attacks the f2 pawn and prepares to create a passed pawn.\n    *   If White plays `2. Ke1`, I can play `...exf2+`, and after `3. Kxf2`, I can continue the attack with `...Qf6+`. This is very strong.\n    *   However, `e4e3` is not a check, giving White a tempo to react. For instance, White could try to create complications elsewhere or simply move the king to a slightly safer square without being forced.\n    *   Compared to `e4f3+`, this move feels slightly less forceful.\n\n3.  **c8g4**: This is a solid developing move. It pins the knight on f3 to the queen on d1.\n    *   This puts pressure on White, but it's a slower approach. White can respond with `h3`, forcing my bishop to move or trade, or with `Ke1`, unpinning and preparing to deal with the threats.\n    *   Given the tactical urgency of the position, a developing move, while good in principle, is likely not the best choice here. I should prioritize the direct attack on the king.\n\n4.  **b8c6**: A standard developing move, controlling the center.\n    *   Similar to `c8g4`, this is a good, solid move, but it lacks the immediate, crushing force of the pawn moves. It allows White time to try and untangle their pieces.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe move `e4f3` is overwhelmingly the best. It is a forcing check that capitalizes on the opponent's most significant weakness. It creates a powerful passed pawn on f3 and forces the white king into an even more exposed position, from which it is unlikely to escape. This move relentlessly presses the advantage and sets the stage for a decisive attack. I must play this move.\n\n```\ne4f3\n```",

White has already castled king-side (King on e2), and several early moves have been made, including a number of central pawn advances and piece exchanges.\n\n### Current Position Summary:\n\nWhite\u2019s King is in the center (on e2), which is unusual but not necessarily dangerous yet. The kingside is intact (pawns still on original squares), so a later transfer to the kingside could be possible.\n\nBlack has advanced pawns on the center and queenside: ...e5, ...c5, and ...e4. Black also has a doubled pawn on the f-file due to ...exf3.\n\nWhite has lost the right to castle long (king moved to e2), and only four legal moves are available:\n\n- `e2f3`: King moving forward toward f3\n- `e2e3`: King stepping back toward e3\n- `e2e1`: Retreating the king toward the corner\n- `g2f3`: Knight move (developing or retreating)\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `e2f3`\n- Brings the king closer to safety on the kingside.\n- Also opens up space for a potential rook lift via Re1 or Rd1.\n- Keeps the king active and centralized.\n- Not immediately vulnerable to attack since Black doesn't have developed pieces targeting that area.\n\nThis looks like the most natural and useful move.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `e2e3`\n- Central square, but slightly passive.\n- Doesn\u2019t improve king safety significantly.\n- Blocks some diagonal for the light-squared bishop.\n- Less dynamic than `e2f3`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `e2e1`\n- Retreats the king to a more passive square.\n- Might prepare for castling queenside (but not possible anymore).\n- Seems overly cautious and gives away space.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `g2f3`\n- Develops the knight, possibly preparing to reposition it.\n- However, with the king exposed in the center, moving a piece may not be best when king safety is at stake.\n- Could be useful if followed by d3, Bxf3, etc., but not urgent.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`e2f3`** \u2014 it improves the king's position, keeps options open, and avoids passivity.\n\n```\ne2f3\n```",

My entire focus must be on exploiting this weakness immediately and forcefully. Delaying the attack could give White a chance to consolidate, which is unacceptable.\n\nI have analyzed several candidate moves:\n\n1.  **`b8c6`**: This is a standard and strong developing move. It improves my position, controls the center, and prepares to bring the knight into the attack. It maintains a winning advantage. However, it is not the most direct or forceful continuation.\n\n2.  **`e5e4+`**: This is a tempting check that further displaces the white king. While strong, it sacrifices my valuable e5-pawn, which currently restricts the white king and controls the key d4 square.\n\n3.  **`c8g4`**: This move is a check (`Bg4+`) and immediately brings a new piece into the attack with tempo. It forces the white king onto an even more precarious square and initiates a sequence that appears to be a forced checkmate.\n\nLet's verify the mating sequence after `c8g4+`:\n*   `10... Bg4+`\n*   `11. Ke3` (This is White's most likely reply. If `11. Kg3`, then `11... h5!` is crushing, threatening `h4+` or `h4#`.)\n*   `11... Qd4+` (A powerful queen check, forcing the king forward.)\n*   `12. Kf4` (Forced.)\n*   `12... g5+` (A brilliant pawn sacrifice to open the g-file and hunt the king.)\n*   `13. Kxg5` (Forced. If `13. Kf5`, `Qf6#`. If `13. Kg3`, `h5` wins.)\n*   `13... Rg8+` (The rook joins the attack with a check.)\n*   `14. Kh4` (Forced.)\n*   `14... Qf6+` (The queen continues the chase.)\n*   `15. Kh5` (Forced.)\n*   `15... Qg6+`\n*   `16. Kh4` (Forced.)\n*   `16... Qg5#`\n\nThis sequence leads to a forced checkmate. When a forced mate is available, it is always the correct move. It is the most ruthless and efficient way to win the game, leaving no room for error or counterplay. Therefore, `c8g4` is the only move to consider.\n\n```\nc8g4\n```",

Black has just played **...Bg4**, pinning the White knight on e2 (if it were still there), but in this case, the knight has already moved (from g1 to f3). So the bishop is simply attacking the king's position.\n\nWhite\u2019s pieces are somewhat scattered:\n- King exposed on f3\n- Rooks not yet connected\n- Bishop on c1 undeveloped\n- Queen on d1\n\nBlack has a strong central presence with pawns on **d5** and **e5**, though some of that was exchanged here.\n\nThe legal moves for White right now are:\n- `f3g4` (King takes Bg4)\n- `f3e4` (King retreats toward center)\n- `f3g3` (King tries to castle short manually)\n- `f3e3` (King steps back one square)\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation of Legal Moves:\n\n### 1. `f3g4` (Kxg4)\n- This captures the Black bishop.\n- But leaves the White king wide open in the center.\n- Black can respond with **Qh5+**, forcing the king around or even into danger.\n- Not advisable \u2014 too risky.\n\n### 2. `f3e4` (Ke4)\n- Centralizes the king slightly.\n- Keeps king away from immediate checks.\n- Still very dangerous \u2014 king is in the open.\n- Could be forced to march further forward or backward under pressure.\n\n### 3. `f3g3` (Kg3)\n- Tries to mimic kingside castling manually.\n- Exposes king to potential rook lift or queen checks like **Rh8-h5** or **Qh5+**\n- Also dangerous due to lack of cover.\n\n### 4. `f3e3` (Ke3)\n- Simple retreat one square back.\n- Keeps king off the g-file where Black might later play Rh8-h5.\n- Slightly safer than other king moves.\n- Might allow White to regroup and connect rooks eventually.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Analysis:\n\nAll king moves are bad \u2014 the king should never be this exposed this early. However, among them, **`f3e3`** is the least dangerous. It avoids immediate tactical threats and gives White a chance to reorganize.\n\nIt also opens a line for the queen on the d-file if needed and keeps the king slightly more centralized without walking into immediate checks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n```\nf3e3\n```",

            "content": "The position is overwhelmingly in Black's favor due to the catastrophically exposed White king on e3. My primary objective is to launch a decisive and immediate attack to checkmate the king. White's pieces are undeveloped and cannot come to the king's aid in time. I must be precise and forceful to convert this advantage.\n\nLet's analyze the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1.  **`b8c6`**: This is a standard and powerful developing move. It controls the center, puts pressure on d4, and prepares to bring the knight into the attack. After `1... Nc6`, White might try to complicate with `2. Kxe5`. While Black is still winning after `2... Qd4+ 3. Kf4 g5+`, it allows White's king to start a run, which could introduce unnecessary complexities.\n\n2.  **`e7e6`**: Another excellent move. It prepares to develop the f8-bishop and, more importantly, prepares `...Qd5+`. Similar to `b8c6`, it allows the `2. Kxe5` response, leading to a chase where precision is required.\n\n3.  **`d8d4`**: This move is the most direct and forcing. It immediately puts the White king in check, severely restricting White's options. Let's follow the sequence:\n    *   `1... Qd4+`. White's only legal move is `2. Ke2`.\n    *   `2... Qxe4+`. Another check. White is again forced to respond with `3. Be2`.\n    *   `3... Nc6`. Now, after this series of forced moves, Black has not only won a pawn but has also developed the knight with tempo. The White king is trapped on the e-file, and White's position is on the verge of collapse. White has no good answer to the threats of `...Nd4+` and `...Bxe2+`. For instance:\n        *   `4. d3 Qxe2+ 5. Kd1 Nd4` followed by `...Qc2#` or other decisive threats.\n        *   `4. a3 Nd4+ 5. Kd1 Bxe2+ 6. Nxe2 Qxe2#`.\n        *   `4. Ke1 Nd4 5. d3 Qxe2#`.\n\nThe line starting with `1... Qd4+` is a concrete, forcing sequence that leads to either checkmate or a completely winning material advantage. It is the most clinical way to punish White's exposed king, leaving no room for counterplay. Therefore, it is the absolute best move.\n\n```\nd8d4\n```",
