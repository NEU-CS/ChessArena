If Black ignores this, White will win the rook on a8.\n\n**Best move:**\n- ...a6 attacks the knight, forcing it to retreat or exchange. If White plays Nd6+, Black can respond with Bxd6, and the knight is exchanged for a bishop, but Black loses castling rights and gets a damaged pawn structure.\n- ...d6 does not prevent Nc7+.\n- ...Qa5+ is not effective; White can block with Nc3 or Bd2.\n\n**Let's check ...a6:**\n- If 5...a6 6.Nd6+ Bxd6 7.Qxd6 Qe7, Black can exchange queens and avoid losing the rook.\n- If 5...a6 6.Nd6+ Bxd6 7.Qxd6 Qe7 8.Qxe7+ Nxe7, Black loses castling rights but keeps material balance.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n- ...Nf6 develops, but after Nc7+ Qxc7, White wins the rook.\n- ...Bb4+ is not effective.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to play ...a6, immediately challenging the knight and preventing the fork on c7.\n\n**Final move in UCI notation:**\n```\na7a6\n```",

If White exchanges, Black can recapture with the queen or pawn, and the knight is no longer a problem.\n- **Qf6**: Develops the queen, but doesn't challenge the knight directly.\n- **g8f6**: Develops the knight, but White's knight on d6 remains strong.\n\n**d7d6** is the most direct and logical move, challenging the knight and opening lines for development.\n\n**Final answer:**\n```\nd7d6\n```",
