Bf3, then Re8) and Black can try to challenge the center.\n- **f6d5**: 13...f6d5 14. Bxd5 Bxd5 15. Qxd5 and White has a strong queen in the center.\n- **f6g4**: 13...f6g4 14. Qxg4 Bf6 and Black can try to play for f5, but White is better.\n\n**Best move:**\nThe most principled move is **e7d6**, directly challenging White's center and opening lines for the bishop on b7.

If White recaptures with the bishop, Black can play Qh4, threatening mate on h2. But White can defend with h3 or Re1.\n\n2. **g4e5** (Knight takes e5): This also exchanges off the bishop, but the knight is less valuable than the bishop. After Bxe5+ Rxe5, White can play f4, gaining space.\n\n3. **d8f6** (Queen to f6): Defends the knight and adds pressure to d4, but White can play f4, attacking the knight again.\n\n4. **e8e5** (Rook to e5): Attacks the bishop on d4, but White can play f4, attacking the rook and knight.\n\n5. **g4f6** (Retreats the knight): Passive, but keeps material.\n\n6. **f7f6** (Pawn to f6): Defends the knight, but weakens the king's position.\n\n**Deep calculation:**\n\n- **d6e5** is the most forcing. Let's look at the line:\n    - 17...Bxe5 18.Bxe5+ Nxe5 (if White recaptures with the bishop, Black can recapture with the knight, defending g4 and centralizing the knight)\n    - Now, Black is not losing material, and the knight is on a good square.\n    - If 19.f4 (attacking the knight), then 19...Ng6, and the knight is safe.\n    - Black has exchanged off White's strong bishop and is not worse.\n\n- **g4e5**:\n    - 17...Nxe5 18.Bxe5+ Rxe5 19.f4 Re8 20.Rae1, White has a strong center and open lines.\n\n- **d8f6**:\n    - 17...Qf6 18.f4, White gains space and attacks the knight.\n\n- **e8e5**:\n    - 17...Re5 18.f4, White attacks the rook and knight.\n\n- **g4f6**:\n    - 17...Nf6, passive, and White can play Rae1, increasing pressure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is **d6e5** (Bishop takes e5), exchanging off White's strong bishop, removing the threat to the knight, and keeping the position balanced.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd6e5\n```",

No immediate threat to the king, so unnecessary to move it.\n2. **e8e5:** Rook takes bishop. But after dxe5, White wins a piece.\n3. **d8f6:** Queen to f6, attacks the bishop and defends f7.

This is a direct capture.\n6. **f7f6:** Pawn move, blocks the bishop, but weakens the king.\n\n**Critical calculation:**\n- If g4e5 (Nxe5), Black captures the strong bishop. White can recapture with pawn (dxe5), but then Black can play Rxe5, regaining the piece. Let's see:\n\n18... Nxe5 19. dxe5 Rxe5\n\nNow, Black has exchanged pieces and removed White's strong bishop. Material is equal, and Black's position is improved.\n\n**Is there any tactic for White after Nxe5?**\n- After Nxe5, White can play f4, attacking the rook, but Black can retreat.\n- No immediate threats.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the bishop with the knight.\n\n```\ng4e5\n```",

If Black can eliminate it, White's compensation for the missing queen disappears.\n- **d8c7** directly attacks the c6 pawn, and if White plays cxb7, then Qxb7 and Black is up a queen for a rook and pawn with no compensation for White.\n- **e5c6** is tempting, but after b2-b3, the knight is trapped (b3-b4 next), so that's not good.\n- **d8c7** is the most direct and effective move.\n\n**Tactics:**\n- After **d8c7**, if White tries cxb7, then Qxb7 and Black is completely winning.\n- If White tries to defend c6 with b3, then Qxc6 and Black is up a queen for a rook and pawn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is:\n```\nd8c7\n```",

Rook moves: a8 (blockade), e8 (defense), c7 (defense/attack)\n2. Knight moves: e5 (central, can go to g4, f3, d3, c4, c6, g6)\n3. Pawn moves: h7-h6/h5, f7-f6/f5, d7-d6/d5, a6-a5\n\n**Critical analysis:**\n- If Black plays a passive move, White may coordinate rooks and push b7.\n- If Black plays actively, perhaps with ...Nf3+ or ...Ng4, it could create threats.\n- ...Nf3+ is not possible now, but ...Nxc4 is possible, attacking the a3 pawn and removing a defender from the b7 pawn.\n- ...Nxc4 bxa8=Q Rxa8 Rxa8 Rxa8, and Black is down material.\n- ...Nxc4 bxa8=Q Rxa8 Rxa8 Rxa8, White is up a rook.\n- ...Nxc4 bxa8=Q Rxa8 Rxa8 Rxa8, White is up a rook.\n\n**Defensive moves:**\n- ...Rab8 to reinforce the b7 pawn blockade.\n- ...Rab8 is not possible, but ...a8b8 is legal.\n\n**Best move:**\n- ...Rab8 (a8b8) is the most solid, keeping the rook on the b-file to prevent b7-b8=Q. This also allows the other rook to remain flexible.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na8b8\n```",

If Black does not capture it, White will play b7-b8=Q next move. The only way to stop this is to capture the pawn.\n\nLet's check ...Rxb7 (b8b7):\n\n1. ...Rxb7 2. Rxb7 Rxe1+ 3. Kg2 Rxe1 4. Rxc7 (or Rxd7) and White is up a rook.\n\nAlternatively, what about ...Qxb7 (c7b7)? 1. ...Qxb7 2. Rxe8 Rxe8 3. Rxe8 and White is up a rook.\n\nWhat about ...Re6 (e8e6)? 1. ...Re6 2. Rxe6 fxe6 3. b7 and White will queen.\n\nWhat about ...Qf4 (c7f4)? 1. ...Qf4 2. Rxe8 Rxe8 3. b7 and White will queen.\n\nWhat about ...d6 (d7d6)? 1. ...d6 2. b7 and White will queen.\n\nWhat about ...Rxe1+ (e8e1)? 1. ...Rxe1+ 2. Rxe1 Rxb7 3. b3 and White is up a pawn, but Black has some activity.\n\nBut after ...Rxb7, White can play Rxb7, and after Rxe1+ Rxe1, Black is down a rook.\n\nIs there any way to create counterplay? What about ...Qf4, threatening Qxf3? After ...Qf4, White can play Re3, defending f3 and b3.\n\nAlternatively, ...Qe5, threatening Qxh2+? After ...Qe5, White can play Rxe8.\n\nIt seems that Black is in a losing position, but the only way to avoid immediate disaster is to capture the b7 pawn.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n```\nb8b7\n```",

If White ignores, Black threatens Rxb2 and Rc2, attacking f2 and b2.\n- **c7c4**: White can play b3, defending, or Rc8, but then c4c3 is possible.\n- **c7e5**: Attacks h2, but White can defend easily.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **b7b2** is the most aggressive, invading the 2nd rank and threatening to coordinate with the other rook. White cannot easily defend all pawns, and Black's rooks become very active.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb7b2\n```",

This could win material.\n\nLet's check this line:\n1. ... b2b1\n2. Rxb1 Qc4\n\nNow, the rook on b1 is pinned, and Black threatens Qxc4 and Qf3. White's rook on e7 is not threatening anything immediate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb2b1\n```",

The d-pawn is a passed pawn and can be pushed. White's only pawn is on h2 and is not dangerous yet.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **d7d6**: Advance the passed pawn, but White can try to attack the rook with Kg5.\n2. **a6a5**: Not urgent, doesn't change much.\n3. **f7f6+**: Check, but White can play Kg4 or Ke4.\n4. **h6h2**: Rook to h2, attacking the pawn, but White can play h4.\n5. **h6h5+**: Check, but White can go to g4 or f4.\n6. **g7h8/g7g8/g7f8**: King moves, but not urgent.\n7. **d7d5**: Pushes the pawn, but White can try to blockade.\n\n**Best plan:**  \nPushing the passed pawn is the most logical. The White king is cut off from the d-file, so pushing d6 is safe and prepares d5-d4. The rook on h6 controls the sixth rank, so White's king cannot invade easily.\n\n**Check for tactics:**  \n- f7-f6+ is a check, but after exf6, the king is still cut off.\n- h6h5+ is a check, but doesn't achieve much.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to push the passed pawn and prepare to support it with the rook and king.\n\n```\nd7d6\n```",

White cannot defend it, so Black will win the pawn next move and then easily convert.\n- **h7h6**: Threatens mate, but White can play h3, giving up the pawn.\n- **f7f6**: Restricts the king, but not as forcing as taking the pawn.\n- **g7f6**: King move, but not as direct.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **g6g2** is the most direct. It attacks the h2 pawn, and after capturing it, Black will have a rook and multiple pawns against a lone king. No stalemate risk, and the win is straightforward.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng6g2\n```",

Black is up a pawn and has a dominating rook.

The h2 pawn is weak. Black can win by picking up the h2 pawn and then converting the extra pawns.\n- Rook to h2 attacks the pawn and threatens to win it. White cannot defend it.\n\n**Check for tactics:**  \n- g2h2: If White plays Kg3, then h2 falls.\n- If White tries to activate the king, the pawn is lost.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to play g2h2, attacking and winning the h2 pawn, after which Black's win is straightforward.\n\n```\ng2h2\n```",

If Black plays Bf8, then Qxg4 regains the piece with a strong attack.\n2. **Qxg4**: Simply captures the knight, but after Rxe3, Black gets some activity.\n3. **Bf4**: Defends the queen and develops, but doesn't address the threat directly.\n4. **Bd2**: Retreats the bishop, but is passive.\n5. **h3**: Kicks the knight, but after Nxe3, fxe3, Qg5, Black gets some counterplay.\n\nLet's analyze **Qxg7+** in detail:\n- 1. Qxg7+ Kxg7 2. Bd4+ (check) f6 (only move) 3. h3 Nh6 4. Rfe1 and White is dominating.\n- If 1...Bf8, then 2.

The only threat is if White's king gets to f6 and starts attacking pawns, but Black's rook is very active and can cut off the king.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **h2h6+**: Check, forces the king to move. If Kg5-f5, then Rh6 is still cutting off the king.\n2. **h2g2**: Lateral rook move, but doesn't threaten anything.\n3. **h2h5+**: Check, but the king can go to f4 or g4.\n4. **h2h4**: No check, but cuts off the king.\n5. **f7f6+**: Pawn move, but doesn't do much.\n6. **d6d5**: Pawn move, but not urgent.\n\nThe most forcing move is **h2h6+**. This keeps the king cut off and allows Black to bring the king up or push pawns.\n\nLet's check the lines:\n- 1... Rh6+ 2. Kg5-f5 (or Kg4) Rh5+ 3. Kf4 (or Kg4) and Black can keep checking or start pushing pawns.\n\nAlternatively, after 1... Rh6+ 2. Kg5-f5, Black can play Rh5+ and then bring the king up or push pawns.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh2h6\n```",

The most precise move is to bring the rook to g1, cutting off the king from the f-file and preparing to advance the king and pawns.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh1g1\n```",

If Black plays Bf8, then Qxg4 regains the piece with a strong attack.\n2. **Qxg4**: Simply captures the knight, but after Rxe3, Black gets some activity.\n3. **Bf4**: Defends the queen and develops, but doesn't address the threat directly.\n4. **Bd2**: Retreats the bishop, but is passive.\n5. **h3**: Kicks the knight, but after Nxe3, fxe3, Qg5, Black gets some counterplay.\n\nLet's analyze **Qxg7+** in detail:\n- 1. Qxg7+ Kxg7 2. Bd4+ (check) f6 (only move) 3. h3 Nh6 4. Rfe1 and White is dominating.\n- If 1...Bf8, then 2.

The d2 pawn is one square from promotion, and White's king is far from stopping it. White has no immediate threats.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Promote d2 pawn (d2d1Q, d2d1R, d2d1B, d2d1N)\n2. Rook moves (g5g8, g5g7, etc.)\n3. King moves (f6e7, f6e6, etc.)\n4. Pawn move (a6a5)\n\nPromoting the pawn to a queen (d2d1q) is the most powerful and direct way to press the advantage. White has no way to stop the new queen, and Black will have overwhelming material.\n\nBefore promoting, let's check for any stalemate or perpetual check possibilities:\n- After d2d1q, White's king on h7 has moves (h7h8, h7h6), so no stalemate.\n- White has no checks or threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.\n\n```\nd2d1q\n```",

This is a trivially won position for Black, but caution is needed to avoid stalemate.\n\n**Immediate threats:** \n- White's king is trapped in the corner (h8), so stalemate is a risk if Black is careless.\n- Black can use the rook to cut off the king and bring the king closer, or start pushing pawns.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. Rook moves along the 5th rank (g5g8, g5g7, etc.) to cut off the king.\n2. King moves (f6e7, f6g6, etc.) to approach the pawns or support pawn advancement.\n3. Pawn move (a6a5) to start pushing the a-pawn.\n\n**Stalemate check:** \n- If the rook moves to g8, White's king is not stalemated because Black still has pawns and king moves.\n- If the rook moves to g7, same logic.\n- If the king moves, White still has h8 to stay on.\n\n**Best plan:** \n- The most methodical way is to cut off the king with the rook (g5g8), then bring the king up and push the pawns. \n- Alternatively, start pushing the a-pawn, but there's no rush.\n\n**Risks:** \n- Avoid stalemating the king by removing all escape squares with the rook and pawns.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n- The best move is to cut off the king with the rook, maximizing control and minimizing stalemate risk.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng5g8\n```",

But with the king so far, it's not a concern yet.\n- f7f6 or f7f5 start pushing the f-pawn.\n- King moves (f8e8, f8e7) don't achieve much.\n\nThe best plan is to push the a-pawn to promotion, since the White king is too far to stop it.

White has only the king, Black has a queen, pawn, and king. The White king is on g2, Black's queen is on h4, and Black's king is on g8.\n\n**Immediate threats and tactics:**\n- The White king is on the second rank, so back rank mates are not possible.\n- The Black queen can deliver checks and restrict the White king's movement.\n- The Black pawn on f7 can advance, but the priority is to avoid stalemate and push for checkmate.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- h4g4+ (check): White king can only go to h2 or f2.\n- h4h3+: White king can go to f2 or h1.\n- h4g5: No check, but restricts the White king.\n- h4e4: No check, but centralizes the queen.\n- f7f5/f7f6: Advance the pawn, but not urgent.\n\n**Best move analysis:**\n- h4g4+ is forcing. Let's see the consequences:\n    - 1... Qg4+ 2. Kf2 (if Kh2, then Qh4+ and repeat)\n    - After 2. Kf2, Black can play Qf4+ and drive the king further to the edge.\n- h4h3+ is similar, but after Kh1, Black needs to be careful not to stalemate.\n\n**Avoiding stalemate:**\n- If the White king is on h1 and Black plays Qh3+, it's stalemate if the pawn is still on f7 and Black's king is far.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The best move is to check with the queen and drive the White king to the edge, avoiding stalemate. Qg4+ is the most forcing and safe.\n\nMy move:\n```\nh4g4\n```",

This is a trivially won position for Black, but we must avoid stalemate and checkmate as quickly as possible.\n\n**Immediate threats:** \n- White's king is on g2, with no pawns or pieces to help.\n- Black's queen is on h4, controlling the fourth rank and the h-file.\n- Black's king is on g8, safe.\n- Black's pawn is on f7, ready to advance.\n\n**Stalemate check:** \n- If we play a careless queen move that covers all escape squares for the White king, we could stalemate. Let's check the king's current squares:\n    - g2: occupied by White king\n    - h2: not available (off board)\n    - f2: available\n    - h3: not available (off board)\n    - f3: available\n    - g3: available\n    - h1: not available (off board)\n    - g1: available\n    - f1: available\n\nSo, White's king has plenty of moves. No stalemate risk right now.\n\n**Best plan:** \n- Bring the queen closer to cut off the king, or advance the pawn to f5/f6 to help with mate.\n- The fastest way to mate is to force the king to the edge and deliver mate with queen and king.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. h4g4+ (check): White king must move. Let's see where:\n    - g2-g1, g2-f2, g2-f3, g2-h3, g2-h1 (but h1/h3/h2 are off board)\n    - Only g1, f2, f3 are possible.\n    - After g4+, White king moves, then Black can bring the king closer or advance the pawn.\n\n2. h4g5: Queen centralizes, cuts off more squares.\n\n3. f7f5: Advance the pawn, but not urgent.\n\n4. h4h5: Keep queen on h-file, not as active.\n\n5. h4h1: Queen to h1, but doesn't help.\n\n**Best move:** \n- h4g4+ is forcing and drives the king further away, making progress toward mate.\n\n**Double-check for stalemate:** After h4g4+, White has legal moves, so no stalemate.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nh4g4\n```",

After f6, White can play Kg3, but Black can continue f5, and the king can support the pawn.\n2. f7-f5: Same idea, but pushes further. After f5, White can play Kg3, but Black can play Kg7, and the pawn can advance.\n3. King moves: g8-h8, g8-f8, g8-h7, g8-g7. These are waiting moves, but advancing the pawn is more direct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- f7-f6, Kg3, Kf7, Kf4, Ke6, Ke4, f5+, Kf4, Kf6, and Black will queen.\n- f7-f5, Kg3, Kg7, Kf4, Kf6, Ke3, Ke5, f4+, Kf3, f4, and Black will queen.\n\n**Stalemate check:** None of these moves stalemate White.\n\n**Best move:** Advancing the pawn is the most direct and winning plan.
