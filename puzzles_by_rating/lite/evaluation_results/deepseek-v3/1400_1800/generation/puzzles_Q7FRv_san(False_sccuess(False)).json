When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, knight, bishop, queen vs White's rook, bishop, queen). \n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8 with White's bishop on g4 eyeing the king. White's king is safer on g1.\n3. Key observations:\n   - White has a strong bishop pair (Bd3 and Bg4) controlling important diagonals.\n   - White's queen on g3 is very active, eyeing both the kingside and the c7 pawn.\n   - Black's queen on f6 is somewhat exposed and could become a target.\n4. Threats to consider:\n   - White could play Bh5 next move, forcing the queen to move and potentially winning the h6 pawn.\n   - White might consider doubling rooks on the e-file.\n5. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - f6g6: Gets the queen out of the bishop's line of fire and defends h6 pawn\n   - g8h8: Moves the king to a safer corner\n   - e6f5: Counterattacks with the bishop\n   - d5d4: Gains space in the center\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f6g6 seems most prudent as it protects the h6 pawn and gets the queen to a safer square while maintaining flexibility. Other moves either leave the queen exposed or don't address immediate threats.\n- g8h8 is also reasonable for king safety, but f6g6 deals with more pressing concerns.\n- e6f5 looks tempting but after Bxf5 Qxf5, White gains the bishop pair advantage and opens lines toward Black's king.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf6g6\n```"
