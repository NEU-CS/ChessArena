When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's rook is attacking White's h3 pawn\n2. White's rook is on the b-file with potential to move vertically\n3. Black's king is relatively active on g6\n4. White's king is somewhat exposed on h4\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b4b8 - rook to 8th rank (potentially threatening back rank)\n2. b4b7 - rook to 7th rank (attacking g7 pawn)\n3. f3f4 - pawn advance (but this seems passive)\n4. a4a5 - pawn advance (not immediately helpful)\n5. e4e5 - pawn advance (could open lines)\nBest move analysis:\n- b4b7 is very strong because:\n  - It attacks the g7 pawn which is only defended by Black's king\n  - If Black takes the h3 pawn with Rxh3, White can play Rxg7+ winning the pawn\n  - Black would then be in a difficult position with his king exposed\n  - Even if Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure on g7\nOther moves:\n- b4b8 is less effective as it doesn't create immediate threats\n- Pawn moves don't address the immediate rook threat to h3\n- Moving the rook away from the b-file would lose control\nAfter b4b7:\n- If Rxh3, then Rxg7+ Kxg7 is bad for Black as White's king can pick up the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, White can maintain pressure and potentially advance pawns\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb4b7\n```"
