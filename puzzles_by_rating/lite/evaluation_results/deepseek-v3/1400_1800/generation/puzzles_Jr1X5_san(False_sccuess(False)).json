When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 2 pawns, King\n   - Black has: 2 Rooks, Bishop, Queen, 3 pawns, King\n   - Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with knight vs bishop)\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's knight on e7 is very strong, attacking black's queen\n   - Black's king is exposed on c6\n   - White's queen on f7 is threatening mate (Qe8#)\n   - Black's queen is under attack by the knight\n3. Immediate threats:\n   - White can play Qe8# if we don't defend\n   - Our queen is attacked by the knight on e7\n4. Evaluating the legal moves:\n   - c6d7: King moves away from danger but allows Qe8#\n   - c6c7: Doesn't solve the mate threat\n   - c6b7: Same problem\n   - c6d6: Still allows Qe8#\n   - c6b6: Still allows Qe8#\n   - c6b5: Moves king away but still allows mate\n   - e5e7: Queen takes knight, eliminating the immediate threat\n5. The only move that prevents immediate mate is e5e7 (queen takes knight). After this:\n   - White can recapture with Qxe7, but then we have Rxe7\n   - This leads to an endgame where Black is slightly better due to the bishop vs pawn structure\n6. All other moves lead to immediate checkmate (Qe8#).\nTherefore, the only viable move is to capture the knight with the queen:\n```\ne5e7\n```"
