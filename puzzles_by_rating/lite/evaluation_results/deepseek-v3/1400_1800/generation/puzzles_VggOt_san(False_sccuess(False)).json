When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Evaluation**: \n   - White has a queen (Q), bishop (B), rook (R), and pawns\n   - Black has a queen (q), rook (r), knight (n), and pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White has a strong attacking position\n2. **Key Features**:\n   - White's queen on f7 is extremely dangerous, attacking the h7 pawn and controlling key squares near Black's king\n   - Black's king is exposed on h8\n   - White's bishop on d6 controls important squares and pins the e7 rook\n   - Black's queen on g5 is threatening but not immediately dangerous\n3. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **f7g8**: Queen sacrifice leading to forced mate\n     - If Qxg8+, Kxg8\n     - Then Re8+ Rxe8\n     - Bxe8+ Kg7\n     - e6 with a winning position\n   - **d6f8**: Bishop takes rook with check\n     - Bxf8 Rxf8\n     - Qxf8+ Kh7\n     - White is up material but the attack slows down\n   - **e2e4**: Developing the rook but not immediately decisive\n4. **Best Move Analysis**:\n   - f7g8 is the most forcing and leads to a clear advantage:\n     - After Qxg8+ Kxg8\n     - Re8+ Rxe8\n     - Bxe8+ Kg7\n     - e6 and White has a winning endgame with two connected passed pawns and active pieces\n5. **Why not other moves**:\n   - Other queen moves don't lead to immediate decisive results\n   - Bishop moves allow Black to defend\n   - Rook moves are too slow\nThe forced mate sequence with the queen sacrifice is the most precise way to win.\n```\nf7g8\n```"
