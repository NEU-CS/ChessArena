When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: 3 pawns (b4, c4, e4) and a knight vs Black's pawns (a3, b6, h2) and knight\n- Material is roughly equal, but White's pawns are more advanced\n2. King safety:\n- White king is on b3, somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n- Black king is on e5, more centralized but also exposed\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White has connected passed pawns on b4/c4 which could be dangerous\n- Black's a3 pawn is a potential passed pawn\n- Black's h2 pawn is close to promotion\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Knight moves: g3h5 (attacking f6 knight), g3e2 (centralizing)\n- King moves: b3a4 (approaching a3 pawn), b3c3 (centralizing)\n- Pawn moves: c4c5 (advancing passed pawn)\n5. Key observations:\n- Black's h2 pawn is very dangerous - it's on the 2nd rank and could promote soon\n- White needs to either:\n  a) Stop the h-pawn's advance, or\n  b) Create counterplay with the passed pawns\n6. Evaluating options:\n- g3h5: Attacks the knight but doesn't address the h-pawn threat\n- b3a4: Goes after the a3 pawn but leaves h-pawn free\n- c4c5: Advances the passed pawn but allows ...h1=Q next move\n- g3e2: The knight can potentially swing to f4 or g3 to stop h-pawn\nThe best move is g3e2, preparing to bring the knight to f4 or g3 to block the h-pawn's promotion path. This addresses the most urgent threat while keeping options open for the passed pawns.\n```\ng3e2\n```"
