When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and position:\n- Black has: King (g6), pawns (g7, h5, c2), bishop (g2)\n- White has: King (e6), pawns (d4, h4), bishop (g5)\n- Black is to move (b in FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n- White's king is very active and close to Black's pawns\n- Black's c2 pawn is about to promote, but White's king can capture it\n- Black's bishop is very restricted by its own pawns\n- White's bishop controls important squares near Black's king\n3. Immediate threats:\n- If Black doesn't promote the c-pawn now, White can play Ke7 next move, attacking both the c2 pawn and g7 pawn\n- After Ke7, Black would lose material\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c2c1q (queen promotion)\n- c2c1r (rook promotion)\n- g6h7 (king move)\n- g2 moves (but none seem immediately useful)\n5. Analysis of promotions:\n- After c2c1q, White can play Ke7 attacking the new queen\n- After c2c1r, White can play Ke7 but the rook is less valuable to lose\n- Queen would be more powerful if we can defend it, but we can't\n6. King moves:\n- g6h7 doesn't help our position and allows White to capture pawns\n- Other king moves aren't legal\n7. Bishop moves:\n- All bishop moves either lose the bishop or don't help our position\n8. Best option:\n- Promote to rook (c2c1r) because:\n  - It's less valuable to lose than a queen\n  - After Ke7 Rxc1, we can play g6h7 and try to hold\n  - A queen would just be lost immediately to Ke7\n  - Other promotions (bishop/knight) don't give enough counterplay\n9. Calculating variations:\n- c2c1r Ke7 Rxc1 Kxd7\n- Then Black can play g6h7 and try to hold the position\n- Material would be roughly equal (bishop vs rook with pawns)\n10. Conclusion:\nPromoting to a rook is the most practical choice, as it minimizes losses and maintains some counterplay.\n```\nc2c1r\n```"
