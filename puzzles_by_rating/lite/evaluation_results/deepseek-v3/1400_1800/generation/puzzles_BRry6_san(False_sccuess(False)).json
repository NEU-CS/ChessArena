When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

First, let's understand the position:\n- White has a king on b2 and pawns on a3, b4, e4, f5, g4, h5\n- Black has a king on a4 and pawns on a7, b5, e5, f7, g5, h6\n- It's White's turn (w in FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n- This is a pawn endgame with kings\n- Both sides have passed pawns (White's f-pawn, Black's b-pawn)\n- The position is very blocked with many pawns fixed against each other\n- King activity will be crucial\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- b2c3: King moves towards center, but blocks own pawn on b4\n- b2c2: King stays passive\n- b2a2: King moves away from action\n- b2c1: King retreats, not helpful\n- b2b1: King retreats\n- b2a1: King retreats\n- f5f6: Advances the passed f-pawn\n4. The best move is clearly f5f6 because:\n- It advances White's most dangerous passed pawn\n- Creates immediate threats that Black must respond to\n- After f6, White can bring the king to support the pawn's advance\n- Other king moves don't accomplish anything concrete\n- The f-pawn is White's best winning chance in this endgame\n5. Calculating after f5f6:\n- Black's main responses would be ...Kb3 or ...Kb5\n- In either case, White can bring the king to support the pawn\n- The advanced f-pawn will tie down Black's king\nThis is the most active and principled move in the position. The other moves are either passive or don't improve White's position.\n```\nf5f6\n```"
