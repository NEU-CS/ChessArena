When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, rook, queen, pawns (b7, c6, e5, f7, h4)\n- White has: king, rook, queen, pawns (a6, b6, c2, e4, f2, g2)\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black has slightly more pawns but White has better structure)\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on c8\n- White has a passed pawn on b6 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on h8 is currently passive\n- White's queen on e2 is very active\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qe2xb5 winning the c6 pawn\n- White could push b6-b7 creating a passed pawn\n- White's rook on a6 is very active\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 (activating the rook towards the center)\n- f6g5 (queen move attacking e4 pawn)\n- c6c5 (challenging White's pawn structure)\n- h4h3 (creating some counterplay)\n5. Best move analysis:\n- h8g8 looks good to activate the rook and potentially double on the g-file\n- f6g5 attacks e4 pawn but after Qe2xg4, Black loses material\n- c6c5 allows b6xc5 improving White's pawn structure\n- h4h3 creates some counterplay but doesn't address the main issues\n6. Best choice:\nh8g8 is the most principled move, activating the rook and preparing to potentially double rooks on the g-file or swing to the queenside. It also keeps all options open while improving Black's worst-placed piece.\nThe move also prevents White from playing Qe2xb5 immediately as the rook would then defend b7.\n```\nh8g8\n```"
