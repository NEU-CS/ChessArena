When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material: Black has queen, rook, knight vs White's queen, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on a2. Black's king is somewhat exposed on c8.\n3. Threats: White has Qb6 attacking c5 pawn and knight. Black has queen on d1 with many potential threats.\n4. Black's pieces are more active, especially the queen and rook.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d1h5 - Queen moves to h5, threatening mate on a5 (Qa5#)\n2. e4f2 - Knight fork threatening white queen and checking king\n3. c7c6 - Rook defends c6 knight\n4. c5d3 - Knight moves with discovered attack on white queen\nLet's analyze d1h5:\n- Qh5 threatens Qa5# next move\n- White's only defense is Qb5, but then Qxb5 axb5 and Black is winning\n- Even if White finds Qc7+, we have Kb8 and still threaten mate\ne4f2:\n- Nf2+ forks king and queen\n- White must play Kb1 (only legal move)\n- Then Qxf2 and we're up a knight, but position remains complicated\nc7c6:\n- Defends the knight but doesn't create threats\n- White can play Qb5 with counterplay\nc5d3:\n- Discovered attack on queen\n- But after Qxd6, Nxb2 is messy\nBest move seems to be d1h5, creating an immediate mating threat that White cannot adequately defend against. After Qh5, White has no good way to prevent Qa5# next move.\n```\nd1h5\n```"
