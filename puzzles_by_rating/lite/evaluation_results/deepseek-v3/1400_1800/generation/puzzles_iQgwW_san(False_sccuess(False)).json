When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black has a king at e8, rook at h8, queen at d8, knight at e7, bishop at d7, pawns at a7,b7,d5,e6,f5,g7,h5\n- White has a king at e1, rook at a1 and h1, queen at d3, knight at d2 and f3, bishop at g2, pawns at a2,b2,c5,f4,h4\n- Black has castling rights (KQkq), but white has already moved their king's rook (h1 is still on starting square but e1 has moved)\n2. Key observations:\n- White has a strong pawn on c5, putting pressure on Black's d5 pawn\n- Black's knight on f5 is well placed but could be vulnerable\n- Black's king is still in the center, which could be dangerous\n- White has a space advantage with more advanced pawns\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Castling (e8g8): Gets the king to safety but leaves the f5 knight hanging\n- d5d4: Pushes the pawn to challenge white's center\n- f5h6: Moves the knight to a safer square\n- d8c7: Develops the queen to a more active position\n- e7f6: Develops the knight and defends d5\n4. Evaluating the best options:\n- e8g8 (castling) seems tempting but after 13. Nxd5 Nxd5 14. Qxd5, black loses material\n- d5d4 looks interesting, but after 13. Nxd4 Nxd4 14. Qxd4, black's position becomes loose\n- f5h6 is safe but passive\n- e7f6 is solid, defending d5 and developing a piece\n- d8c7 is active and connects the rooks\n5. Best move:\nd8c7 is the most flexible and active choice. It:\n- Develops the queen to a good square\n- Connects the rooks\n- Maintains pressure on the c5 pawn\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n- Prepares possible future moves like ...b6 or ...Rd8\nHere's the move:\n```\nd8c7\n```"
