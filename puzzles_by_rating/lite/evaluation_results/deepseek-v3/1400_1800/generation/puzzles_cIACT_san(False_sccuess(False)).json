When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Balance**: \n   - White has a rook, bishop, knight and 5 pawns\n   - Black has a rook, 2 bishops and 6 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal (Black has an extra pawn but White has better piece coordination)\n2. **King Safety**:\n   - White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n   - Black's king is on e7, not castled but relatively safe\n3. **Piece Activity**:\n   - White's rook on f1 is very active\n   - White's bishop on b3 is well placed, attacking f7\n   - Black's bishops are active but one is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n4. **Key Observations**:\n   - Black's rook on d8 is unprotected\n   - Black's bishop on c7 is unprotected\n   - White has potential to create threats against Black's king\n5. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **b3e6**: Capturing the bishop with check - very strong\n   - **f1f8**: Rook to the 8th rank - tempting but Black can defend\n   - **e2f4**: Developing knight - not the most forcing\n   - **b3d5**: Bishop move - less effective than e6\n6. **Best Move Analysis**:\n   - b3e6 is a discovered attack on the rook while capturing the bishop with check\n   - After b3e6+, Black must respond to the check:\n     - If Ke7xe6, then f1f8 wins the rook\n     - If Ke7d7, then e6xd7 wins a piece\n     - If Ke7f7, then e6xd7 still wins a piece\n   - In all cases, White wins material\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - b3e6 is the most forcing and winning move, gaining material immediately\n   - Other moves either don't win material or give Black time to defend\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb3e6\n```"
