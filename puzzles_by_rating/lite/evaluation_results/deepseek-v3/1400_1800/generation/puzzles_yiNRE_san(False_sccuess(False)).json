When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Queen, 2 knights, rook, pawns\n- Black has: Queen, rook, knight, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on b7 is very active, eyeing the f7 pawn and e7 king.\n- Black's king is exposed on e7.\n- White has a knight on d4 controlling key squares.\n- Black's rook on a4 is active but could be vulnerable.\n- Black's queen on g4 is centralized but could be harassed.\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qxe7+ or Nd4-f5+\n- Black needs to address king safety while maintaining counterplay.\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g4c8: Queen retreat to defend f7, but passive.\n- g4d7: Queen blocks the diagonal to the king, but allows Nf5+.\n- f7g8: King moves to safer square, but still exposed.\n- a4d4: Rook takes knight, but after Qxd4 White has strong initiative.\n- g4h5: Queen moves away, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n5. Best move considerations:\nWe need to both safeguard the king and maintain counterplay. The move g4d7 seems most principled:\n- Blocks the b7-g2 diagonal\n- Protects the f7 pawn\n- Maintains queen's central presence\n- After Nf5+, we can play Kf8\nOther moves either leave the king too exposed or give up too much material.\nThe move a4d4 is tempting but leads to: 1...a4d4 2.Qxd4 Qxd4 3.Nxd4 and White has a strong initiative with better piece coordination.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng4d7\n```"
