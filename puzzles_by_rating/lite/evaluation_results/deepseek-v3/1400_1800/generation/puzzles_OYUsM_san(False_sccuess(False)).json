When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (e4), Bishop (e3), Queen (c2), pawns\n- Black has: Rook (d3), Bishop (f6), Queen (g6), Knight (e5), pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's rook on d3 is very active and attacking White's bishop on e3\n- White's rook on e4 is very active and could potentially attack the black king\n- Black's knight on e5 is well placed but could be challenged\n- White's bishop on e3 is under attack and needs to be addressed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4e5: Capturing the knight with the rook, but after f6xe5 White loses material\n- e3d4: Moving the bishop to safety while attacking the rook\n- c2d3: Queen trade, but this would relieve pressure\n- e3a7: Bishop sacrifice, but not clearly winning\n- e4h4: Rook swing to attack the queen\n4. Best options:\n- e3d4 seems very strong because:\n  * Saves the bishop from attack\n  * Attacks the black rook on d3\n  * If rook takes bishop (d3xd4), then c2xd4 wins a rook for bishop\n  * If black moves the rook away, White maintains pressure\n5. Other moves:\n- e4h4 looks tempting to attack the queen, but after g6xh4 White loses material\n- c2d3 is a queen trade that simplifies the position unnecessarily\nAfter careful consideration, e3d4 is the most principled move, maintaining pressure while solving the immediate threat to the bishop.\n```\ne3d4\n```"
