When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Knight, Bishop, 4 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, Knight, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with extra pawn)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong knight on e5 and rook on h5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black has doubled rooks on the f-file\n- White's pawn structure is solid with passed c-pawn\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h5h8 - Rook sacrifice to expose the king\nb) e5f7 - Knight fork attacking rook and king\nc) e5g6 - Knight move attacking f8 rook\nd) e1e4 - Rook to e4 pinning the knight\n4. Analysis of h5h8:\n- h5h8 Rxh8\n- Then e5f7+ forking king and rook\n- Black would likely play Kxh8\n- Then f7xd8 winning the rook\nThis leads to material gain and exposes black's king\n5. Analysis of e5f7:\n- e5f7+ Kf8 (if Kh8, then h5h8+ wins)\n- Then h5h8+ Ke7\n- f7xd8+ Rxd8\nWhite wins a rook but black's king escapes\n6. Analysis of e5g6:\n- e5g6 Rf8\n- Then h5h8 Rxh8\n- g6xh8 and white is up material\nBut black can play Rf8 defending h8\n7. Analysis of e1e4:\n- e1e4 Nxc3\n- b3xe6 Rxe6\nLeads to complications but not clearly winning\nAfter careful consideration, h5h8 is the most forcing and decisive move, leading to a clear material advantage and exposing black's king. The rook sacrifice is sound because after:\n1. h5h8 Rxh8\n2. e5f7+ Kxh8 (forced, else loses the rook on e8)\n3. f7xd8 and white is up a rook\nThe move h5h8 is the most accurate and winning continuation.\n```\nh5h8\n```"
