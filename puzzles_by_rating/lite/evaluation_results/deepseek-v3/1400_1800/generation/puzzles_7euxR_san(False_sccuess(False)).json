When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has pawn on d5 vs Black's pawn structure, but Black has doubled rooks on d-file)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has two active bishops pointing at Black's kingside\n- Black's queen on e5 is somewhat exposed\n- Black has pressure on the d-file with doubled rooks\n- White's rooks are not optimally placed yet\n- Black's knight on c6 is defending the e5 queen\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3a7: Bishop sacrifice looks tempting but after ...Qxa7, White doesn't have enough compensation\n- d5c6: Removing the defender of e5 queen, but after ...bxc6 White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- g4f5: Pinning the queen to the king, which looks very strong\n- e1e2: Protecting the e3 bishop and connecting rooks\n- d1d4: Centralizing the rook and protecting d5 pawn\n4. Detailed analysis of g4f5:\n- After g4f5, Black's queen is pinned to the king\n- Black's options are limited:\n  - If Qxf5, then exf5 wins a queen for bishop\n  - If Q moves away (say Qe7), then f5xg6 opens the f-file with strong attack\n  - If Black tries to defend with ...g6, then f5xe6 is strong\n- This move creates immediate tactical threats while maintaining positional pressure\n5. Other moves don't create the same level of immediate threats:\n- e3a7 is too speculative\n- d5c6 gives up a strong passed pawn\n- Rook moves are too passive\n6. Conclusion: g4f5 is the most forcing and strongest move, creating immediate tactical threats against Black's exposed queen while maintaining all of White's positional advantages.\n```\ng4f5\n```"
