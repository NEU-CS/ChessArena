When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 5 pawns\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Queen, Bishop, Knight, 4 pawns\nBlack is down significant material (rook and knight)\n2. Immediate threats:\n- White's queen on g5 is attacking g7 pawn\n- White's bishop on f6 is very strong, pinning the e7 bishop to the king\n- White's rook on f1 is ready to swing to f7 or f8\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed with no pawn cover on the g-file\n- White has strong attacking potential with queen and rooks\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7f6: trading bishops but leaves g7 pawn hanging\n- f8f7: defending g7 but allows white to double rooks\n- g8h8: moving king to safety but passive\n- a3d6: queen move attacking f6 bishop while defending e7 bishop\nAfter careful consideration:\n- a3d6 is the most active move, creating counterplay by:\n  * Attacking the strong f6 bishop\n  * Defending the e7 bishop\n  * Potentially preparing ...d6-d5 counterplay\n  * Keeping the queen centralized\nOther moves either lose material or lead to passive positions. For example:\n- e7f6 Qxf6 and white's attack continues\n- f8f7 allows Rxf7 with a crushing attack\n- g8h8 is too passive\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na3d6\n```"
