When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully and determine the best move.\n**Position Analysis:**\n1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except Black has an extra pawn, but White has compensation with active pieces)\n2. White has a space advantage with pawns on e4 and g4\n3. White's pieces are well-developed:\n   - Bishop on c4 is very active\n   - Knight on f3 is centralized\n   - Rooks are connected\n4. Black's king is still in the center (though castled, the e5 pawn is a potential weakness)\n5. Black's dark-squared bishop is blocked by pawns on e5 and f6\n**Candidate Moves to Consider:**\n1. c4f7 - Bishop sacrifice on f7\n2. f3g5 - Knight jump to attack f7 and h7\n3. c1h6 - Bishop pin on the h6-c1 diagonal\n4. c3d5 - Knight centralization\n**Evaluating c4f7 (Bxf7+):**\nThis is a thematic sacrifice in such positions. After:\n- Rxf7 f3g5 (attacking both rook and h7)\n- Black would likely play Qe8 to defend\n- Then Qd5+ with strong attack\n**Evaluating f3g5:**\nThis develops the initiative but doesn't create immediate threats. Black can defend with h6 or Qe8.\n**Evaluating c1h6:**\nThis pins the knight to the king, but Black can play Kh8 or g5 to break the pin.\n**Evaluating c3d5:**\nThis centralizes the knight but allows Black to play exd4 in some lines.\n**Best Move:**\nThe bishop sacrifice c4f7 is the most forcing and promising continuation. It opens up Black's king and leads to a strong attack. Even if it's not immediately winning, it creates practical problems for Black to solve.\nAfter c4f7 Rxf7, f3g5 attacks both the rook and h7, maintaining the initiative. The king will be exposed and White can follow up with Qd5+ or other threats.\n```\nc4f7\n```"
