When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook, Knight, Bishop, 5 pawns\n- White has: Queen, Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could be dangerous\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- White's queen on a7 is very active\n- Black's knight on h4 is well-placed but could be vulnerable\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qa7xf7+ winning the pawn\n- White could play e5-e6 creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- White's rook on f1 is eyeing the f-file\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h4d8 - trading knight for rook but leaving queen exposed\nb) d3f5 - attacking the e5 pawn and centralizing queen\nc) g6f5 - challenging the e5 pawn directly\nd) f7f6 - challenging the e5 pawn and opening f-file\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d3f5 looks tempting but after exf5 gxf5, White's pawns become strong\n- g6f5 is met with exf6 and White's pawns remain strong\n- f7f6 is the most solid, challenging the e5 pawn while opening the f-file for our rook\nThe best move is f7f6, as it:\n1. Challenges White's strong e5 pawn\n2. Opens the f-file for our rook\n3. Doesn't create any weaknesses\n4. Maintains flexibility in our position\n```\nf7f6\n```"
