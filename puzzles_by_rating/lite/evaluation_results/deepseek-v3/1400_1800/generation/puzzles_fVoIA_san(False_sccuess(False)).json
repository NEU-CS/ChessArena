When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

First, let's understand the material and position:\n- White has king + knight + 3 pawns\n- Black has king + knight + 3 pawns\n- Material is equal (both sides have minor piece + 3 pawns)\n2. Key positional factors:\n- White's knight is very active on e5\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White has a protected passed pawn on d4\n- Black's knight is somewhat awkwardly placed on c4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Knight moves: e5f7, e5d7, e5g6, e5c6\n- King moves: g1g2, g1f2\n- Pawn moves: h2h3, h2h4\n4. Evaluating knight moves:\n- e5f7+ looks very strong - it forks the king and knight\n  After 1...Kxf7 2.d5 the passed pawn becomes dangerous\n  Or if 1...Kg5 2.Nxd8 and white wins material\n- Other knight moves don't create immediate threats\n5. Evaluating king moves:\n- King moves are safe but don't create threats\n- Black could then push his passed pawn\n6. Evaluating pawn moves:\n- Not as forcing as the knight fork\nThe best move is clearly e5f7, creating an immediate threat and either winning material or advancing the passed pawn with a strong position.\nHere's the move:\n```\ne5f7\n```"
