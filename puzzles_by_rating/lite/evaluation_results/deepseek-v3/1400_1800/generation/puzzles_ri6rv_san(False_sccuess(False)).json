When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, queen, pawns vs White's similar count). The position is dynamically balanced.\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is concerning. White has potential threats along the e-file and d-file.\n3. Piece activity:\n   - White's rooks are active on b3 and e1\n   - Black's bishop on b4 is well placed\n   - Black's queen on d7 is somewhat restricted\n4. Pawn structure:\n   - Black has doubled pawns on c-file\n   - White has a passed pawn on d5 which could become dangerous\nKey observations:\n- Black needs to address king safety urgently\n- The move e8g8 (castling) looks very attractive as it would:\n  * Get the king to safety\n  * Connect the rooks\n  * Prepare to bring the h8 rook into play\n- Other moves like e8f8 or h8g8 don't solve the king safety issue as effectively\n- The pawn break g6g5 could be considered, but it's premature before securing the king\nPotential threats to consider:\n- White could play Bxb4 at some point, but this would give Black the bishop pair\n- The d5 pawn is passed but not immediately dangerous\nAfter considering all options, castling (e8g8) is clearly the best move as it addresses the most pressing concern (king safety) while improving piece coordination.\n```\ne8g8\n```"
