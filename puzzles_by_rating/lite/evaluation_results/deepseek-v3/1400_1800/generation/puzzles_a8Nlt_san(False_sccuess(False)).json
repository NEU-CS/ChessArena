When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is in check from the white rook on g6 (the king is on e6)\n2. Black has several ways to get out of check:\n   - Move the king (e6f7, e6e7, e6d7, e6f5, e6e5)\n   - Block with the queen (d4f6)\n3. White has a very strong position with queen on b6 and rook on g6\n4. Black's queen is very active on d4\n5. Black has a rook on a3 but it's not immediately useful\nLet's evaluate each option:\n1. e6f7:\n   - Moves king towards white's rook and queen\n   - After Rg6xg7, black is in big trouble\n   - Bad move\n2. e6e7:\n   - King moves away but still exposes to potential checks\n   - White can play Qb6xc6 winning a piece\n   - Bad move\n3. e6d7:\n   - Moves king towards the corner\n   - White can play Qb6xc6 or Rg6xg7\n   - Still bad\n4. e6f5:\n   - Moves king towards center but exposes to Qb6f6+\n   - After Qb6f6+, black has to play Ke5 and white can play Rg6xg7\n   - Bad\n5. e6e5:\n   - Similar problems as e6f5\n   - White can play Qb6f6+ forcing Ke5 then Rg6xg7\n   - Bad\n6. d4f6:\n   - Blocks the check with the queen\n   - Now if white takes Qb6xc6, black can play Qf6xh4+\n   - This forces white's king to move (Kh2-g1/g2/g3)\n   - Then black can play Ra3-a2+ with strong counterplay\n   - This seems like the best option as it maintains material balance and creates counterplay\nThe other king moves all lead to immediate material loss or worse positions. Blocking with the queen is the only move that maintains some counterplay.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd4f6\n```"
