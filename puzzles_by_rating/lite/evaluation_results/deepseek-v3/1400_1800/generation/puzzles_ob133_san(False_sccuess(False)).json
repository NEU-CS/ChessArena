When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: rook, queen, rook, knight, 3 pawns\n- White has: queen, rook, rook, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black might be slightly better with queen vs queen and extra rook)\n2. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with White's rook on g4 eyeing it\n- White's king is safer on h1 but not completely secure\n3. Key threats:\n- White has strong pressure with queen on d4 and rook on g4\n- Black's queen on h7 is somewhat passive\n- Black's knight on d3 is well placed but needs support\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 (king moves away from attack)\n- a8g8 (doubling rooks on g-file)\n- d3e5 (knight centralization)\n- h7g6 (queen activation)\n5. Analysis of best options:\n- h8g8 looks passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n- a8g8 is interesting but White can play Qxg7+\n- d3e5 looks strong, attacking f3 and potentially eyeing f3/g4 squares\n- h7g6 activates the queen but leaves h8 vulnerable\n6. After d3e5:\n- Threatens Nxf5 winning a pawn\n- If White defends f5 (say with Rg3), Black can play Qg6 with counterplay\n- If White ignores, Nxf5 is strong as Qxf5 allows Rxf5 winning the queen\n7. Other moves like c7c5 or c4c3 don't address the immediate pressure.\nThe best move appears to be d3e5, activating the knight and creating counterplay while maintaining material balance.\n```\nd3e5\n```"
