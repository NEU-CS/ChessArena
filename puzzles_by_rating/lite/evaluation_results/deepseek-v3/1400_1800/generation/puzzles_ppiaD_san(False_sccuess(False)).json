When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, B, N, 4 pawns\n- Black has: Q, R, B, N, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has better piece coordination.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on c6 is very strong, attacking the black rook on c7\n- Black's queen on b6 is somewhat exposed\n- White's bishop on b5 pins the black knight on d6 to the queen\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) c6d8 - knight fork attacking king and rook\nb) c6e7 - knight fork attacking king and bishop\nc) b5a6 - bishop move attacking queen\nd) c1c5 - rook lift to attack queen\n4. Analysis of c6d8:\n- After c6d8, black must move king (kf8 or kh8)\n- Then white can play b5a6 attacking queen\n- Black queen must move, then white can capture rook on c7\n- This wins material\n5. Analysis of c6e7:\n- After c6e7, black can play kf7\n- Then b5a6 qa5, and white doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- Not as strong as c6d8\n6. Analysis of b5a6:\n- qxb5 axb5, then c6d8 wins the rook\n- But this trades queens when we have a strong attack\n- Not optimal\n7. Analysis of c1c5:\n- Attacks queen, but black can simply move queen\n- Doesn't create immediate threats\n8. Best move is c6d8, creating a royal fork that will win material:\n- After c6d8 kf8, b5a6 wins the queen or rook\n- Or after c6d8 kh8, b5a6 wins the rook on c7\nThe knight fork is decisive and leads to material gain. All other moves either don't capitalize on our strong knight position or allow black to defend.\n```\nc6d8\n```"
