When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a bishop pair vs White's knight pair, but balanced)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White has castled queenside (king on c1)\n- Black has pressure on the dark squares (bishop on e7, queen on g4)\n- White has a knight outpost on c4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8g8 (castling) - Gets the king to safety\n- g4f3 - Immediate threat to win the e3 bishop\n- f4f5 - Pushing the pawn to gain space\n- e7f6 - Developing the bishop with tempo\n4. Evaluating g4f3:\n- After Qxf3, Bxf3 Rxf3\n- Black wins a piece (bishop for pawn)\n- But White gets some compensation with open files\n5. Evaluating e8g8:\n- Safest option, gets king to safety\n- But may miss the tactical opportunity\n6. Evaluating f4f5:\n- Gains space, but allows White to consolidate\n- exf5 would open the e-file\n7. Best choice:\n- g4f3 is the most forcing and wins material\n- Even though the king remains in center, the material gain is significant\n- After Qxf3 Bxf3 Rxf3, Black is up a bishop for pawn\nThe tactical shot g4f3 is strongest here, winning material immediately.\n```\ng4f3\n```"
