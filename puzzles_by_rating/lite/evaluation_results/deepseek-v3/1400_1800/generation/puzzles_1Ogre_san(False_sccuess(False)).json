When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black king is on h6\n- White has a rook on g7 and king on g2\n- Black has a queen on c4 and pawns on b7, a7, c5, d4\n- White has pawns on b2, a2, h3\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed and White's rook is very active on the 7th rank\n- Black's queen is centralized but needs to be careful about potential forks\n- White has potential threats with the rook and advancing pawns\n3. Threats to consider:\n- White could play Rg7-g6+ next move, forcing the king away\n- White's h-pawn is advanced and could become dangerous\n4. Candidate moves to evaluate:\n- c4g8: Queen moves to g8 to defend against Rg7-g6+ by blocking\n- c4f7: Queen moves to f7 to defend against Rg7-g6+ by pinning\n- h6h5: King moves away from potential checks\n- b7b5: Pushing the pawn to create counterplay\n5. Analysis of best options:\n- c4g8 looks strong as it prevents Rg6+ and maintains queen activity\n- h6h5 is risky as it walks into potential discovered checks\n- b7b5 doesn't address the immediate threat\n- c4f7 is also good but less flexible than g8\n6. Best move:\nc4g8 is the most precise as it:\n- Blocks the immediate threat of Rg6+\n- Keeps the queen active\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any tactical shots for White\nThe move also prepares potential future checks on the g-file if needed.\n```\nc4g8\n```"
