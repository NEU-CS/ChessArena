When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns, King\n- Black: Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns, King\nMaterial is roughly equal, but positionally White has some advantages.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on c5\n- White's rook is very active on f6\n- Black has connected passed pawns on g5 and g3\n- White has a passed pawn on h3\n- Black's bishop is controlling important squares\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Rook moves - f6f7 looks interesting, threatening to check on f5\nb) King moves - f3g4 could help stop the g-pawn\nc) Bishop moves - d3h7 threatens to win the h6 pawn\nd) Pawn moves - h3h4 could create a passed pawn\n4. Analysis of best options:\n- f6f7: After f6f7, if Black plays ...Bd4 (defending f5), we can play Rf5+ Kd6 and the position remains complicated\n- f3g4: This stops the g3 pawn but allows Black to play ...Rh2 with counterplay\n- d3h7: This wins the h6 pawn but after ...Bxh7 Rxh7, Black's g-pawns become dangerous\n- h3h4: This creates a passed pawn and forces Black to deal with it. After gxh4, we can play Rxh6 with good chances\n5. Best move:\nh3h4 is the most forcing move, creating immediate threats and transforming the position in our favor. It:\n- Creates a passed h-pawn\n- Forces Black to take (gxh4) or allow hxg5\n- After gxh4, Rxh6 gives White a strong passed h-pawn\n- Even if Black doesn't take, hxg5 opens lines for our pieces\nThe other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black counterplay. h3h4 is the most principled and strongest move here.\n```\nh3h4\n```"
