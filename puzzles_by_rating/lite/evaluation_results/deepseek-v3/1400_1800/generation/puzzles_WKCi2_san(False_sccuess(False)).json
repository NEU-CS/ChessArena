When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black is in a difficult situation. White has strong pressure with:\n  - Rook on b5 attacking b7 pawn\n  - Queen on c7 pinning the e7 pawn to the king\n  - Passed pawn on e5\n- Black's king is exposed in the center\n- Black's queen is active on a3 but somewhat loose\n2. Key threats:\n- White threatens Rxb7 winning material\n- White has potential mating threats with the heavy pieces\n- The e5 pawn is strong and may advance\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a3d6: Queen moves to defend b7 while attacking d2 bishop\n- g8f6: Developing the knight to a natural square\n- e8f8: King moves to safety\n- d8e6: Blocking the e5 pawn with the knight\n4. Evaluating a3d6:\n- Defends b7 immediately\n- Attacks the bishop on d2\n- But white can play Qxd7+ winning the bishop after Kxd7 Rxb7+\n- Doesn't solve our problems\n5. Evaluating g8f6:\n- Develops a piece\n- But allows Rxb7 which is dangerous\n- After Rxb7 Qxb7 Qxd7+ Kxd7 Nxe5+ wins back material, but black's position remains bad\n6. Evaluating e8f8:\n- Gets the king to relative safety\n- But doesn't address the immediate threats\n- White can continue with strong play\n7. Evaluating d8e6:\n- Blocks the e5 pawn\n- Defends the c7 square\n- Prevents immediate material loss\n- Best practical chance to complicate matters\n8. Other moves:\n- Most alternatives either lose material immediately or don't address the threats\nConclusion: d8e6 is the most resilient move, blocking the dangerous pawn and defending key squares while keeping material balance. It's the best practical chance in a difficult position.\n```\nd8e6\n```"
