When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, 3 pawns\n- White has: king, queen, knight, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black may be slightly better with rook vs knight)\n2. Positional factors:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has a strong knight on c6 attacking Black's queen\n- Black's bishop on e4 is very active\n- White's queen on a6 is pinning Black's b6 pawn to the rook\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qxb6 or Nxe5\n- Black needs to address the attack on the queen while maintaining activity\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c7d6: Queen moves away from attack while maintaining pressure\n- c7b7: Queen moves to defend b6 pawn\n- e4g2: Bishop sac to expose White's king\n- d5f4: Knight moves to active square\n5. Analysis:\n- c7d6 looks most promising:\n  - Gets queen out of attack\n  - Maintains pressure on d-file\n  - Keeps options open for both defense and attack\n  - Doesn't weaken Black's position\n- e4g2 is tempting but after Kxg2, White's king might be okay with pieces around it\n- c7b7 is too passive and allows White to consolidate\n6. Best move:\nAfter considering all options, c7d6 is the most solid and flexible move that maintains Black's activity while addressing the immediate threat to the queen.\n```\nc7d6\n```"
