When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop, pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on d7\n- White has strong pressure with queen on b7 and bishop on a7\n- Black's knight on g4 is somewhat loose\n- Black's bishop on c4 is active but can be challenged\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7c7: Queen checks the king, forcing it to move\n- e1e8: Rook lift to the 8th rank with discovered attack potential\n- a7b8: Bishop sacrifice to expose the king\n- b7d5: Queen move attacking the bishop\n4. Deep analysis:\n- b7c7+ forces kd8 (only legal move)\n  - Then a7b8! is a strong sacrifice:\n    - If rxb8, Qxb8+ kd7 Qc7+ ke8 Qxc4 wins material\n    - If kxb8, Qb7+ kc8 Qa8+ kd7 Qxh8 wins the rook\n- e1e8 looks tempting but after rxe8, Qxe8+ kc7 and Black survives\n- b7d5 allows Qxd5 with counterplay\n5. Best continuation:\nThe queen check followed by bishop sacrifice leads to a winning position. After b7c7+ kd8 a7b8, White wins material in all variations.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb7c7\n```\nThis forces the king to move and sets up the decisive bishop sacrifice on the next move."
