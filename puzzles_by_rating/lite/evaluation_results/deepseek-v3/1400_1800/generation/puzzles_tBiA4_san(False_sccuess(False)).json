When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and position:\n- Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's rook, pawn and king\n- White's pawn on g7 is very advanced and threatening to promote\n- Black's king is on b2, White's king on g8\n- Black has pawns on a6 and b5\n2. Key observations:\n- White's g-pawn is one move away from promotion (g7-g8)\n- Black's bishop is currently blocking the promotion square g8\n- If the bishop moves, White can promote immediately\n- Black's king is too far away to help stop the pawn\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n- Bishop moves (c8d7, c8b7, etc.): All lose immediately to g7-g8=Q\n- King moves (b2b3, b2a3, etc.): Most don't help stop the pawn\n- Pawn moves: a6a5 or b5b4\n4. The only way to prevent immediate loss is to keep the bishop on the diagonal controlling g8:\n- c8d7, c8b7 etc. all abandon the diagonal\n- b5b4 is meaningless\n- a6a5 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose\n5. After a6a5:\n- White will play g7-g8=Q\n- Black can then capture with Bxg8\n- But then Rxg8 and White has a winning rook vs pawns endgame\nHowever, a6a5 is the only move that doesn't lose immediately. All other moves allow immediate promotion with check or mate. While the position is lost, we must make the move that prolongs the game the most.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na6a5\n```"
