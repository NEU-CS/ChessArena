When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen and pawns for both). Black has a rook on h8, bishop on e7, queen on g6, and pawns. White has knight on g5, queen on g3, king on g2, rook on a1, and pawns.\n2. King safety: White's king is somewhat exposed on g2, but not in immediate danger. Black's king is on e7, which is also exposed but protected by the bishop.\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on g6 is very active, eyeing the g2 king.\n- White's knight on g5 is excellently placed, attacking f7 and h7 squares near Black's king.\n- Black has a passed pawn on g4 that could become dangerous if advanced further.\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h7: Knight sac to remove the h8 rook that defends the king\n- g5f7: Knight sac attacking the king directly\n- g3h4: Queen move attacking Black's queen\n- a1h1: Rook swing to the open h-file\n5. Deep analysis:\n- g5h7 Rxh7, Qxg6 fxg6 - this leads to material equality but opens Black's king\n- g5f7 Kxf7, Qxg6+ Kxg6 - again material equality but exposes Black's king\n- g3h4 Qxh4, Nxh4 - wins the queen but gives up White's queen\n- a1h1 is interesting but doesn't create immediate threats\nThe most promising is g5h7, sacrificing the knight to:\n1) Remove the defensive rook\n2) Allow Qxg6 winning the queen\n3) Open Black's king position\nAfter g5h7 Rxh7, Qxg6 fxg6, White has queen for rook+knight, which is roughly equal material but with Black's king exposed. This seems the most forcing line that creates winning chances.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5h7\n```"
