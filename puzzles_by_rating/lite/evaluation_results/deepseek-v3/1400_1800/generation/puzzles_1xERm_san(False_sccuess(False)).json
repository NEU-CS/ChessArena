When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n- White has: Rook (b7), Rook (f1), Queen (b5), Bishop (g2), pawns (g3, f2)\n- Black has: Rook (d8), Rook (d2), Queen (c5), Bishop (d6), Knight (f6), pawns (f7, g7, h7)\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has Q+R+R+B vs Black's Q+R+R+B+N), but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on b5 is attacking the loose bishop on d6\n- White has a passed pawn on b7 that's well-supported\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8\n- Black's rook on d2 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's bishop on g2 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal\n3. Threats to consider:\n- White threatens Qxd6, winning a bishop\n- White could potentially play b8=Q soon\n- White might try to coordinate an attack on the black king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Defending the bishop: d8d7 (but blocks the bishop)\nb) Moving the bishop: d6e7 or d6c7\nc) Counterplay with c5c7 (attacking the rook)\nd) Knight moves like f6d5 or f6g4\n5. Evaluating c5c7:\n- Attacks the rook on b7\n- If Rxc7, then Qxc7 and we've traded a rook for queen+rook\n- But White can play Qxd6 first, then after cxb7 Qxd8+ is winning for White\n6. Evaluating d6e7:\n- Gets the bishop out of danger\n- But allows White to play b8=Q with strong pressure\n7. Evaluating f6d5:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks White's queen\n- After Qxd5, Rxd5 and we've traded queen for rook+knight\n- But White can play Qxd6 first, winning material\n8. Best option appears to be c5c7:\n- It creates immediate counterplay\n- Even if White takes the bishop first, we can take the rook with cxb7\n- The resulting position after Qxd6 cxb7 Qxd8+ Kxd8 would be roughly equal\nHowever, looking deeper, after c5c7 Qxd6 cxb7 Qxd8+ Kxd8, White has Q+R vs R+B+N, which might be better for White due to the active queen.\nAn alternative is d6c7, protecting the bishop while maintaining the rook on d8. After Qxc5 Rxc5, we have R+B vs R+B, which might hold better.\nAfter careful consideration, the most resilient move is:\n```\nd6c7\n```\nThis maintains material balance and keeps the position more defensible. The bishop is safe, and we avoid any immediate material losses while keeping our pieces coordinated."
