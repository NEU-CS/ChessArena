When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, rook, bishop, queen, knight, 5 pawns\n- White has: king, rook, knight, queen, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with White's rook on f3\n- Black's knight on e3 is well-placed but potentially trapped\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n3. Threats to consider:\n- White could play Qxh6, winning a pawn and opening the king\n- White could play Rxf7, sacrificing the rook but with unclear consequences\n- White's knight on f7 is very strong\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) g8h7 - moves king away from potential checks but seems passive\nb) e7f7 - trades queens but leaves knight hanging after Qxf7+ Rxf7 Nxg5\nc) e3f5 - activates knight and defends h6 pawn\nd) e7e6 - moves queen to safer square\ne) c8f5 - develops bishop with tempo on queen\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e3f5 seems most principled:\n  * Defends the h6 pawn against Qxh6\n  * Attacks White's queen, forcing it to move\n  * Opens potential for ...Bf5 later\n  * Keeps the knight active\nOther options either don't address threats or create new weaknesses.\nThe move e3f5 also maintains coordination between pieces and doesn't create any immediate weaknesses. It's the most flexible and active response to White's threats.\n```\ne3f5\n```"
