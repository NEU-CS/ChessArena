When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black: Rook, Knight, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on g1\n- Black king is active on f4 but also exposed\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's knight on d4 is very strong, attacking e2 and f3 squares\n- White's rook on e7 is very active\n- Black's rook on e3 is pinning the h3 pawn to the king\n- Black's king is dangerously close to White's pawns\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8 (queening the rook) - but this seems pointless as it doesn't accomplish anything\n- d5g8 - bishop move threatening mate, but Black can defend with ...Ke5\n- e4e5 - pawn push to open lines, but allows ...Nf3+ winning the g2 pawn\n- g2g3 - solid move, prevents ...Nf3+ and creates luft for the king\n- d5f7 - bishop move attacking the rook, but Black can just move the rook\n5. Best move analysis:\ng2g3 seems most prudent because:\n- It prevents any ...Nf3+ tricks\n- Creates an escape square for the king\n- Maintains all of White's active pieces\n- Doesn't allow any counterplay\nOther moves either don't accomplish much or allow Black counterplay.\n6. Potential threats after g2g3:\nBlack might try ...Ke5 or ...f5, but White's pieces remain active and can defend.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng2g3\n```"
