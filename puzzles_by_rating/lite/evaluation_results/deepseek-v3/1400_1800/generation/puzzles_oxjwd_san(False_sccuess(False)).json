When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black: Rook, Knight, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs knight)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a knight on d4 attacking f3 pawn\n- Black's rook is on c2, very active\n- White's bishop is very strong on f7, eyeing the black king\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Bishop moves:\n- f7g8: attacking the black king, but black can play ...Kxg8\n- f7e8: same idea, but black can play ...Kxe8\n- f7h5: threatens mate on g6, but black has ...g6\nb) Rook moves:\n- a1c1: challenging the active black rook\n- a1b1: preparing to swing to b7\nc) King moves:\n- g1h1: getting away from potential checks\n4. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...Nxf4 or ...Nxb3\n- White can create threats against the black king\n5. Best move analysis:\n- f7g8! is very strong because:\n  - It forces the black king to take: ...Kxg8\n  - Then a1g1+ forces the king to h8\n  - Then f4f5 with the idea of f5-f6-f7 is crushing\n  - Black has no good defense against this plan\nOther moves:\n- a1c1 Rxc1+ loses the rook\n- g1h1 allows ...Nxf4\n- f4f5 immediately allows ...Nxf5\nThe bishop sacrifice is the most forcing and leads to a winning attack.\nFinal answer:\n```\nf7g8\n```"
