When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully. Here's the FEN: `8/3P4/PK6/8/1P2k3/5p2/8/r7 b - - 0 55`\nKey features of the position:\n1. Black has a king at e4 and a rook at a1\n2. White has a king at b6, pawns at a6, b4, and d7 (passed pawn)\n3. Black has a pawn at f3\n4. White's d-pawn is very advanced and threatening to promote\nFirst, let's evaluate the threats:\n- White's d7 pawn is one move away from queening\n- White's b4 pawn is protected by the king\n- Black's f3 pawn is not immediately threatening\nOur priorities should be:\n1. Stop the d-pawn from promoting\n2. Try to create counterplay with our rook\n3. Keep our king active\nLooking at the legal moves:\n**King moves (e4):**\n- e4f5: moves toward the d-pawn but doesn't block it\n- e4e5: same as above\n- e4d5: blocks the pawn! This looks promising\n- e4f4/e4d4: doesn't help\n- e4e3/e4d3: moves away from the action\n**Rook moves (a1):**\n- a1a6: pins the a6 pawn to the king\n- a1a5/a1a4/a1a3/a1a2: less useful\n- a1h1/a1g1/etc: rook lifts to potentially attack the d-pawn\n- a1d1: directly attacks the d-pawn\n**Pawn moves (f3):**\n- f3f2: doesn't help immediately\nThe most critical move seems to be either:\n1. e4d5 - blocking the pawn with the king\n2. a1d1 - attacking the pawn with the rook\nLet's analyze e4d5:\nAfter e4d5, White can play d7d8Q, but then we have a1d1+ skewering the new queen to the king. White would have to play Kc6 or Kc7, and we can capture the queen with our king.\nBut let's see a1d1 first:\nAfter a1d1, White can play d7d8Q, and we take with the rook. Then White has Kc6 attacking our rook, but we can move it away while our king approaches.\nBetween these two, e4d5 seems more forcing as it physically blocks the pawn and maintains more options. After e4d5, if White tries to push d7d8Q, we have a1d1+ winning the queen.\nOther moves like a1a6 are less direct, as after a1a6 White can just push d7d8Q and we're in trouble.\nTherefore, the best move is to block the pawn with the king:\n```\ne4d5\n```"
