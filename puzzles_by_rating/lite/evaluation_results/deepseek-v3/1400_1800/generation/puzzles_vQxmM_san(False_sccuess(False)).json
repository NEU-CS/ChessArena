When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, queen, bishop, knight vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight). The pawn structure is complex but roughly balanced.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7\n- White has pressure on the b-file with the queen on b3\n- Black's pawn on d4 is weak and potentially vulnerable\n- Black's rooks are doubled on the f-file but not particularly active\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6g5: Developing the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- e6d8: Centralizing the knight and defending the rook\n- e7f7: Consolidating the queen's position\n- g6g5: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n4. Evaluating the best options:\n- f6g5 looks tempting to activate the bishop, but after Bxg5 Nxg5 Qxg5, White gets some initiative\n- e6d8 is solid but somewhat passive\n- e7f7 seems most logical, connecting the rooks and defending the f6 bishop\n- g6g5 could be interesting but weakens the king position\n5. Potential threats:\nWhite could play Qb5 attacking the a5 pawn, or try to open lines against Black's king. e7f7 helps prevent both by keeping the queen centralized and defending key squares.\n6. After e7f7, possible continuations:\n- If White plays Qb5, Black can respond with ...a4\n- The rooks become more connected\n- The bishop on f6 remains protected\nConclusion: e7f7 is the most solid move that maintains Black's position without creating weaknesses while improving piece coordination.\n```\ne7f7\n```"
