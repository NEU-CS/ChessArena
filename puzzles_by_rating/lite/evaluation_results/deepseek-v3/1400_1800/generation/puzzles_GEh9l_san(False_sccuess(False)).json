When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Black has queen, 2 rooks, bishop, knight vs White's queen, rook, bishop. Black is up a rook and knight for a pawn - significant material advantage.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8. White has a bishop on g5 eyeing the king.\n3. Key threats:\n- White's queen on e3 is very active and could create threats\n- White's rook on d1 is well placed\n- Black's queen on h5 is active but somewhat loose\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h6 - attacking the bishop, but after g5xh6, White gets open g-file\n- e2f4 - knight move attacking white's queen\n- a8f8 - doubling rooks on the f-file\n- f7f3 - rook sacrifice to expose white's king\n- c6e4 - bishop move attacking queen\n5. Best options:\n- e2f4 looks very strong, attacking the queen while developing the knight\n- After Qe3 moves (likely Qe2), we can follow up with ...Rf3! with devastating threats\n- Other moves either don't improve our position or allow counterplay\n6. Calculating e2f4:\n- If 24. Qe2 then 24...Rf3! 25. Qxf3 Nxf3 and Black wins material\n- If 24. Qf3 then 24...Nxg5 and Black wins a piece\n- If 24. Qd3 then 24...Rf3! is still strong\nThe move e2f4 both develops the knight and creates immediate threats against White's queen while maintaining our material advantage. It's the most forcing and strongest move in the position.\n```\ne2f4\n```"
