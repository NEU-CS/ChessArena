When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.\nCurrent position:\n- White king at c3, pawn at h3\n- Black king at e4, pawn at f4\n- White to move\nKey observations:\n1. This is a king and pawn endgame where both sides have passed pawns.\n2. Black's pawn is further advanced (f4 vs h3) and closer to promotion.\n3. White's king is currently closer to Black's pawn than Black's king is to White's pawn.\n4. The outcome will depend on who can promote first or stop the opponent's pawn.\nLet's evaluate each legal move:\n1. c3c4 (Kc4):\n   - Moves king closer to Black's pawn\n   - After Kc4, Black would likely push f3 (f4f3)\n   - Then Kd3 to block the pawn\n   - This seems like the most direct way to stop Black's pawn\n2. c3b4 (Kb4):\n   - Moves king away from both pawns\n   - Allows Black to push f3 with tempo\n   - Not ideal\n3. c3b3 (Kb3):\n   - Doesn't make progress toward either pawn\n   - Wastes time\n4. c3d2 (Kd2):\n   - Moves king toward Black's pawn but not as directly as Kc4\n   - Allows f3 with tempo\n5. c3c2 (Kc2):\n   - Retreats the king\n   - Allows Black to make progress with f3\n6. c3b2 (Kb2):\n   - Similar to Kb3, wastes time\n7. h3h4 (h4):\n   - Advances White's pawn but doesn't address Black's more dangerous pawn\n   - Black can respond with Ke3, getting their king closer to stop White's pawn\nThe best move is c3c4 (Kc4) because:\n- It directly approaches Black's passed pawn\n- After f3, White can play Kd3 to block the pawn\n- This creates a race where White's king can stop Black's pawn while White's h-pawn advances\n- Other moves either waste time or don't address the immediate threat of Black's pawn\nThe move h3h4 is tempting but premature - we must first stop Black's pawn from promoting.\n```\nc3c4\n```"
