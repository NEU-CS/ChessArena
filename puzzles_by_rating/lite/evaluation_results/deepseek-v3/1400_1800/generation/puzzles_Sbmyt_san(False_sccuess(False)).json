When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black has a knight on c5 and a bishop on g7, both actively placed\n- White has a strong knight on d5 that's well-supported\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White has castled\n- Black has the option to castle queenside (O-O-O)\n2. Key observations:\n- White's knight on d5 is very strong and needs to be challenged\n- Black's king safety is a concern\n- The h8 rook is currently inactive\n- The bishop on g7 is blocked by its own pawn on e7\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8g8 (castling kingside): Improves king safety but leaves the d5 knight unchallenged\n- c5d7: Challenges the strong knight but blocks the d-file\n- c5e6: Attacks the knight while developing\n- g7f8: Prepares to castle while challenging the knight\n4. Evaluating the best options:\n- c5e6 looks tempting but after dxe6 fxe6, White gets a strong pawn center\n- c5d7 blocks the d-file but after Nxd7 Qxd7, Black's position remains cramped\n- e8g8 (castling) is safe but doesn't address the knight issue\n- g7f8 is interesting as it prepares castling while challenging the knight\n5. Best move:\ng7f8 is the most flexible and principled move:\n- Prepares to castle kingside\n- Challenges the strong knight on d5\n- Keeps options open for the bishop (can go back to g7 or elsewhere)\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\nThe alternatives either don't address the knight issue or create other problems. g7f8 maintains flexibility while improving Black's position.\n```\ng7f8\n```"
