When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal (Black has bishop pair vs White's bishop and knight)\n2. White has a strong passed pawn on f6 supported by the bishop on g7\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with White's queen on h4 and rook on f3 eyeing f7\n4. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated with the queen on d8 and bishop on e5\n5. White's king is in a precarious position on h1\nThe most pressing threats:\n- White could play Qxh7+ next move if we don't address it\n- The f6 pawn is very dangerous and needs to be stopped\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5f6 - capturing the dangerous pawn with the bishop\n   - After Bxf6, White can play Qxh7+ Kf8 Qh8+ Ke7 Qxg7 and White is winning\n   - So this seems bad\n2. e8f8 - moving the king away from potential checks\n   - This doesn't address the immediate threats and leaves the h7 pawn hanging\n3. d8f6 - queen takes the pawn\n   - After Qxf6, White can play Qxh7+ Kf8 Qh8+ Ke7 Qxg7 and again White is winning\n4. e5g3 - bishop moves to g3, blocking the queen's path to h7\n   - This seems interesting as it prevents Qxh7+\n   - White could respond with Qg4 or Qh3, but we gain time\n5. h7h5 - pushing the pawn to block the queen\n   - After h5, White can play Qg5 maintaining pressure\nAfter careful consideration, e5g3 seems best because:\n- It prevents the immediate Qxh7+ threat\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It keeps our bishop active\n- It doesn't allow White any immediate tactical blows\nOther moves either allow White's queen to infiltrate or don't address the threats properly.\nHere's the move:\n```\ne5g3\n```"
