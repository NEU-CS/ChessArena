When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has queen, 2 rooks, knight vs White's queen, 2 rooks, bishop). The position is roughly balanced.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong pawn on e5, controlling d6 and f6\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's queen on f4 is very active\n- Black's rooks are not optimally placed (doubled on f-file)\n- Black's knight on c6 is under pressure from White's bishop on b5\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qf6, threatening mate on g7\n- White could double rooks on the b-file against b7\n- White has potential to open the position with f4-f5\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c8d7: Gets the queen off the vulnerable diagonal and connects rooks\n- e8e7: Moves the rook to a more active file\n- c6e5: Challenges White's strong pawn and opens lines\n- d5d4: Creates counterplay in the center\n5. Best move analysis:\n- c8d7 looks solid, but doesn't create counterplay\n- e8e7 is interesting but leaves the queen exposed\n- d5d4 is tempting but after exd4, White's pieces become more active\n- c6e5 is the most dynamic choice, challenging White's center and opening lines for Black's pieces\nAfter c6e5:\n- If White takes: dxe5 opens the d-file for Black's rooks\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with ...Qd7 or ...Nc4\nThis move solves multiple problems at once - it challenges White's center, activates the knight, and opens lines for Black's pieces.\n```\nc6e5\n```"
