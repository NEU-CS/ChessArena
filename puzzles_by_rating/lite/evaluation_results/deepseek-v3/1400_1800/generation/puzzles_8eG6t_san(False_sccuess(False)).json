When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, bishop (material is equal)\n- But White has more active pieces and better coordination\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has strong pressure on the dark squares (bishop on b3, queen on a3)\n- Black's queen on d4 is somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed g-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) d7d8 - promoting the rook to queen (but black can take with bishop: d8xd8 Qxd8 and we lose material)\nb) b3d5 - attacking black's queen while discovering attack on rook\nc) a3f8 - threatening mate (but black can defend with Qf6)\nd) d7g7 - sacrificing rook to expose black's king\ne) a3e7 - attacking the bishop and threatening mate ideas\n4. Best move analysis:\n- b3d5 looks very strong:\n  - Attacks black's queen\n  - Discovers attack on black's rook (b5)\n  - After Qxd5, Rxb5 wins a rook\n  - If black moves queen away (say Qe5), then Rxb5 wins the rook\n  - Even if black tries Qxd3, we have Qxd3 and still win the rook next move\n5. Other options:\n- a3e7 is also interesting but after Bxe7 Rxe7, black can defend\n- d7g7 is tempting but after Rxg7+ Kxg7, we don't have immediate follow-up\n- b3d5 gives us a clear material advantage\nAfter careful consideration, b3d5 is the strongest move as it wins material while maintaining all our threats.\n```\nb3d5\n```"
