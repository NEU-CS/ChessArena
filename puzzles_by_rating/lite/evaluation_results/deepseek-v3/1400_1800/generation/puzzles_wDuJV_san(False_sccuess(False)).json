When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a passed pawn on d6 that is very advanced\n2. Black's rook is currently passive on h1\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed near the center\n4. White's rook is actively placed on f6\n5. Black has two pawns that could potentially promote (f5 and h2)\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d6d7 - advancing the passed pawn\n2. f6f4 - pinning the black king\n3. b4c5 - bringing king closer to center\n4. f6f8 - controlling the 8th rank\nLet's evaluate these:\n1. d6d7:\n   - Immediately threatens d7d8=Q\n   - Black would likely respond with ...Rd1 to stop promotion\n   - Then we could play Rf6xf5, but after ...Ke4, black's king becomes active\n2. f6f4+:\n   - Pins the black king\n   - Black must play ...Kxf4 (other moves lose immediately)\n   - Then d6d7 and the pawn queens\n   - But after ...Rd1, we'd have to give up the rook for the h-pawn\n   - Might lead to a drawn king and pawn endgame\n3. b4c5:\n   - Centralizes the king\n   - But doesn't create immediate threats\n   - Black could play ...Ke4 with counterplay\n4. f6f8:\n   - Controls the 8th rank\n   - Prevents black rook from becoming active\n   - Prepares to bring rook back to defend if needed\n   - Maintains all options\nAfter careful consideration, f6f8 seems most flexible and maintains all our advantages. It prevents black's rook from becoming active while keeping all our options open regarding the d-pawn and king activity.\nThe move f6f8:\n- Controls the 8th rank\n- Prevents black rook from getting to the d-file\n- Maintains pressure on f5 pawn\n- Keeps options to either push d-pawn or bring king forward\nOther moves either allow counterplay or don't maximize our advantages. f6f8 is the most solid and flexible choice.\n```\nf6f8\n```"
