When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has minor piece activity advantage)\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8 with weak pawn cover\n3. Piece activity: White's pieces are very active (e.g. e5 knight, g5 bishop, e2 queen)\n4. Key observations:\n   - Black's queen on d7 is awkwardly placed, defending b7 bishop\n   - Black's knight on f6 is pinned to the queen by our bishop on g5\n   - Our knight on e5 is very strong\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5f7 - Knight fork attacking queen and rook\n2. g5f6 - Capturing the pinned knight\n3. d3h7 - Bishop sacrifice to expose the king\n4. e2h5 - Queen move threatening mate on h7\nLet's evaluate these:\n1. e5f7: After Qxf7, Bxf6 and we win a pawn but lose initiative\n2. g5f6: Qxf6, Nxf6+ Rxf6 and we have a small edge but nothing decisive\n3. d3h7: Kxh7, Qh5+ Kg8, Qxf7+ Kh8 and we have strong attack but no immediate mate\n4. e2h5: Direct threat of Qxh7#. Black must respond with g6, then we can play Bxf6!\nThe best move is e2h5 because:\n- It creates an immediate mating threat\n- After forced g6, we can capture the knight with Bxf6\n- Black's position collapses as their king remains exposed\n- All other moves give Black more defensive resources\nThe sequence would be:\n1. e2h5 g6 (forced)\n2. g5f6 Qxf6\n3. Nxg6+! winning the queen\nThis is the most forcing and decisive continuation.\n```\ne2h5\n```"
