When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White: Q+R+N+N vs Black: Q+R+N+N). However, White's pieces are more actively placed.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has strong pressure on the queenside with the queen on b5 and knight on d4\n- Black's knight on g4 is threatening to take on f2 or h2\n- Black's dark-squared bishop is very active on h2, pinning the g3 pawn\n- White's king is somewhat exposed due to the h-file being open\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) b5b7 - Queen takes pawn with check, but after ...Qf7, White doesn't gain much\nb) d4e6 - Knight fork attacking queen and rook, but Black can play ...fxe6\nc) d4f5 - Centralizing the knight and attacking the queen\nd) h1g2 - Unpinning and defending against ...Nxh2\n4. Best options:\n- d4f5 looks strong as it forces the black queen to move while improving the knight's position\n- h1g2 is solid, dealing with the immediate threat to the king\n5. Tactical considerations:\nAfter d4f5 Qxf5, Rxf5 wins the queen but after ...Nxh2, Black gets strong counterplay\nHowever, after d4f5 Qe7, White can play Qxe5 with a strong initiative\n6. Best move:\nd4f5 is the most active move, maintaining pressure while dealing with threats. It forces Black to react and keeps the initiative.\n```\nd4f5\n```"
