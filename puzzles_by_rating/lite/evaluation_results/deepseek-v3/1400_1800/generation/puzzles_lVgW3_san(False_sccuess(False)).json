When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Positional Assessment**:\n   - Black has a queenside pawn majority (a5, b5, c4 vs White's a1, c3)\n   - White has a strong pawn center (d4, e5) and space advantage\n   - Black's king is slightly exposed with the f8 rook not connected to the other rook\n   - White has pressure on the f6 knight via the e5 pawn and queen on f3\n2. **Key Considerations**:\n   - The f6 knight is under pressure and needs to be addressed\n   - Black's queen is somewhat exposed on d8\n   - The h6 pawn is weak and could become a target\n   - Black needs to find active counterplay\n3. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **f6h5**: Challenges White's queen and potentially trades it\n   - **d8e7**: Centralizes the queen and connects rooks\n   - **a8b8**: Prepares to activate the rook via b6\n   - **g7g5**: Creates counterplay on the kingside\n4. **Move Analysis**:\n   - f6h5 looks tempting but after Qxh5 Nxh5, White gets a strong passed pawn on e5\n   - d8e7 is solid but doesn't create counterplay\n   - a8b8 is slow and allows White to consolidate\n   - g7g5! is the most dynamic choice, creating immediate counterplay:\n     * Opens the g-file for the rook\n     * Challenges White's pawn structure\n     * Prepares potential ...Ng4 ideas\n     * If White takes g5, Black can recapture with hxg5 opening the h-file\n5. **Conclusion**:\nThe move g7g5 creates the most imbalance and counterplay, preventing White from slowly improving their position. It's the most principled move in this position, activating Black's pieces and creating tactical possibilities.\n```\ng7g5\n```"
