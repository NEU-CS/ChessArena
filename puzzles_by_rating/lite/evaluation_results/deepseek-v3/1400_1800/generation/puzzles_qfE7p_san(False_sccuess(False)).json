When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight, 5 pawns\n- White has queen, rook, knight, bishop, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but black has more active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very strong, eyeing g8 and h7\n- Black's bishop on h5 is pinned to the king by white's queen\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on d8\n- White has pressure on the e-file with rook on e1\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is white playing Qxh7+ winning the h5 bishop\n- Also potential threats like Qg8+ or Qf7+\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h8g8 - defends against Qg8+ but doesn't solve Qxh7+\nb) h5e8 - unpins the bishop and defends against Qg8+\nc) f4b8 - removes bishop from attack and defends c7\nd) a5c7 - queen move that defends e5 and attacks e1 rook\n5. Best move analysis:\n- h5e8 seems most urgent as it:\n  * Unpins the bishop\n  * Defends against Qg8+\n  * Maintains control of f7\n  * Keins the bishop pair\n- Other moves either don't address the pin or leave other weaknesses\n6. After h5e8, possible continuation:\n- If white takes Qxh7, then black can play Qxh7 Rxh7 with material equality\n- The position remains dynamically balanced\nTherefore, the best move is to unpin the bishop and defend against mate threats while maintaining piece activity.\n```\nh5e8\n```"
