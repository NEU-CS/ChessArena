When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: 1 queen, 1 rook, 1 knight, 2 pawns\n- Black has: 1 queen, 1 rook, 1 bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with knight vs bishop)\n2. Positional factors:\n- White's knight on f6 is very strong, attacking Black's queen and rook\n- White's queen on f4 is very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n- Black's pawn on d4 is passed but isolated\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White has Qxh5+ threat next move\n- White's knight is attacking Black's queen and rook\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Qf6 - counterattacking the knight but allows Qxh5+\nb) Rd8g8 - protecting against Qxh5+ but leaves queen hanging\nc) Qe8 - protecting against Qxh5+ and keeping queen safe\nd) Qd7 - moving queen away but still allows Qxh5+\n5. Best defensive move:\n- Qe8 seems best as it:\n  - Prevents Qxh5+\n  - Keeps queen safe from knight\n  - Maintains connection between rook and queen\n  - Doesn't create new weaknesses\nOther options:\n- Rd8g8 allows Qxf6\n- Qf6 allows Qxh5+ followed by Qxf6\n- Qd7 still allows Qxh5+\n6. Long-term considerations:\nAfter Qe8, White might play Qxh5 but then we have Qxe5 with counterplay\nAlternatively White could play Qf3 or other moves, but we've stabilized our position\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne7e8\n```"
