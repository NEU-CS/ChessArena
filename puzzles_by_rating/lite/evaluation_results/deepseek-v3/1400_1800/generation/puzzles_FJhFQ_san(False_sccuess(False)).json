When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, 2 rooks, bishop, pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, knight, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has strong pressure on the f-file with queen and rook\n- Black's queen is active but somewhat loose on a3\n- White's bishop on h4 is very active, eyeing the black king\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) f5h7 - Queen sac to open the king\nb) h4d8 - Bishop sac to remove defender\nc) h4f6 - Bishop takes pawn with discovered attack\nd) e2e4 - Central pawn push\n4. Analyzing f5h7:\n- Qxh7+ Kxh7\n- Rh4+ Kg8\n- Bf6! threatening mate on h8\n- Black can defend with ...Qd6 but White has strong attack\n5. Analyzing h4d8:\n- Bxd8 Rxd8\n- Qxf7+ Kh8\n- Qf6+ Kg8\n- Re7 with strong pressure but not immediately decisive\n6. Analyzing h4f6:\n- Bxf6 gxf6\n- Qxf6 Rg7\n- White has strong attack but Black can defend\n7. Analyzing e2e4:\n- Solid but doesn't exploit the immediate attacking chances\nThe most forcing and strongest line appears to be f5h7, sacrificing the queen to open up Black's king. After:\n- f5h7 Kxh7\n- h4f6+! (discovered check) Kg8\n- d4h4 with mate threats that Black cannot adequately defend against.\nThe bishop on f6 cuts off escape squares and the rook coming to h4 will be deadly. Black has no good defense against the mating threats.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf5h7\n```"
