When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black has a rook on a8 and f8, bishop on e7 and d7, queen on c7, knight on c6, pawns on a7, b7, c5, d5, e6, f6, g7, h6\n- White has a rook on a1 and f1, bishop on d3, queen on c2, knight on d2 and h4, pawns on a2, b3, c3, d4, e5, g2, h3\n- Black's king is on g8, white's king is on g1\n2. Key observations:\n- White has a strong knight on h4 eyeing f5\n- Black's pawn structure is solid but slightly passive\n- White has more space with the e5 pawn\n- Black's light-squared bishop is somewhat restricted by its own pawns\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5d4: This would open the position and challenge White's center\n- f6f5: This challenges White's e5 pawn but weakens e6\n- c6e5: This knight move attacks White's bishop on d3\n- g7g5: This could try to kick White's knight but weakens the kingside\n4. Evaluating c6e5:\n- Attacks the bishop on d3\n- If White takes with Bxe5, we can recapture with fxe5, opening the f-file for our rook\n- This would also relieve pressure on our d5 pawn\n- The knight would be well-placed on e5\n5. Other moves:\n- c5d4 would be met with c3d4, keeping White's strong center\n- f6f5 would weaken e6 and allow exf6 en passant\n- g7g5 is too weakening and allows Nh4xg5\n6. Best move seems to be c6e5, improving our knight position and challenging White's bishop. This creates immediate pressure and forces White to make a decision about the bishop.\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\nc6e5\n```"
