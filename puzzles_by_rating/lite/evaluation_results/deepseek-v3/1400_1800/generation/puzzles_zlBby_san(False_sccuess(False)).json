When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, knight, queen, pawns vs White's queen, bishop, rook, pawns). \n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's king is exposed (castled kingside but with open h-file)\n   - White's queen is very active on d4\n   - Black's knight on e4 is under attack by White's pawn on c3\n   - Black's bishop on c6 is blocked by its own pawn on b7\n   - White has pressure along the d-file with rook on d1\n3. Threats:\n   - White could play Qxe4 next move, winning the knight\n   - White could increase pressure with moves like Rd2 or Bf4\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e4d6: Moving the knight to safety while attacking the c4 square\n   - e4g5: Moving the knight to attack White's bishop on g3\n   - f6d8: Queen retreat to defend the knight\n   - e8g8: King safety by connecting rooks\n5. Evaluating the best option:\n   - e4d6 looks interesting but allows White to play Qxe6 after fxe6\n   - f6d8 is passive and allows White to maintain initiative\n   - e8g8 is solid but doesn't address the knight issue\n   - e4g5 is the most active, attacking the bishop and maintaining the knight's central presence\n6. After e4g5:\n   - If White takes: Bxg5 Qxg5 maintains material equality\n   - If White doesn't take, Black can consider ...Nxf3+ or ...Qh4 next\nThe move e4g5 solves the immediate threat to the knight while creating counterplay against White's bishop. It's the most active and principled response.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne4g5\n```"
