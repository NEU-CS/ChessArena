When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Evaluation**: \n   - Black has a rook, queen, knight, pawn vs White's rook, queen, knight, bishop, pawn\n   - Material is roughly equal (Black might be slightly down)\n2. **King Safety**:\n   - Black's king is exposed on g8 with White's knight on g4 and bishop on h3 eyeing the king\n   - White has potential threats against the black king\n3. **Key Observations**:\n   - White has pressure on the f5 pawn with their knight on g4\n   - Black's rook on e8 is active but could be vulnerable\n   - Black's queen on e7 is somewhat restricted\n4. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **g8h8**: Gets the king to a safer corner but blocks the rook\n   - **g5h7**: Knight move that defends against potential threats while attacking White's knight\n   - **e7f7**: Queen move that maintains control and keeps pressure\n   - **b2b8**: Rook lift that could create counterplay\n5. **Best Move Analysis**:\n   - g5h7 is very strong because:\n     * It defends against potential Ng4-h6+ threats\n     * It attacks White's knight on g4\n     * It maintains control over f6 square\n     * It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n   - Other moves either don't address the king safety or create new weaknesses\n6. **Potential Continuations**:\n   - After g5h7, if White plays Nxf6, Black can recapture with gxf6 maintaining structure\n   - If White retreats the knight, Black can consider activating the queen or rook\nThe move g5h7 solves multiple problems at once - king safety, piece activity, and maintaining control of key squares.\n```\ng5h7\n```"
