When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, knight vs White's rook, bishop, knight). \n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White has a strong bishop on b3 targeting Black's weak pawn on f7\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n   - White's rook on g3 is very active\n   - Black has a strong bishop on f5 eyeing White's queenside\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - g3g7: Immediate rook sacrifice to expose Black's king\n   - b3e6: Bishop sacrifice to weaken Black's pawn structure\n   - e2f4: Developing knight with tempo on the bishop\n   - d4d5: Pawn break to open the position\n4. Deep analysis of g3g7:\n   - g3g7 Kxg7\n   - b3e6! fxe6 (forced)\n   - Now White has Qg4+ with a strong attack:\n     - Qg4+ Kf7\n     - Qg6+ Ke7\n     - Qxh6 with ongoing pressure\n5. Other moves don't offer the same immediate attacking potential:\n   - b3e6 can be met with ...fxe6 and Black is okay\n   - e2f4 allows Black to defend with ...Bd7\n   - d4d5 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n6. The rook sacrifice g3g7 is sound because:\n   - Black's king will be exposed\n   - White has follow-up threats with the bishop sacrifice\n   - Black's pieces are poorly coordinated to defend\n   - White's remaining pieces can quickly join the attack\n7. Calculating variations after g3g7 shows White gets sufficient compensation and attacking chances against Black's exposed king.\nThe best move is:\n```\ng3g7\n```"
