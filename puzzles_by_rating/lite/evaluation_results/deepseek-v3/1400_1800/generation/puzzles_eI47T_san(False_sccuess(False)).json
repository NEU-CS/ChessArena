When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen on e8, knight on b6, knight on d2, rook on c1, and king on h1\n2. Black has bishop on b7, rook on f2, knight on f4, pawns on a6, b4, d4, g7, h7\n3. Black's king is on g8 with bishop on f8\n4. White is to move\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n1. h1g1 - King moves away from potential checks, but doesn't improve position\n2. e8c6 - Queen moves to attack b7 bishop while protecting b6 knight\n3. e8e4 - Queen centralizes but could be vulnerable to knight fork\n4. b6d5 - Knight moves to central square, attacking f4 knight\n5. d2e4 - Knight moves to e4, attacking f2 rook and f4 knight\n6. d2f3 - Knight moves to f3, attacking f4 knight and defending h4 pawn\n7. c1c6 - Rook moves to attack b6 pawn and potentially pin bishop\nNow let's analyze the best options:\n- e8c6 looks strong as it attacks the bishop on b7 while maintaining protection of the knight on b6. If bishop moves, we can consider capturing the pawn on a6 next.\n- b6d5 is also interesting as it centralizes the knight and attacks black's knight on f4. However, after ...Nxd5, we'd have to recapture with queen, which might not be optimal.\n- d2e4 is tempting as it attacks both the rook on f2 and knight on f4. However, after ...Nxe4, we'd lose material.\n- c1c6 is solid, creating pressure on the b-file and potentially pinning the bishop if it moves.\nAfter careful consideration, e8c6 seems strongest because:\n1. It maintains all our pieces protected\n2. Attacks the bishop on b7\n3. If bishop moves (say to a8), we can play Qxa6 winning a pawn\n4. If bishop doesn't move, we maintain pressure and can consider other ideas\nThe other moves either don't improve our position as much or risk losing material.\n```\ne8c6\n```"
