When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: King, Queen, Rook, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, 6 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with knight vs bishop)\n2. Positional factors:\n- White's queen on e5 is very active\n- Black's queen is somewhat exposed on d7\n- White has a passed pawn on g4\n- Black has doubled pawns on c-file\n- White's knight on h5 is well placed\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxe4 winning a pawn\n- White could also play Qxd7 trading queens\n- Black needs to maintain activity while being careful about White's threats\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d7e6: Queen moves to defend e4 pawn while keeping pressure\n- c8e8: Rook moves to support queen and control e-file\n- g8h8: King moves to safer corner\n- f3g4: Bishop takes the passed pawn\n5. Evaluation:\n- f3g4 looks tempting but after Bxg4, Nxg4 and White's pawn majority becomes dangerous\n- d7e6 seems solid, defending e4 while keeping queen active\n- c8e8 is also reasonable, preparing to double on e-file\n- King moves are too passive\n6. Best move:\nd7e6 is the most solid choice:\n- Defends e4 pawn\n- Keeps queen active\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n- Prepares potential ...Qf5 to challenge White's queen\nThe alternatives either give up material (f3g4) or are too passive (king moves).\n```\nd7e6\n```"
