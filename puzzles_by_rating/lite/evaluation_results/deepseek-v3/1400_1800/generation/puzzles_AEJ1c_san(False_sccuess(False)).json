When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal (White: Q+R+B vs Black: Q+R)\n2. White's pieces are more active\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed\n4. White's king is advanced but potentially vulnerable\n5. Black has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\nNow let's evaluate the legal moves:\n1. g5h6 (King takes g6 pawn):\n   - Captures a pawn but exposes the king\n   - After ...Kxh6, White has Qh4+ but then Black can play ...Kg7\n   - Not clearly winning and king becomes too exposed\n2. g5f4 (King retreats to f4):\n   - Safer king position\n   - But doesn't make progress in the position\n   - Black can continue developing threats\n3. b7e7 (Rook to e7):\n   - Very strong move:\n     - Attacks the black queen\n     - Covers the e-file, preventing ...Qe8+\n     - Prepares potential rook lift to e5 or e6\n     - After ...Qd1 (only reasonable queen move), White can play Qe6+ with a strong attack\n     - Or if ...Qxb7, then Qe6+ wins the rook on h1\nThe best move is clearly b7e7, as it:\n- Gains tempo by attacking the queen\n- Improves rook's position\n- Maintains all of White's threats\n- Limits Black's counterplay\nFinal move:\n```\nb7e7\n```"
