When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Knight, Bishop, pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a strong centralized knight on c7.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on c7 is very strong, attacking both rooks (d8 and f8)\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed e5 pawn\n- Black's bishop on c6 is blocked by its own pawn on b6\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Nxd8 or Nxf8, winning material\n- White could also play e6 soon, further opening the position\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8e8 (moving rook away from attack while maintaining control of e-file)\n- f8f7 (defending against Nxf8 while keeping rook active)\n- c6d7 (blocking the knight's attack on d8)\n- g7e8 (knight move that defends d8 rook)\n5. Evaluating options:\n- c6d7 seems passive and blocks the d-file\n- g7e8 is interesting but leaves f8 rook hanging\n- f8f7 is solid but may allow White to play e6\n- d8e8 is most active, keeping both rooks defended and controlling the e-file\n6. After d8e8:\n- If White takes Nxe8, we recapture Rxe8\n- The e-file remains contested\n- Black's pieces remain coordinated\n7. Other moves like f5g4 or g6g5 weaken the kingside unnecessarily.\nBest move is to centralize the rook and maintain control of the e-file while defending against the knight's threats.\n```\nd8e8\n```"
