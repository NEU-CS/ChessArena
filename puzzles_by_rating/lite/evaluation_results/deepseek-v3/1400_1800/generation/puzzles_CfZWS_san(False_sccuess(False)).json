When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black has a rook on h8, king on e8, bishop on e7, queen on d7, knight on c6, bishop on g4\n- White has a queen on a4, knight on f3, pawns on c5, d4, a3, b2, e2, h3, rook on a1 and h1\n- Black has castling rights (kingside)\n- White has a strong centralized queen and active pieces\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen is very active on a4, eyeing the c6 knight and e8 king\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed in the center\n- The g4 bishop is pinned to the king by White's f3 knight\n- Black has potential threats if they can consolidate and activate their rooks\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8/h8f8 - Rook moves to connect rooks and prepare castling\n- e8g8 - Castling to safety\n- e7f6 - Bishop move to defend the knight\n- c6d4 - Knight jump to central outpost\n4. Evaluating the best options:\n- Castling (e8g8) seems premature as White can play Qd1+ with tempo\n- h8g8 looks solid, connecting rooks and keeping castling option\n- e7f6 defends the knight but blocks the f-pawn\n- c6d4 is tempting but after exd4, White gets strong central control\n5. The best move appears to be h8g8 because:\n- It connects the rooks\n- Maintains flexibility (can still castle later)\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n- Prepares potential rook activation along the g-file\n- Keeps options open for the bishop on e7\nOther moves either create weaknesses or don't improve Black's position as much.\n```\nh8g8\n```"
