When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Balance**: \n   - Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, 4 pawns\n   - White has queen, rook, bishop, 5 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal (Black might be slightly better with the extra minor piece)\n2. **King Safety**:\n   - Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n   - White's king is safer on h2 behind pawns\n3. **Key Features**:\n   - Black's rook on e4 is very active\n   - White's queen on e3 is centralized but potentially vulnerable\n   - Black's bishop on d4 is strong, eyeing g1 and h2\n   - White's bishop on b2 is passive\n4. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **e4f3**: Attacking the queen while discovering attack on h2\n   - **d4g1**: Sacrificing bishop to expose white king\n   - **a7e7**: Moving queen to a more active position\n   - **h7g5**: Developing knight with tempo on h4 bishop\n5. **Best Move Analysis**:\n   - e4f3 looks very strong:\n     * Forces white queen to move (Qxf3 loses to Bxh2+)\n     * After Q moves, Bxh2+ is coming with a strong attack\n     * Even if white finds a defense, black gains material or maintains initiative\n6. **Calculating e4f3**:\n   - If 28. Qxf3 Bxh2+ 29. Kxh2 Qxf3 wins queen\n   - If 28. Qd3 Bxh2+ 29. Kxh2 Qh4+ 30. Kg1 Qg3+ wins\n   - If 28. Qc1 Bxh2+ 29. Kxh2 Qh4+ 30. Kg1 Qg3+ wins\n   - White has no good way to defend against this\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - e4f3 is the most forcing and winning move, leading to immediate material gain or mate\n```\ne4f3\n```"
