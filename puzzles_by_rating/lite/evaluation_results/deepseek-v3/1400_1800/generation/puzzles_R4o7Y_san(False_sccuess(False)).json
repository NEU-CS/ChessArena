When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: rook, queen, knight, 5 pawns\n- White has: queen, 2 rooks, knight, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black might be slightly better with queen vs 2 rooks)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has strong pressure on the b-file (Rb1 attacking b7)\n- Black's queen is very active on e6\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxb7 winning a pawn\n- Black's rook on d3 is very active and could create threats\n- Black's e4 pawn is dangerous if it can advance\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6e8: Queen moves to defend the back rank and potentially double with the rook\n- d3d1: Rook invades to the first rank\n- e4e3: Pushing the passed pawn\n- a8a7: Rook moves to defend b7\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e6e8 seems most prudent, defending the back rank against potential back rank mates and keeping the queen active\n- d3d1 is tempting but after Rxe1 Qxe1, White can defend\n- e4e3 is interesting but White has Qxe3\n- a8a7 is too passive\nThe best move is to bring the queen back to defend while maintaining activity. This prevents any back rank issues and keeps the queen centralized.\n```\ne6e8\n```"
