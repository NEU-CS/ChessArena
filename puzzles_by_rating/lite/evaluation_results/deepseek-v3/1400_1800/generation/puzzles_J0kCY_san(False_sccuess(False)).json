When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and pawn structure:\n- White has king + 2 pawns (g2, f2)\n- Black has king + 3 pawns (g6, f5, h5)\n- White's pawn on h4 is blocked by black's h5 pawn\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is on c7, somewhat far from the action\n- White's king is actively placed on g5\n- Black has connected passed pawns on f5 and g6\n- White's pawns are not yet passed\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g5h6: Captures the g6 pawn, but after Kxh6, black's f-pawn becomes dangerous\n- g5g6: Blocks black's g-pawn, but allows black to push f4\n- g5f6: Attacks black's g6 pawn, but black can play Kd6\n- g5f4: Captures the e4 pawn, but allows black's f-pawn to advance\n- g2g3/g2g4: Prepares to create a passed pawn, but slow\n- f2f3/f2f4: Controls key squares, but doesn't immediately threaten\n4. Best move considerations:\nWe need to stop black's pawns while advancing our own. The most active move is g5f6, attacking the g6 pawn and gaining space. After:\n- g5f6 Kd6 (black must defend the g6 pawn)\n- Then we can play f2f4, fixing black's pawns and preparing to create a passed pawn\nThis seems most promising as it:\n- Actively uses the king\n- Stops black's pawn advances\n- Prepares our own pawn majority\nOther moves either allow black counterplay or are too passive.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5f6\n```"
