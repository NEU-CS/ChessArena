When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Evaluation**: \n   - Black has a rook, bishop and queen vs White's rook, knight and queen. Material is roughly equal.\n   - Black has more active pieces and better coordination.\n2. **Key Features**:\n   - White's king is somewhat exposed on g1.\n   - Black's queen on d3 is very active, eyeing multiple squares near White's king.\n   - Black's rook on e6 is well placed, controlling the e-file.\n   - Black's bishop on d5 is strong, pointing at White's kingside.\n3. **Threats and Opportunities**:\n   - The most dangerous immediate threat is the potential discovered attack with the bishop on d5 if the rook moves.\n   - The queen on d3 could deliver mate threats if combined with other pieces.\n4. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **e6e8**: Doubling rooks on the e-file, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n   - **d3f5**: Queen moves to attack the knight, but this seems too passive.\n   - **d5f3**: Bishop sacrifice to open up White's king. Let's calculate this:\n     - If dxf3, then Qxf3 with threats of Qg2# or Qh1#.\n     - White would have to respond carefully, but it leads to a forced mate.\n   - **d3e2**: Direct queen move threatening mate on g2, but White can defend with Qf2.\n5. **Best Move**:\n   - **d5f3** is the most forcing and decisive move. After:\n     - dxf3 Qxf3\n     - Now Black has multiple threats including Qg2# or Qh1#\n     - White has no good defense against both threats\nThe bishop sacrifice opens up White's king position decisively and leads to a forced mate. Other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate.\n```\nd5f3\n```"
