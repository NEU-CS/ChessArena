When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (a1), Rook (g1), Bishop (h5), Knight (d2), Queen (e2), pawns (a3,b2,d3,f2)\n- Black has: Rook (a8), Queen (f6), Bishop (c5), Bishop (h3), Knight (d4), pawns (a7,b7,c7,d6,e5,h6)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed (f8) with no pawn cover\n- White's bishop on h5 is very strong, eyeing f7\n- Black has a knight on d4 which is well-placed\n- White's rooks are not yet connected\n- Black's bishop on h3 is pinning f1 rook to the king\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5f7: Bishop sacrifice to open the king\n- g1g8: Rook lift to attack the exposed king\n- d2e4: Challenging the strong d4 knight\n- e2e5: Pinning the f6 queen to the king\n4. Deep analysis:\n- h5f7 looks tempting: f7xf7, then Qxf7+ Kg8, but after ...Qxf7 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- g1g8 is interesting: after ...Kxg8, h5f7+ Kh8, but unclear follow-up\n- e2e5 is strong: pins queen to king, threatens Qxf6, and if ...Qxe5, dxe5 opens d-file for rooks\n- d2e4 is solid: removes the strong knight, but less dynamic\n5. Best move:\ne2e5 creates multiple threats (Qxf6, opening lines to the king) while maintaining material balance. After 20.e5 Qxe5 21.dxe5, White gets open files for the rooks and Black's king remains exposed.\nThe move e2e5 is the most forcing and creates the most problems for Black while maintaining White's initiative.\n```\ne2e5\n```"
