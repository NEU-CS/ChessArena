When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, knight vs Black's queen, rook, 2 bishops, knight. Material is roughly equal (Black has slight edge with two bishops).\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on a8\n- Black's king is exposed with weak pawns around it\n- Black has a strong knight on a5 eyeing b3 and c4 squares\n- White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a8b7: Queen takes pawn with check, forcing king to move\n- c1h6: Bishop sacrifice to open up Black's king\n- d4e5: Pawn push attacking f6 pawn\n- b1a3: Developing move, but seems slow\n4. Let's analyze a8b7+:\n- After Kxb7, White can play c1h6 threatening mate on g7\n- Black would have to give up material to prevent mate\n- This leads to a very dangerous attack\n5. c1h6 is also interesting:\n- gxh6 Qxh6 threatens mate on g7\n- Black would have to play f5 or something to defend\n- But Black has Qd7 to defend\n6. d4e5 looks tempting but after fxe5, Black's pieces become more active\n7. b1a3 is too passive and doesn't create threats\nAfter careful consideration, a8b7+ seems the most forcing and dangerous move, leading to a strong attack against Black's exposed king. The immediate check forces Black's king into the open where White can follow up with more threats.\nHere's the move:\n```\na8b7\n```"
