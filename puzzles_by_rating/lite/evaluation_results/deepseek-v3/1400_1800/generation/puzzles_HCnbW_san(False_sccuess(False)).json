When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Bishop, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White may be slightly better due to active pieces)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on e5 is very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- Black's queen on d7 is tied to defending the bishop on e6\n- White's bishop on g3 is pointing at Black's kingside\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) e5e6 - attacking the bishop, but after Qxe6 Rxe6 Bxe6, White loses the exchange\nb) e5h5 - threatening mate on h7, but Black can defend with g6\nc) f3h5 - also threatening mate on h7, but Black can defend with g6\nd) f3f7 - sacrifical but looks promising\ne) b3c5 - developing the knight with tempo\n4. Deep analysis of f3f7:\n- f3f7 Qxf7 Rxf7 Kxf7 Qf3+ Ke8 Qf8#\nThis leads to forced mate! Let's verify:\n- After f3f7, Black must take with Qxf7 (other moves lose immediately)\n- Then Rxf7 Kxf7 (only move)\n- Qf3+ Ke8 (only move)\n- Qf8 is mate (Black's bishop on e6 is pinned by White's bishop on g3)\n5. Other moves don't lead to immediate decisive advantages like this forced mate sequence.\nTherefore, the best move is the queen sacrifice leading to forced mate:\n```\nf3f7\n```"
