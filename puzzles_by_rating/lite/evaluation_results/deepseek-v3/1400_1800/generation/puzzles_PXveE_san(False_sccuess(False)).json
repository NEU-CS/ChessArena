When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black is in a difficult spot with White having strong pressure\n- White has a bishop on h7 that's very dangerous (pinning the f8 rook to the king)\n- Black's king is exposed with weak pawn cover\n- White has threats like Qxg7# or Bxg7+ winning material\n2. Key observations:\n- The immediate threat is Qxg7# (queen takes g7 pawn is checkmate)\n- The bishop on h7 is defended by the pawn on g2\n- Black's queen is on c5, which could be used to defend\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) f8g8 - unpinning the rook but allows Qxg7#\nb) c5g5 - queen blocks the bishop's diagonal to g7\nc) c5e7 - queen moves to defend g7 square\nd) f7f6 - pawn blocks the bishop's diagonal\n4. Evaluating options:\n- f8g8 is bad as it allows mate in 1\n- c5g5 looks interesting but after Qxg5, Black loses the queen\n- f7f6 seems plausible but after exf6, the position remains dangerous\n- c5e7 is the best as it defends g7 and maintains material balance\n5. After c5e7:\n- If Qxg7+, Qxg7 and Black survives\n- The queen is now defending critical squares\n- Black can try to reorganize pieces\n6. Other moves like rook moves don't address the immediate threat.\nConclusion: c5e7 is the only move that prevents immediate catastrophe while keeping material balanced.\n```\nc5e7\n```"
