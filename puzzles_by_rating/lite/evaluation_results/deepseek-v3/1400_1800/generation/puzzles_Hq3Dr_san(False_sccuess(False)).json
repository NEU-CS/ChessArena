When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, 4 pawns vs Black's queen, rook, 3 pawns\n- White is up a pawn, but more importantly has a very active queen and rook\n2. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on b6\n- White's king is relatively safe on g1\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on d6 is attacking White's rook on e8\n- Black's rook on a2 is threatening White's pawn on b2\n- White has multiple ways to maintain pressure\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qg7h6: Threatening mate on b6 (Qxb6#)\n- Re8e6: Pinning the black queen to the king\n- Qg7f6: Also threatening mate on b6\n- Pawn moves to defend b2\n5. Best move analysis:\n- Qg7h6 seems most forcing:\n  - If Qxh6, then Re8e6+ wins the queen (pin)\n  - If Black doesn't take, Qxb6# is mate\n  - Black has no good way to defend against both threats\n6. Other options:\n- Re8e6 is good but allows Black counterplay with Qd6xa3\n- Defending b2 with b2b3 is too passive\n- Qg7f6 is similar to h6 but less direct\nConclusion: Qg7h6 creates an immediate mating threat that Black cannot adequately defend against while maintaining material equality.\n```\ng7h6\n```"
