When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, knight, bishop, rook, 3 pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, bishop, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White may be slightly better due to more active pieces)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on f6, eyeing h8 and controlling important squares\n- White's knight on g5 is threatening to jump into e6 or f7\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n- Black's bishop on b4 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White has pressure along the f-file\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Ne6 or Nf7+, both dangerous\n- White's queen could potentially create mating threats with Qh8+\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b4e7 - trades bishop for knight, but leaves Black's king more exposed\n- f8e8 - connects rooks but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c8d7 - develops queen to a safer square\n- h7h6 - challenges the knight but could weaken the kingside\n5. Best defensive ideas:\n- Need to reduce White's attacking potential\n- Should consider trading pieces to relieve pressure\n- Need to safeguard the king\nAfter careful consideration, b4e7 seems the most principled move:\n- It trades off White's dangerous knight\n- Removes a key attacking piece\n- Even though it's a bishop for knight trade, it's justified by the position\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses\nThe move also prevents White from playing Ne6 with strong pressure, and after the trade, Black can think about consolidating with moves like Qd7 or Re8.\nHere's the move:\n```\nb4e7\n```"
