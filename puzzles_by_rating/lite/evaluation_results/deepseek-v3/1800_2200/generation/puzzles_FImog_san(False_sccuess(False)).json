When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully and determine the best move for White.\nKey observations about the position:\n1. White has a strong bishop pair (c4 and h6) targeting Black's kingside\n2. Black's knight on h5 is somewhat loose and could be a target\n3. White's queen on g3 is very active, eyeing both g7 and e5\n4. Black's king is still in the center (f8) though rooks are connected\n5. White has pressure along the d-file with the rook on d1\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Bxh5 - captures the knight but gives up the strong bishop pair\n2. Qg7 - threatens mate but can be defended by Qxg7\n3. Bf7+ - discovered attack on the queen\n4. Bd5 - centralizing the bishop with threats\nLet me evaluate Bf7+ (c4f7):\n- After 1. Bf7+ Kxf7 (forced, as Qxf7 loses the queen to Qxg7)\n- Then 2. Qxg7+ Ke8 3. Qxh8 winning the exchange (rook for bishop)\n- But Black gets some compensation with active pieces\nNow let's look at Qg7 (g3g7):\n- Black must play Qxg7 (otherwise mate)\n- Then Bxg7 and we've traded queens, reducing attacking potential\n- Not the most ambitious move\nBd5 (c4d5) looks interesting:\n- Threatens to win the e5 pawn (since d5 is protected by the knight)\n- Also eyes the f7 square for future tactics\n- Black would likely have to defend with ...f6, weakening their structure\nAfter careful consideration, Bf7+ (c4f7) seems the most forcing and promising:\n1. It wins material (rook for bishop)\n2. It opens the position where White's pieces are better coordinated\n3. Black's king remains exposed after the sequence\nThe line: 1. Bf7+ Kxf7 2. Qxg7+ Ke8 3. Qxh8 leaves White with a clear advantage.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc4f7\n```"
