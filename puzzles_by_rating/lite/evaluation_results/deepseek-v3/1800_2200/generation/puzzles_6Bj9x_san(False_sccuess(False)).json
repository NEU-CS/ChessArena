When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance and piece placement:\n- White has: King on e1, Rooks on g7 and g3, Bishop on d1, pawns on e3, e4, g2, h4\n- Black has: King on h6, Rooks on a1 and c7, Bishop on f7, pawns on a6, d6, e5, h5\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- White has doubled rooks on the g-file, which could be very powerful\n- Black's rook on a1 is undefended\n- White's bishop is blocked by its own pawn on e3\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7g8: Doubling rooks on the g-file, threatening to penetrate\n- g3h3: Attacking the undefended rook on a1\n- e1f2: Moving the king to safety while opening the bishop's diagonal\n4. Evaluating g3h3:\n- Immediate threat to win the rook on a1\n- Black can defend with Rc7-c1, but then White can play Rh3xh5+ winning a pawn\n- After Kxh5, White has Rg7xh7+ with a strong attack\n5. Evaluating g7g8:\n- Doubles rooks but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Black can defend with Rc7-c1 or other moves\n- Less forcing than g3h3\n6. Evaluating e1f2:\n- King safety is good, but misses the chance to win material\n7. Best move is g3h3 because:\n- It wins material immediately (the rook on a1)\n- Creates threats against Black's king\n- Is the most forcing and concrete move\n- Even if Black finds some defense, White remains clearly better\nThe move g3h3 is clearly superior to other options as it wins material while maintaining the initiative.\n```\ng3h3\n```"
