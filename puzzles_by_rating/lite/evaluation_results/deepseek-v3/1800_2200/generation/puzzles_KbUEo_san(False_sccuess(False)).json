When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let's break down the position:\nMaterial:\n- White has: King on f6, pawns on a4, f4, g2\n- Black has: King on d7, pawn on c7, a7, h4\nKey observations:\n1. White's king is very active (f6) while Black's king is somewhat restricted.\n2. Both sides have passed pawns (White's a-pawn, Black's h-pawn).\n3. White's f-pawn is advanced and could become dangerous.\n4. Black's c-pawn is currently blocked by White's king.\nNow let's evaluate the candidate moves:\n1. **d7e8/d7d8/d7c8**: Moving the king away from the center seems passive and allows White's king to dominate.\n2. **d7d6**: Centralizing the king is generally good, but here it allows White to play Kf6-e5, gaining more space.\n3. **d7c6**: This looks interesting as it prepares to push the c-pawn and also defends the a-pawn.\n4. **c7c6**: This doesn't achieve much and just wastes a tempo.\n5. **a7a6**: This doesn't help Black's position.\n6. **h4h3**: Pushing the passed h-pawn seems logical, but after g2xh3, White's king can stop it while Black's king is too far.\n7. **c7c5**: This is tempting as it creates a passed pawn, but after Kf6-e5, White's king can stop both pawns.\nThe best move appears to be **d7c6** because:\n- It centralizes the king\n- Prepares to push the c-pawn (c6-c5 next)\n- Defends the a7 pawn\n- Keeps options open to go after White's pawns if needed\nAfter d7c6, possible continuation might be:\n1... Kc6\n2. Ke5 c5\n3. Kd5 (stopping the c-pawn)\nAnd Black can then try to create counterplay with the h-pawn.\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White too much activity.\n```\nd7c6\n```"
