When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (knight vs 2 pawns), but pawns are advanced\n2. Black's pawns are connected and can potentially promote\n3. Black's king is very active near the pawns\n4. White needs to either stop the pawns or create counterplay\nLooking at the legal moves:\nKnight moves:\n- e4f6: attacks g5 pawn but allows f5-f4\n- e4d6: not immediately useful\n- e4g5: captures pawn but loses knight to f4xg5\n- e4c5: not threatening\n- e4g3: interesting, threatens fork on e2\n- e4c3: similar idea\n- e4f2: threatens fork on d3\n- e4d2: less effective\nKing moves:\n- d4d5: centralizes king, blocks pawn advance\n- d4c5: similar but less central\n- d4c4/d3/c3: moving away from pawns\nBest candidate moves:\n1. e4g3 - threatens Ne2+ fork\n   - If Kxg3, Kd5 stops pawns\n   - If K moves elsewhere, Ne2+ wins pawn\n2. d4d5 - directly blocks pawns\n   - After d5, black can push f4 but white can attack\nAfter careful consideration, e4g3 seems strongest as it creates immediate threats while also preparing to stop the pawns after possible exchanges.\nLet me verify:\nIf 1. e4g3 f4xg3\n2. Kd5 g4\n3. Ke5 g3\n4. Kf6 g2\n5. Kxg5 g1=Q\n6. Kf6 and white can try to stop the queen\nAlternatively if black doesn't take:\n1. e4g3 Ke4\n2. Ne2+ wins f5 pawn\nTherefore, e4g3 creates the most problems for black.\nFinal move:\n```\ne4g3\n```"
