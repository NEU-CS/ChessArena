When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black is playing and the board is complex with both sides having active pieces\n- White has a bishop on h6 pinning the knight on g8 to the king\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous\n- White has more space and better piece coordination\n2. Key observations:\n- The pin on g8 is very dangerous - if White can maintain it, they may launch a strong attack\n- Black needs to address this pin immediately\n- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated (queen on d7, bishop on b6)\n- White has potential threats like Bxf5 or Qh4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h8f7 - unpinning by moving the rook\nb) g8f7 - moving the knight to break the pin\nc) d7f6 - queen move attacking the bishop\nd) f5f4 - pawn push to gain space\n4. Evaluating the candidates:\na) h8f7 - looks artificial, rook doesn't have good prospects there\nb) g8f7 - breaks the pin but leaves the knight on a passive square\nc) d7f6 - best option: attacks the bishop while developing the queen\n   - After Qf6, if Bxf6 then gxf6 and Black's king gets some air\n   - White likely won't take, but will have to move the bishop\nd) f5f4 - too loosening, gives White more attacking chances\n5. Other moves like pawn pushes or minor piece moves don't address the immediate pin problem.\n6. After Qf6, possible continuation:\n- White likely moves the bishop (Bg5 or Be3)\n- Black can then consider castling or developing other pieces\n- The pin is broken and Black's position becomes more playable\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd7f6\n```"
