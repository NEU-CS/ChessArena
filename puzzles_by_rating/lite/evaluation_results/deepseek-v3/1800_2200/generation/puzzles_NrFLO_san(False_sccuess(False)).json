If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and position:\n- Black has a king on d7 and bishop on g7\n- White has a king on f5, pawn on d6, pawn on c5, and pawn on g6\n- It's Black's move (as indicated by \"b\" in FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n- White has three connected passed pawns that are very dangerous\n- Black's bishop is currently blocking the g-pawn\n- White's king is very active and can support the pawns\n- Black's king is somewhat restricted\n3. Immediate threats:\n- If White gets to play, they can push d7 (with king support) or g7, both very dangerous\n- Black needs to stop these pawns immediately\n4. Evaluating candidate moves:\n- Bishop moves: Most bishop moves would allow White to push pawns. For example:\n  - g7h6 allows g6g7\n  - g7f6 allows d6d7\n  - g7e5 allows d6d7\n- King moves:\n  - d7e8 is passive and allows d6d7\n  - d7d8 is also passive\n  - d7c8 is better as it gets closer to the pawns\n  - d7c6 is interesting as it blocks the c-pawn and threatens to capture it\n5. Best move analysis:\n- d7c6 is the most active move:\n  - It blocks the c5 pawn\n  - Prepares to capture it next move (Kxc5)\n  - After Kxc5, Black can use the bishop to stop the other pawns\n  - The bishop can then move to h6 to stop the g-pawn\n  - This seems like the only way to stop all the pawns\n6. Other moves would allow White to queen a pawn too quickly. For example:\n- If g7h6 (to stop g-pawn), then d6d7 and White queens\n- If g7f6 (to stop d-pawn), then g6g7 and White queens\nTherefore, the only move that stops all immediate threats and gives Black chances to hold is d7c6.\n```\nd7c6\n```"
