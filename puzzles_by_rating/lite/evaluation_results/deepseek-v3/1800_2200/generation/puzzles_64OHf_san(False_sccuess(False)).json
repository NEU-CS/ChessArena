When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- White has a bishop on c4, knight on e4, queen on g3, rooks on a1 and f1, king on g1\n- Black has a queen on f8, bishop on d7, pawns on a7, b7, c6, e6, g7, h6, king on h8\n- White's pieces are very active, especially the bishop on c4 and knight on e4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns on g7 and h6\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on f8 is undefended\n- White's knight on e4 is very strong, attacking multiple squares\n- The bishop on c4 is pinning the pawn on e6 to the king\n- White has potential for a mating attack\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f6: Knight fork attacking queen and g7 pawn\n- c4e6: Bishop sacrifice to open the position\n- g3g7: Queen sacrifice\n- e4d6: Knight fork attacking bishop and f7 square\n4. Analyzing e4f6:\n- After e4f6, if gxf6 then Qg7# (mate)\n- If Qxf6, then Bxe6+ wins the queen\n- Black has no good way to avoid material loss\n5. Other moves:\n- c4e6 is tempting but after dxe6, Nf6+ K moves, Qg7 is not mate yet\n- g3g7 is flashy but after Qxg7, Nxg7 Kxg7 is just equal\n- e4d6 is good but not as forcing as f6\n6. Conclusion:\ne4f6 is the most forcing and decisive move, leading to either immediate mate or winning material. It's the best move in this position.\n```\ne4f6\n```"
