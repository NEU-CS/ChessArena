When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on e6 that's very dangerous.\n- Black's rook is active on a3, but White's rook is more active on f8.\n- Black's king is stuck on c7, vulnerable to checks.\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6e7: Advancing the passed pawn immediately. But after ...Kd7, the pawn is blockaded.\n- f8c8: Rook check to force the black king away from defending the pawns.\n- b4b5: Pushing the b-pawn to create another passed pawn.\n4. Calculating f8c8+:\n- f8c8+ Kd7 (only legal move)\n- Now e6e7 is possible, but Black can play ...Ra1 threatening mate on g1\n- White would need to play Rc7+ to stop the mate, but it's messy\n5. Calculating b4b5:\n- b4b5 creates a passed pawn, but Black can respond with ...Ra4 attacking it\n- After b5xc6 bxc6, White's advantage is reduced\n6. Best move seems to be f8c8+:\n- Forces the black king to d7\n- Then e6e7 creates serious threats\n- Even if Black tries ...Ra1, White has Rc7+ Kd8 e7e8Q+ winning\nThe most forcing and decisive line is to start with the rook check, forcing the black king away from defending the pawns and allowing the e-pawn to advance decisively.\n```\nf8c8\n```"
