When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (d6), Rook (g5), pawns (b3, d4, f4)\n- Black has: Rook (f2), Knight (h4), Knight (g6), King (h6), pawns (a6, b7)\n- Material is roughly equal (White has 2 rooks vs Black's rook + 2 knights)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on d3\n- Black king is somewhat exposed on h6\n- Black has threats with the knight on h4 eyeing f3 and g2 squares\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's rook on f2 is attacking White's f4 pawn\n- Black's knight on h4 could potentially fork king and rook if White isn't careful\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6g6: Capturing the knight and forcing Black to recapture with king (h6xg6), opening h-file\n- g5g6: Also attacking the knight, but less forcing\n- d3e4: Moving king to safer square while attacking h4 knight\n- f4f5: Advancing pawn to create threats against Black's king\n5. Best move analysis:\n- d6g6 is very strong because:\n  a) It forces Black to recapture with king (if 51...Nxg6 52.Rxg6+ wins the knight)\n  b) After 51...Kxg6, White can play 52.Rg1+ with strong attack:\n     - 52...Kh7 53.Rg7+ Kh8 54.Rxh4 winning material\n     - 52...Kh5 53.Rg5+ Kh6 54.Rxh4+ winning the knight\n  c) It removes a defender of Black's king\n  d) It opens the h-file for White's rook\nOther moves don't create such immediate threats or allow Black counterplay. For example:\n- d3e4 allows 51...Nxf4+ winning a pawn\n- g5g6 allows 51...Nxg6 with less pressure\n- f4f5 doesn't address the immediate threats\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd6g6\n```"
