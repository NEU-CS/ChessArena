When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully. Here's the FEN: `8/6RP/8/8/8/3pk1p1/7r/6K1 b - - 1 64`\nThis means:\n- Black to move\n- White has a rook on g7 and a pawn on h7 (which is promoted to a queen? No, it's still a pawn since it's on h7)\n- Black has:\n  - King on e3\n  - Rook on h2\n  - Pawn on g3\n  - Pawn on d3\n- White's king is on g1\nKey observations:\n1. White's h7 pawn is one move away from promotion (h7-h8=Q)\n2. Black's rook on h2 is currently blocking the pawn's promotion path\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n4. White's rook on g7 is very active and could become dangerous if the h-pawn promotes\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n**King moves (e3):**\n- e3f4: moves king towards center but doesn't help stop promotion\n- e3e4: same\n- e3d4: same\n- e3f3: keeps king near pawns but doesn't address promotion\n- e3e2: moves king towards safety but away from action\n- e3d2: same as e3e2\n**Rook moves (h2):**\n- h2h7: captures the pawn immediately - this seems critical\n- h2h6: blocks the pawn but allows h7-h8 next move\n- Other rook moves along the 2nd rank don't help stop promotion\n**Pawn moves:**\n- g3g2: doesn't help with the promotion threat\n- d3d2: same\nThe most critical threat is the h7 pawn promoting. We must stop this immediately. The best way is:\n1. h2h7 - takes the pawn directly. After this:\n   - White can recapture with g7xh7\n   - Then we have a rook vs rook endgame where Black is slightly better due to the extra pawn (g3 and d3 vs none for White)\n   - Our king is active enough to support the pawns\nOther options like h2h6 just delay the promotion by one move but don't solve the problem. Taking the pawn immediately is best.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh2h7\n```"
