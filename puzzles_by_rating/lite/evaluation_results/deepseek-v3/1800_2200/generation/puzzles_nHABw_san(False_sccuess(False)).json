When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully and determine the best move for White.\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a strong knight on e5 that's very active and well-placed.\n2. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns on f7, g7, h6.\n3. White has a queen on b3 and bishop on d3 pointing towards Black's kingside.\n4. White has rooks on c1 and e1 with potential to open files.\n5. Black has doubled rooks on the c-file but they're not immediately threatening.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5f7 - Knight sacrifice to expose the king\n2. d3h7 - Bishop sacrifice\n3. b3b4 - Queen move to maintain pressure\n4. e1e4 - Rook lift to potentially join the attack\nLet's analyze e5f7 in detail:\n- e5f7+ forces kxf7 (king must take)\n- Then d3h7! is a strong follow-up:\n  - If g6xh7, Qf7+ wins the queen\n  - If king moves, Qf7+ leads to mate\n  - Black's best is Qxh7 but then Qxb6 wins material\nOther moves:\n- d3h7 immediately is less forcing as Black can play g6\n- b3b4 maintains pressure but doesn't create immediate threats\n- e1e4 is interesting but not as forcing\nThe knight sacrifice e5f7 is very strong here as it:\n1) Immediately exposes Black's king\n2) Opens lines for White's pieces\n3) Leads to forced winning lines\n4) Black has no good way to defend against the coming attack\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5f7\n```"
