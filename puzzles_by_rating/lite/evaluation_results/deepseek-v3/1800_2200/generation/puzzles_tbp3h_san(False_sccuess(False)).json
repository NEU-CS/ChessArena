When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (rook, bishop, knight, pawns). White has a slight space advantage.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on e4 and bishop on f4, both well-placed.\n- Black has a bishop pair but they're not optimally placed (e6 bishop blocked by pawns).\n- White has a passed pawn on b4, but it's currently blockaded by Black's pawn on b6.\n- White's king is slightly exposed but not in immediate danger.\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f6: Knight fork attacking queen and rook. But after ...Qxf6, White doesn't gain material.\n- f4h6: Threatening to win the bishop pair by exchanging on g7. But Black can defend with ...Bh8.\n- d1d8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, putting pressure on Black's position.\n- h4h5: Pawn push to open the h-file for the rook.\n- g4g5: Pawn push to gain space and potentially open files.\n4. Best move analysis:\n- d1d8 is very strong because:\n  - It brings the rook to an active position\n  - Threatens to double rooks on the d-file\n  - Puts pressure on Black's back rank\n  - Prepares potential rook infiltration to d7 or d6\n  - Black has no immediate way to challenge this rook\n  - Maintains all of White's other positional advantages\nOther moves like e4f6 or f4h6 are tempting but don't achieve as much. The rook lift is the most principled move, improving White's worst-placed piece.\nHere's the move:\n```\nd1d8\n```"
