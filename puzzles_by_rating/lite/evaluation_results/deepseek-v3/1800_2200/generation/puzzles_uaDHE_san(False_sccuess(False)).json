When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (both sides have a king and some pawns)\n2. Black's king is at d7, White's at e5\n3. Black has a knight at f4, White has pawns at a4, b2, d6, e7, f7\n4. Black has pawns at a6, b7, g6, h4\n5. White's e7 pawn is protected by the f7 pawn and could promote soon\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. King moves: d7e8, d7c8, d7c6\n   - e8 looks dangerous as it brings the king closer to White's pawns\n   - c6 might be better to centralize the king\n2. Knight moves: Many options\n   - f4e6 looks interesting to attack the d6 pawn\n   - f4d5 blocks the white king\n   - f4h5 threatens h4 pawn but seems less useful\n3. Pawn moves:\n   - b7b5 could be good to create passed pawn\n   - g6g5 pushes the pawn but might weaken structure\n   - h4h3 pushes the h-pawn but doesn't seem urgent\nLet's evaluate some key lines:\n- If d7c6: White can play e7e8=Q, but then c6xd6 wins the d6 pawn\n- If f4e6: Attacks d6 pawn, but after Kxe6, b7b5 looks good for Black\n- If b7b5: Creates a passed pawn, but White can push e7e8=Q immediately\nThe most forcing line seems to be f4e6:\n1. ... f4e6\n2. Kxe6 (forced, as d6 is hanging)\nNow Black can play b7b5 with good counterplay on the queenside\nAlternatively, d7c6 is also strong:\n1. ... d7c6\n2. e7e8=Q c6xd6\nAnd Black has good drawing chances with the passed b-pawn\nBetween these two, f4e6 seems more active as it forces the king to take and gains a tempo.\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\nf4e6\n```"
