When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Positional Assessment**:\n   - Black has a solid position with a bishop on d7 and knight on e7\n   - White has a strong bishop on f4 pointing at Black's kingside\n   - Both sides have castled, but Black's king is slightly more exposed\n   - Black has a central pawn majority (d5 and c5 vs White's c3)\n2. **Key Considerations**:\n   - White's rook on e1 is very active\n   - Black needs to complete development and find counterplay\n   - The h8 rook is currently passive and needs activation\n   - The d5 pawn is a potential weakness if not supported\n3. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **h8g8**: Prepares to double rooks on the g-file, but doesn't address immediate concerns\n   - **e8g8 (castling)**: Gets the king to safety but leaves the rook passive\n   - **d7f6**: Develops the bishop actively, attacking e5 square\n   - **d5d4**: Creates central tension, but opens lines for White's pieces\n   - **a8d8**: Centralizes the rook and connects rooks\n4. **Best Choice**:\n   - **d7f6** is the most active move:\n     * Develops the bishop to an active diagonal\n     * Controls the important e5 square\n     * Prepares to potentially trade White's strong bishop\n     * Doesn't create any weaknesses\n     * Maintains flexibility for future plans\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position significantly or create weaknesses. For example, d5d4 would open the position when Black isn't fully developed, while rook moves don't address the piece activity issue.\nThe move d7f6 also prevents White from playing moves like Ne5 in the future, and keeps options open for both kingside and queenside play.\n```\nd7f6\n```"
