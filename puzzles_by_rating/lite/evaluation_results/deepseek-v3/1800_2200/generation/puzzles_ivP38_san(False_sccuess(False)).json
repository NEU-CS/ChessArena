When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, pawns (including a passed pawn on e5 and f7)\n- Black has queen, rook, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal but White has a strong initiative\n2. Key features:\n- White's f7 pawn is one square from promotion and defended by the rook on g5\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White's queen on b3 has multiple attacking options\n- Black's queen on c8 is somewhat passive\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) g5g7 - immediate rook sacrifice to open up Black's king\nb) b3b7 - queen move threatening mate on f7\nc) e5e6 - advancing the passed pawn\nd) b3d5 - centralizing the queen\n4. Analysis of g5g7:\n- g5g7 Kxg7 (forced)\n- f7f8Q+ Kg6\n- Now White has queen and pawn vs queen and rook, but Black's king is very exposed\n- Follow up with Qf6+ or Qg8+ with strong threats\n- This seems very promising as it opens Black's king\n5. Analysis of b3b7:\n- Threatens Qf7#\n- Black can defend with Qe8 or Qd7\n- Doesn't lead to immediate decisive advantage\n6. Analysis of e5e6:\n- Solid but slow, gives Black time to organize defense\n7. Analysis of b3d5:\n- Centralizes queen but doesn't create immediate threats\nThe rook sacrifice g5g7 seems most promising as it:\n- Forces the king into the open\n- Leads to immediate threats against the exposed king\n- Creates mating nets with the queen\n- Even if Black declines with Kf8, White can play Qf7+ winning\nOther moves don't create such immediate threats. The sacrifice is sound because White gets a decisive attack after the king is exposed.\n```\ng5g7\n```"
