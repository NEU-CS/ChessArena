When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White's rook is very active on b6, controlling the 6th rank\n2. Black's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n3. White's passed c-pawn is dangerous but currently blocked by black's e-pawn\n4. Black has multiple pawns on the kingside that could become dangerous\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. King moves: d7e7 looks safest, keeping the king near the center\n2. Knight moves: b7d6 looks interesting, attacking the rook\n3. Pawn moves: e6e5 could be considered to free the knight\n4. Pawn moves: g4g3 or h4h3 to advance the pawns\nLet's evaluate:\n- b7d6 seems tempting as it attacks the rook, but after Rxd6 Kxd6, white's c-pawn becomes unstoppable\n- e6e5 would open up the position but after Kxe5, black's position collapses\n- g4g3 looks interesting, creating passed pawns\n- d7e7 is solid, keeping the king safe\nThe best move appears to be d7e7, keeping the king safe and maintaining the blockade on e6. Other moves either lose material or allow white's passed pawn to advance.\nAfter d7e7, possible continuation:\n- White might try to bring the king closer (Ke4d4)\n- Black can then consider advancing pawns on the kingside\nThis seems like the most resilient option that doesn't give white any immediate advantages.\n```\nd7e7\n```"
