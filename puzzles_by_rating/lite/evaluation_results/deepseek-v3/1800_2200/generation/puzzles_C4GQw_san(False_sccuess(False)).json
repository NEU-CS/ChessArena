When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- White has a bishop pair (light-squared bishop on c1 and dark-squared on d2)\n- Black has a strong pawn center with pawns on d5 and e5\n- Black's knight on c6 is well placed, eyeing d4\n- White's knight on f3 is under pressure from Black's pawn on e5\n- White's queen on e2 is active but could be exposed\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White has castling rights (KQ)\n- Black has potential threats like ...Qa5 or ...Bg4\n- White's pawn on d4 is under pressure from Black's pawn on b5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g5: Developing the knight aggressively, attacking f7\n- e2b5: Queen move pinning the c6 knight\n- e5e6: Pawn push to open the position\n- h1g1: Preparing to castle\n- c1d2: Developing the bishop and protecting the knight\n4. Evaluating the best options:\n- f3g5 looks tempting as it develops the knight with tempo (threatening f7), but after ...h6 the knight might have to retreat\n- e2b5 pins the knight but allows ...a6 forcing the queen to move again\n- e5e6 is interesting to open the position against Black's uncastled king\n- h1g1 is solid, preparing to castle, but doesn't address the immediate position\n- c1d2 is too passive\n5. Best choice:\ne5e6 is the most dynamic move:\n- Opens the position against Black's king\n- Creates immediate threats on the f7 square\n- Gains space in the center\n- After ...fxe6, White can follow up with Qh5+ or Ng5 with strong attacking chances\nThe move e5e6 creates immediate complications that Black must deal with, while White's king is still safe enough to handle any counterplay.\n```\ne5e6\n```"
