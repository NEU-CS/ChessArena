When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black has a king on g8, rooks on e8 and d8, queen on d6, knight on c6, and pawns on a7, b7, f7, g7, h7\n- White has a king on g1, rook on d1 and f1, queen on d2, knight on d4, and pawns on a2, b2, c3, f2, g2\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with white's pieces active in the center\n- White's knight on d4 is well-placed, attacking c6 and potentially eyeing f5\n2. Key observations:\n- White has pressure on the d-file with queen and rook\n- Black's queen on d6 is somewhat awkward as it blocks the d-file\n- Black's rooks are not optimally placed (doubled on e8 and d8)\n- White has a slight space advantage\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e7: Gets the queen out of the way of the rooks\n- d6f6: Centralizes the queen and defends the knight\n- e8e7: Moves the rook to a more active file\n- c6e5: Knight maneuver to challenge white's strong knight\n4. Evaluating d6e7:\n- Pros: Unblocks the d-file for rooks, connects rooks\n- Cons: Queen might become passive on e7\n5. Evaluating d6f6:\n- Pros: Active queen position, defends c6 knight\n- Cons: Still blocks the d-file somewhat\n6. Evaluating e8e7:\n- Pros: Activates the rook, connects rooks\n- Cons: Doesn't solve the queen's awkward position\n7. Evaluating c6e5:\n- Pros: Challenges white's strong knight, activates black's knight\n- Cons: White can take with pawn (c3xe5) or knight (d4xe5)\nAfter careful consideration, c6e5 seems the most principled move:\n- It immediately challenges white's strong knight\n- If white takes with pawn (c3xe5), black can recapture with queen (d6xe5), activating the queen\n- If white takes with knight (d4xe5), black can play d6xe5, opening the d-file for rooks\n- In both cases, black's pieces become more active\nThe move also prevents white from playing Nxc6 followed by Qxd6, which would win material.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc6e5\n```"
