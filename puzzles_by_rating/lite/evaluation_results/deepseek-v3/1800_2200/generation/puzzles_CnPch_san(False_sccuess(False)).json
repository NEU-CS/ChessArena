When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White: Queen, Knight, 2 pawns, King\n- Black: Queen, Knight, 2 pawns, King\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. King safety:\n- White king is relatively safe on h3\n- Black king is exposed on g7 with potential threats\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on b1 is threatening mate in 1 (Qh1#)\n- White must address this threat first\n4. Candidate moves to prevent mate:\n- Qg7+ forces the black king to move (only legal move is Kh7)\n- Then we can consider checks or other threats\n5. After Qg7+ Kh7:\n- Qxh6+ wins a pawn and keeps initiative\n- Or Qf7+ maintains pressure\n- Black's position would be very difficult to defend\n6. Other options:\n- Moving the knight doesn't help with the mate threat\n- Moving the pawn or king doesn't address the immediate danger\n- Any other queen move would allow Qh1#\nThe only move that prevents mate while maintaining an advantage is Qg7+. This forces the black king to move and allows White to continue the attack.\n```\ne7g7\n```"
