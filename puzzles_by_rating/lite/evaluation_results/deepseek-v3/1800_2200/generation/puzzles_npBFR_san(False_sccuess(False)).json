When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, rook, knight, queen, pawns (e6, f7, h7)\n- White has: king, queen, rook, pawns (a2, b3, c2, g2, h2)\n- Material is roughly equal (Black has knight vs White's extra pawn)\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on g7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on d8\n- White's king is relatively safe on f6\n- Black's queen is active but needs to be careful about White's threats\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential mating threats with Qg7\n- Black needs to address the immediate danger to the king\n4. Candidate moves:\na) King moves: d8c8 looks safest, getting away from potential checks\nb) Queen moves: e1e5 looks interesting to create counterplay\nc) Knight moves: c5d7 blocks potential queen checks and defends the king\nd) Pawn moves: e6e5 gains space but weakens d6\n5. Analysis:\n- d8c8: Gets the king to relative safety but doesn't address other threats\n- e1e5: Creates counterplay but leaves king exposed\n- c5d7: Solid defensive move, blocks queen checks, and defends king\n- e6e5: Too weakening\n6. Best move:\nc5d7 is the most solid choice. It:\n- Blocks potential queen checks along the d-file\n- Defends the king\n- Maintains the knight's central position\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\nOther moves either leave the king exposed or create new weaknesses. While e1e5 is tempting for counterplay, it's too risky with the king so exposed.\n```\nc5d7\n```"
