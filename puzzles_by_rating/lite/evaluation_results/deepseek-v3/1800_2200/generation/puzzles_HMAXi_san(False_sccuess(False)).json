When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the material balance:\n   - White has a knight on f5 and bishop on f6, both attacking Black's position\n   - Black's king is exposed on f7\n   - White has castling rights while Black doesn't\n2. Key threats:\n   - White's knight on f5 is very strong, attacking g7 and h6\n   - White's bishop on f6 pins the pawn on g6 to the king\n   - White could castle queenside next move\n3. Black's immediate problems:\n   - The king is unsafe on f7\n   - The bishop on c8 is blocked by pawns\n   - The rook on a8 is inactive\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - f7g8 - moves king away from immediate threats\n   - f8g7 - develops bishop and defends g7\n   - d8e7 - connects rooks and defends e5 pawn\n   - c6e7 - blocks the bishop's pin and develops knight\n5. Evaluating the best option:\n   - f7g8 looks passive and allows White to castle with initiative\n   - f8g7 seems logical but White can play Qd3 with strong pressure\n   - d8e7 is solid but doesn't solve the king safety issue\n   - c6e7 is the most active, blocking the bishop's pin and preparing to develop the bishop\n6. After c6e7:\n   - The bishop pin is broken\n   - Black can follow up with Bf5 or Bg7\n   - The knight is more active on e7 than c6\n   - White's attack is slowed down\nThe move c6e7 solves multiple problems at once - it breaks the pin, develops the knight to a better square, and prepares to complete development. Other moves either don't address the immediate threats or are too passive.\n```\nc6e7\n```"
