When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Evaluation**: \n   - White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n   - Black's pawn structure is slightly better with connected central pawns.\n2. **Key Features**:\n   - Black's queen on f7 is very active, eyeing the b3 square and potentially the white king.\n   - White's queen on b2 is well placed, controlling the long diagonal.\n   - Black's knight on e4 is strong but potentially unstable.\n   - White's knight on e2 could be better placed.\n3. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **b2b8**: Looks tempting to win the rook, but after Qxb8 Rxb8, we lose our active queen.\n   - **b2e5**: Attacks the e4 knight while maintaining pressure. Black can defend with Qe6 or Qg7.\n   - **e2f4**: Directly challenges the knight. After exf4, we recapture with pawn, but this opens the position.\n   - **e2g3**: Improves the knight's position, defending the e4 square and preparing to jump to f5.\n   - **e1f1**: Doubling rooks on the e-file, but not immediately impactful.\n4. **Best Move**:\n   - **b2e5** is strong because:\n     - It attacks the knight while maintaining our queen's activity\n     - If Black plays Qe6, we can consider Qxe6 dxe6, leaving us with a small advantage\n     - If Black plays Qg7, we can follow up with e2f4, increasing pressure\n     - It keeps our queen centralized and active\n5. **Why not other moves**:\n   - b2b8 trades queens when we have attacking potential\n   - e2f4 allows exf4 which opens the position when our king is slightly exposed\n   - e2g3 is solid but less active than b2e5\nThe move b2e5 maintains pressure while keeping all our pieces active and coordinated.\n```\nb2e5\n```"
