When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Rook, Queen, minor pieces). Black has doubled rooks on the g-file which could be useful.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8, while White's king is safer on g1. White has pressure along the e-file.\n3. Key features:\n   - White has a rook on a5 attacking the c5 pawn\n   - Black's bishop on g4 is pinned to the queen (if it moves, Qxg4)\n   - White's queen on e4 is very active\n   - Black's queen on e7 is somewhat restricted\n4. Threats:\n   - White could play Qxc5 winning a pawn\n   - White could increase pressure with moves like Re3 or f3\n5. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - d7c8: Protecting the c5 pawn with the queen\n   - g4e6: Bishop retreat while maintaining pressure\n   - g6f6: Doubling rooks on the f-file\n   - f7f6: Creating luft for the king\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d7c8 seems too passive and allows White to maintain initiative\n- g4e6 is interesting but after Qxc5, Black doesn't get enough compensation\n- g6f6 is tempting but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f7f6 creates luft but weakens the e6 square\nThe best move appears to be g4e6, sacrificing the c5 pawn but activating the bishop and maintaining piece activity. After Qxc5, Black can play Rf6 with counterplay against White's king position.\nHere's the move:\n```\ng4e6\n```"
