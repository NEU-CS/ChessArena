When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, knight, pawns vs Black's queen, bishop, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on f5 is very strong, attacking g7 and e7 squares near Black's king\n- Black's queen is on d1, pinning White's bishop on b1\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed e-pawn that could be dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5g7 (knight sac) - very tempting as it opens Black's king\n- g3h4 (queen move) - threatens mate on h7\n- e5e6 (pawn push) - advances passed pawn\n- Other queen moves to maintain pressure\n4. Analyzing f5g7:\n- f5g7 fxg7 (forced)\n- Qh4 threatens Qh7#\n- Black's only defense is Qg4, but then Qxg4 hxg4\n- White gets a strong passed e-pawn and active pieces\n- Even if Black finds other defenses, White maintains strong initiative\n5. Other options:\n- g3h4 is good but Black can defend with Qg4\n- e5e6 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- The knight sacrifice is most forcing and dangerous\n6. Potential lines after f5g7:\n- f5g7 fxg7\n- Qh4 Qg4 (only move to prevent mate)\n- Qxg4 hxg4\n- e6 and White's pawns become very dangerous\n- Black's king remains exposed\nConclusion: The knight sacrifice f5g7 is the most forcing and promising move, leading to a strong attack against Black's exposed king while maintaining material equality after the sequence. It creates immediate threats that Black must respond to precisely.\n```\nf5g7\n```"
