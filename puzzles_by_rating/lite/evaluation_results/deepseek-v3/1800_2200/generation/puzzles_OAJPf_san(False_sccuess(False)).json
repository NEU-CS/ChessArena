When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- White has pawns on a4, d4, f4, g4, h4 and king on e3\n- Black has pawns on a5, c6, f5, g6, h6 and king on d5\n- It's White's turn (as indicated by \"w\" in FEN)\n2. Material count:\n- Both sides have 5 pawns each, equal material\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's king is more active (d5 vs e3)\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has potential passed pawns on a5 and c6\n- The position is closed with many pawns fixed against each other\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e3f3: King moves towards center but doesn't accomplish much\n- e3d3: King moves towards black king, but black can respond with ...Kd5-c4\n- e3f2: King retreats, not helpful\n- e3e2: King retreats, not helpful\n- e3d2: King retreats, not helpful\n- g4f5: Pawn exchange, but after ...g6xf5, black gets open g-file\n- h4h5: Creates a passed h-pawn but allows ...g6-g5 fixing white's pawns\n- g4g5: This seems most promising as it:\n  * Fixes black's f5 pawn\n  * Prepares h4-h5-h6 creating a passed pawn\n  * Limits black's king mobility\n  * Maintains pawn tension\n5. Why g4g5 is best:\n- It creates long-term prospects for creating a passed pawn\n- It restricts black's options\n- Other moves either don't improve white's position or lead to exchanges that help black\n- The move maintains flexibility while improving white's structure\n6. Potential continuation after g4g5:\nBlack might try ...Kd5-c4, but then white can play Kd3 keeping the position balanced\nOr black might play ...h6-h5, but then white can push f4-f5 at the right moment\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\ng4g5\n```"
