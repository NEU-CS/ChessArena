When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (Black has pawns at a4, b5, c5, g6, g7, h5; White has pawns at a3, b2, d3, g5, h4)\n2. Black's king is at d6, White's king is at d3\n3. Both sides have passed pawns (Black's a-pawn, White's b-pawn)\n4. The position is very closed with many pawns fixed against each other\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. King moves: d6e7, d6d7, d6c7, d6e6, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5\n2. Pawn moves: c5c4, b5b4\nEvaluation:\n- The key is to activate the king while restraining White's passed b-pawn\n- Moving the king towards the queenside seems most promising to support our pawns and stop White's b-pawn\n- d6c6 is good as it moves towards the queenside and maintains flexibility\n- d6c7 would be too passive\n- Pawn moves like c5c4 would weaken our structure unnecessarily\n- b5b4 would open lines for White's king\nBest move is d6c6 because:\n1. Centralizes the king more\n2. Prepares to support the c5 pawn\n3. Can later move to b5 to support the b-pawn\n4. Maintains flexibility to go to either side of the board\n5. Doesn't allow White's king any penetration\nOther moves:\n- d6e6 would be less active\n- d6d5 would walk into potential opposition\n- Pawn moves would weaken our structure\n```\nd6c6\n```"
