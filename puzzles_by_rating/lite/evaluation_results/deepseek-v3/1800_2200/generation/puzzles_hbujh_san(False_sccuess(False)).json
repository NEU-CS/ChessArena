When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has Rook, Queen, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has Rook, Queen, Rook, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with extra pawn)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on g1\n- Black king is on f7, also exposed\n- Black has queen on h3 threatening mate on g2\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on h3 threatens Qxg2#\n- Black's rook on f3 is attacking our f2 pawn\n- Our rook on b8 is very active\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Defending against mate: Qg2 is impossible (queen is on b2), so we need to block or move the king\nb) Counterplay with our active rook: b8h8 looks tempting to attack the black king\nc) Knight moves: e3f5 could be interesting to attack the queen\n5. Analysis of key moves:\n- b8h8: Threatens Rh7# next move. Black would have to play Qxh8, but then we take with Rxh8 and have a winning position\n- b2g7: Checks the king, but after Kxg7 we lose our queen\n- e3f5: Attacks the queen, but Qxf5 and we lose a knight for nothing\n- g1h1: Gets out of mate threat but is passive\n6. Best move:\nb8h8 is crushing because:\n- It threatens immediate mate on h7\n- If Qxh8, Rxh8 and we're up a queen for rook\n- Black has no good way to defend against Rh7#\nOther moves either don't address the mate threat or lose material. b8h8 is both defensive (by forcing the queen to deal with the threat) and offensive (creating mating threats).\n```\nb8h8\n```"
