When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is to move (we're playing as Black)\n2. Material is roughly equal (Black has rook + bishop + rook vs White's rook + bishop + pawns)\n3. White has a passed pawn on f6 that could be dangerous\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8\n5. White's rook on h5 is very active\n6. Black has a rook on c7 and another on g4\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. King moves (f8g8, f8e8, f8f7) - generally want to get the king safer\n2. Rook moves - c7 moves or g4 moves\n3. Bishop moves - d3 has several options\n4. Pawn moves - b6b5 or d5d4\nLet's evaluate some key options:\n1. f8g8 - King moves to safer square, but doesn't address immediate threats\n2. c7f7 - Rook moves to attack the f6 pawn, but White can defend with Rh6\n3. g4g2 - Rook checks the king, forcing it to g1, then we can play Rg3 pinning the bishop\n4. d3e4 - Bishop blocks the rook's attack on g4 and eyes the f3 square\nThe most forcing and promising line seems to be g4g2+:\n- g4g2+ Kh2 (only move)\n- Then we can play Rg3, pinning the bishop to the king\n- This creates serious threats like Rg3xh3 next move\n- White would have to find precise defense\nOther options either don't create threats or allow White to push the f-pawn.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng4g2\n```"
