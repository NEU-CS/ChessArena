When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, R, B, Px3\n- Black has: Q, R, R, B, Px4\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with extra pawn but Black's pieces are active)\n2. King safety:\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n- Black's king is safer on g7 but could be vulnerable to checks\n3. Piece activity:\n- Black's queen and rooks are very active\n- White's queen on b8 is dangerous\n- Black has a strong bishop on b7 eyeing White's king\n4. Threats:\n- White threatens Qb8xb6 winning a pawn\n- Black can create threats against White's king\nLooking at candidate moves:\na) f6h6 - Queen checks the king, but after Kh1, Black doesn't have immediate follow-up\nb) b7g2 - Bishop sacrifice, but after Kxg2 Qh3+ Kg1 Qxh3, White can defend\nc) e3e1 - Rook to first rank, defensive but passive\nd) f6f2 - Queen sacrifice, but after Rxf2 Rxf2, unclear\ne) b7f3 - Bishop move attacking the rook and creating discovered attack on the king\nThe most promising seems to be b7f3:\n- Attacks the rook on d1\n- Creates discovered attack on the king (queen would check if not for the rook)\n- If White takes the bishop with Rxf3, then Qxf3+ and Black wins the rook back with advantage\n- If White moves the rook, Black can follow up with strong threats\nOther moves either don't create enough threats or allow White to consolidate. b7f3 creates immediate tactical problems for White.\n```\nb7f3\n```"
