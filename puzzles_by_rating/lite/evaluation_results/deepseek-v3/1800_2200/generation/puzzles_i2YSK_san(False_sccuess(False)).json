When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, knight, 4 pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, 5 pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h6 is very active, threatening Black's king\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black has a knight on b4 attacking d3 pawn\n- White has rooks on h3 and c1 that can potentially double on the h-file\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h8: Queen trade, but this would relieve pressure\n- h6f8: Checks king, forcing it to e7 where we can follow up with d5e6+\n- h6g7: Another check, but less forcing\n- d5e6: Pawn sacrifice to open lines\n- c3e4: Developing knight with tempo\n4. Best move analysis:\n- h6f8+ is very strong because:\n  a) Forces king to e7 (only legal move)\n  b) Then we can play d5e6+ forking king and queen\n  c) After king moves, we can capture the queen with exf8=Q+\n  d) This wins material decisively\n5. Other options:\n- h6h8 trades queens but loses initiative\n- h6g7 allows Ke8 and we lose momentum\n- d5e6 immediately is good but not as forcing\n6. Conclusion:\nThe most forcing and winning line is h6f8+ followed by d5e6+, winning the queen.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh6f8\n```"
