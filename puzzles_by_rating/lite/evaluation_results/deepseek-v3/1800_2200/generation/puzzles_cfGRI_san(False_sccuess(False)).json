Material count:\n- White has: Rook (b7), Rook (c7), Knight (c6), Pawns (a5, f3, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (a2), Rook (e8), Knight (f5), Pawns (g6, h7)\n- Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with extra pawn)\n2. Key features:\n- White has two active rooks on the 7th rank\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- Black has a rook on a2 threatening White's pawns\n- White's knight is well-placed on c6\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7e7: attacking the rook on e8 and potentially doubling rooks\n- c6e7: fork attacking rook and king\n- b7b2: capturing the pawn on a2 and threatening the rook\n- a5a6: advancing the passed pawn\n4. Analysis of best options:\n- c6e7+ is very strong:\n  - Forces the king to move (Kh8 or Kf8)\n  - After Kh8, White can play c7e7 pinning the rook to the king\n  - After Kf8, White can play b7b7+ winning the rook\n- Other moves are less forcing:\n  - c7e7 allows Black to defend with Re7\n  - b7b2 allows Black counterplay with Ra1+\n5. Conclusion:\nThe knight fork on e7 is the most forcing and winning move, as it immediately wins material while maintaining the initiative.\n```\nc6e7\n```"

Best move analysis:\n- e7g8 looks tempting but after f8g8, white doesn't gain material\n- c7c8 is strong because after f8c8, b7b8 wins the rook\n- a5a6 is also good but gives black counterplay with a2h2\n- b7b8 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\nThe most forcing and strongest move is c7c8, creating a pin that will win material:\n1. c7c8 f8c8 (forced)\n2. b7b8 and white wins the rook\nThis sequence leaves white with a decisive material advantage.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc7c8\n```"
