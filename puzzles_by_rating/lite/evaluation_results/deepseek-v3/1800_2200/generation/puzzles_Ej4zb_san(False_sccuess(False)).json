When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the material balance:\n- White has a queen, rook, 2 knights, and several pawns\n- Black has a queen, rook, 2 minor pieces, and pawns\n- White's queen on h7 is very dangerous, attacking f7 and h8\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen is deep in Black's position\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- White has a strong pawn structure with connected passed pawns\n- Black's knight on a1 is trapped and will likely be lost\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White's queen threatens mate on h8 if not addressed\n- White could also play Qxg7+ with devastating effect\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 (blocks the mate threat but loses the rook)\n- e7g6 (blocks with the knight and defends h8)\n- d8d7 (gets the queen out of danger)\n- e8f8 (king moves away from danger)\n5. Evaluating the best option:\n- g8h8 loses material immediately (Qxh8)\n- e7g6 seems best as it:\n  * Blocks the mate threat\n  * Defends h8\n  * Maintains material equality\n  * Keeps the rook on g8 protected\n- Other moves either lose material or don't address the mate threat\n6. After e7g6, possible continuation:\n- White might play Qxg7+ Kxg7\n- But then hxg6 opens the h-file for Black's rook\n- Black would have some counterplay\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne7g6\n```"
