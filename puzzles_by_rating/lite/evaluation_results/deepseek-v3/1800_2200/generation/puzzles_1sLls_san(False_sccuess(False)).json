When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, Rook, 2 pawns\n- Black has: 2 Rooks, Bishop, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White may be slightly better with more active pieces)\n2. Key observations:\n- White's rook on g7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- Black has a queen on c3 attacking White's bishop on d3\n- White's queen on e3 is very powerful, eyeing several squares\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) g7g8 - attacking the rook and threatening mate\nb) e3h6 - threatening mate on h7\nc) d3a6 - pinning the pawn to the rook\nd) f1f7 - doubling rooks on the 7th rank\n4. Analysis of best options:\n- g7g8 looks very strong as it immediately threatens mate (after ...Rxg8, Qxe4+ wins material)\n- e3h6 is also strong but can be met with ...Qe5 blocking\n- d3a6 is interesting but doesn't create immediate threats\n- f1f7 is good but not as forcing as g7g8\n5. After g7g8:\n- If Black takes: 1...Rxg8 2.Qxe4+ Kd7 (or Kf7) 3.Qxg8 and White is winning\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qxe4+ winning the knight\n6. Other moves don't create such immediate threats or win material as directly.\nConclusion: g7g8 is the most forcing and strongest move, leading to either mate or significant material gain.\n```\ng7g8\n```"
