When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Count**: \n   - White has: Knight, Bishop, Pawns (a3, b4, d3, g3, h2)\n   - Black has: Rook, Pawns (b5, h5, g5, f4)\n   - Material is roughly equal (White has minor piece vs Rook, but more pawns)\n2. **King Safety**:\n   - White king is exposed on d2\n   - Black king is relatively safe on h6\n3. **Key Features**:\n   - Black's rook is active on f6\n   - White's knight is well-placed on c6\n   - Black has connected passed pawns on the kingside (g5, h5)\n   - White has potential passed pawn on b4\n4. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - Knight moves: c6e7 looks interesting, attacking the rook\n   - Bishop moves: g2d5 could be strong, controlling key squares\n   - King moves: d2c3 centralizes the king\n   - Pawn moves: a3a4 or d3d4 could be considered\n5. **Deep Analysis**:\n   - c6e7: Attacks the rook, but after Rf6-f7, the knight doesn't have great follow-up\n   - g2d5: Very strong - controls key squares, threatens to join the attack, and prevents Black's pawn advances\n   - d2c3: Good centralization but doesn't address Black's threats immediately\n   - a3a4: Could open lines but is slow\n6. **Best Move**:\n   - g2d5 is the most principled move:\n     * Controls e4 and f7 squares\n     * Prevents Black's g5-g4 push\n     * Can potentially join an attack via f7\n     * Maintains all of White's options\n7. **Potential Lines**:\n   After g2d5, if Black plays g5-g4, we can respond with h2-h4, locking the pawns.\n   Or if Black moves the rook, we can consider centralizing our king.\nThe move g2d5 improves our piece activity while restricting Black's options.\n```\ng2d5\n```"
