When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (no immediate material advantage).\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has strong piece activity with centralized knight on e4 and bishop on c4\n- Black has some pressure with queen on f5 and bishop on d6\n- White's king is somewhat exposed (only g2 pawn protecting)\n- Black's king is exposed on b8 with potential for back rank issues\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) e4f6 - Knight takes knight, forcing recapture and opening lines\nb) c4g8 - Bishop sacrifice on g8, very tempting\nc) c4e6 - Bishop pins the rook to the king\nd) e4d6 - Knight takes bishop, but black can recapture with queen\n4. Deep analysis of c4g8:\n- After c4g8, black must take with rook: rxg8\n- Then e4f6 forks queen and rook, winning material\n- If black plays qxf6, then qxc7 is mate\n- If black plays exf6, then qxc7 is mate\n- This seems like a forced win\n5. Other options:\n- e4f6 is good but not as crushing\n- c4e6 is interesting but doesn't lead to immediate decisive advantage\n- e4d6 allows black to play qxd6 maintaining material balance\n6. Verification:\nAfter c4g8 rxg8 e4f6:\n- If exf6 then qxc7#\n- If qxf6 then qxc7#\n- If any other move, white wins the queen with the fork\nThis appears to be a forced mate or decisive material gain.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc4g8\n```"
