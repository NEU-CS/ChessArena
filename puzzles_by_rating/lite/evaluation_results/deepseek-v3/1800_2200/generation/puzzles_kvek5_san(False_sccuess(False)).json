When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, 2 Knights, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (White may be slightly better with two knights vs bishop+knight)\n2. Positional factors:\n- White has a strong knight on h4 controlling f5\n- Black's knight on d4 is well placed but could be challenged\n- White's pawn structure is solid with pawns on b4, c5, e4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on f7\n- White's king is safe on g1\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4f6: Knight fork attacking rook and bishop\n- h4g6: Knight fork attacking king and rook\n- b1f1: Rook to f-file with potential to attack\n- g3e5: Bishop takes pawn with discovered attack\n4. Deep analysis:\n- g4f6 looks tempting but after ...Kxf6, White doesn't have enough compensation\n- h4g6+ Kxg6 is bad as White loses a knight for pawn\n- b1f1 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- g3e5 is interesting: if ...dxe5 then Nf5+ wins the exchange\n- g4e5 is also strong, threatening Nf5+ after ...dxe5\n5. Best move:\ng4e5 creates multiple threats:\n- If ...dxe5 then Nf5+ wins the rook\n- If ...fxe5 then Bxe5+ wins a pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains strong knights\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous move.\n```\ng4e5\n```"
