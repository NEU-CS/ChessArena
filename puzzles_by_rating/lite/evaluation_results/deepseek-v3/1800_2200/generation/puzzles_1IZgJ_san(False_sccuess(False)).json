When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Balance**: Black is up a pawn (queen vs knight + pawn), but White has active pieces and potential threats.\n2. **Key Features**:\n   - Black's queen is very active on b2, attacking f2 and the a2 pawn\n   - White has a knight on c4 that could become dangerous\n   - Black's bishop on h7 is somewhat trapped\n   - White has a rook on d1 that could become active\n3. **Threats**:\n   - White might play Rd2 to defend the a2 pawn and attack the queen\n   - White could try to activate the knight with moves like Nd6 or Ne5\n4. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **b2h8**: Queen sac to win the rook, but after R\u00d7h8 B\u00d7h8, White has compensation\n   - **b2b8**: Queen retreat, but seems passive\n   - **b2g7**: Attacks the g2 pawn and keeps pressure\n   - **h7g8**: Bishop retreat, but doesn't accomplish much\n   - **d7f6**: Centralizes the knight and defends against potential Nd6\n5. **Best Move**: After considering all options, b2g7 seems strongest because:\n   - It maintains pressure on White's position\n   - Attacks the g2 pawn which is only defended by the king\n   - Prepares potential discovered checks with the bishop\n   - Keeps the queen active and dangerous\n   - After g2 is attacked, White will have to make concessions\nThe move b2g7 creates immediate threats and maintains Black's initiative while keeping all pieces active.\n```\nb2g7\n```"
