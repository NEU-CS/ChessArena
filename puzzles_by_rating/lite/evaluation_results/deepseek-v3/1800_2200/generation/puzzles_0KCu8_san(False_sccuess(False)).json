When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a dangerous passed pawn on g6.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on f7 is very active and threatens the black pawn on b7\n- Black's knight on h4 is well placed but could be vulnerable\n- White's bishop on f5 is strong, controlling important squares\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on b8\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Rxb7+ winning a pawn\n- White could push g7 next move, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- White's pawn structure is more mobile\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8f7 (trading rooks) - but after Rxf7, White's passed pawn becomes more dangerous\n- b8a8 (moving king away) - but doesn't address the threats\n- h4g6 (knight takes pawn) - this seems interesting as it eliminates the dangerous passed pawn\n- d2h6 (bishop checks) - but after Kg1, it doesn't achieve much\n5. After h4g6:\n- White can recapture with fxg6, but then we have Bxg6 and our rook becomes active\n- Or White can play Rxb7+ first, but after Kxb7 Bxg6, we're up material\n- This seems to solve our immediate problems while keeping material balanced\n6. Other moves like d2h6 lead to:\n- Bh6 Kg1 and we haven't really improved our position\n- While h4g6 actively solves the passed pawn threat\nAfter careful consideration, h4g6 is the best move as it:\n- Eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- Opens the f-file for our rook\n- Maintains material balance\n- Doesn't allow White any immediate threats\n```\nh4g6\n```"
