When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material (White has Q+R+R+N vs Black's Q+R+R+B). Black's king is slightly more exposed.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on g4 is attacking White's pawn on h4\n- White's knight on g5 is very active and threatening\n- Black has a rook on d8 controlling the d-file\n- White has doubled rooks on the d-file which could be powerful\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Knight moves: g5h7, g5f7, g5e6 (all attacking the king)\n- Queen moves: d4g7 (threatening mate), d4f6 (attacking f4 pawn)\n- Rook moves: c1c8 (pinning the rook)\n4. Best options:\n- g5h7+ is very tempting as it forks king and queen\n- d4g7 threatens Qg7# which must be dealt with\n- c1c8 pins the rook to the king\n5. Calculating g5h7+:\n- If Kh8, then Qg7# (mate)\n- If Kf8, then Qd6+ Ke8 Qe7# (mate)\n- If Kxh7, then Qh8# (mate)\nThis appears to be forced mate in all variations. The other moves are good but don't deliver immediate mate.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5h7\n```"
