When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, 2 rooks, bishop, pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on d6\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d4 is very active\n- Black's queen on f5 is centralized but exposed\n- White has a rook on c7 putting pressure on the 7th rank\n- Black's knight on h4 is somewhat out of play\n- White's bishop on g2 is strong on the long diagonal\n3. Threats:\n- Black's queen is threatening to take the pawn on f4\n- White has potential threats against Black's king (g2 bishop aiming at b7)\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4g7: Queen sacrifice to expose the king\n- c7f7: Pinning the black queen to the king\n- d6d7: Advancing the passed pawn\n- g2b7: Bishop sacrifice to open the king\n5. Deep analysis:\n- d4g7 looks tempting: 31...Qxg7 32.Rxg7+ Kxg7 33.Qxe6 with strong play, but Black can defend\n- c7f7 is strong: 31...Qxf7 32.Qxf7+ Kxf7 33.d7 and the pawn is unstoppable\n- After c7f7, if 31...Qxc2 32.Qxf5 exf5 33.d7 and the pawn promotes\n6. Best move:\nc7f7 creates multiple winning threats - either winning the queen or promoting the pawn. Black has no good defense.\n```\nc7f7\n```"
