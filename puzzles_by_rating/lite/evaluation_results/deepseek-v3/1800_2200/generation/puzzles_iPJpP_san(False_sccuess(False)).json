When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, 2 rooks, 2 pawns (one passed on e7)\n- Black has queen, 2 rooks, bishop, 4 pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has a dangerous passed pawn on e7\n2. Key features:\n- White's e7 pawn is one step from promotion\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- Black has doubled rooks on the a-file\n- Black has a passed pawn on g4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) e7e8q - promoting the pawn immediately\nb) f4f6 - attacking black's queen while threatening mate\nc) e1e6 - activating the rook with threats\n4. Analysis:\n- e7e8q looks tempting, but after Qxe8 Rxe8 Rxe8, Black can play Qf5+ with counterplay\n- f4f6 is strong: Qxf6 exf6+ Kxf6 Rxe6+ wins material\n- e1e6 is also good, threatening Re7+ and supporting e8 promotion\n5. Best move:\nf4f6 is the most forcing and winning move. It:\n- Attacks the queen\n- Threatens Qxg6# if queen moves\n- If Qxf6, then exf6+ wins the queen\n- If queen moves away, Qxg6# is mate\nBlack has no good defense here. The only way to avoid mate is Qxf6, but then White wins the queen with exf6+.\n```\nf4f6\n```"
