When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Evaluation**:\n   - Black has a bishop and queen vs. white's knight and pawns\n   - White has a passed pawn on e6 that's very dangerous\n   - Black's king is exposed while white's king is relatively safe\n2. **Key Threats**:\n   - White's e6 pawn is threatening to promote (e6-e7 next)\n   - Black needs to either stop the pawn or create counterplay\n3. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **e7f6**: Blocking the pawn with the bishop\n     - But after e7f6, white can play e6xf6 and the pawn is still dangerous\n   - **b2e5**: Queen checks the king\n     - After Kf5xe5, black can play f2xe3 with discovered check, but white's pawns are still dangerous\n   - **b2c3**: Attacking the knight\n     - White can move the knight or push e6-e7\n   - **f2e3**: Moving the king towards the pawn\n     - But white can push e6-e7 immediately\n4. **Best Solution**:\n   - The most forcing and best move is **b2e5+**, giving a check that forces the white king to take the queen\n   - After 1...b2e5+ 2.Kxe5 f2xe3+, black gets the knight with check\n   - Then after 3.Kf5 (or Kd5) exf4, black has bishop vs pawns but can likely stop the remaining pawns\n5. **Why other moves don't work as well**:\n   - Blocking the pawn (e7f6) doesn't stop it permanently\n   - Other queen moves don't create enough counterplay\n   - King moves don't address the immediate pawn threat\nThe move b2e5+ leads to a forced sequence where black can eliminate white's most dangerous pieces while maintaining material balance.\n```\nb2e5\n```"
