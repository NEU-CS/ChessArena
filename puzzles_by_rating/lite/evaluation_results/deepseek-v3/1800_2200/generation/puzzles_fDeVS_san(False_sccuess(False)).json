When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: King, Bishop, Pawn (on e6 and f5)\n- Black has: King, Knight, 3 pawns (a7, b6, h5)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n2. Key features:\n- White's e6 pawn is passed and dangerous, but currently blocked by Black's knight.\n- White's bishop controls important squares but is limited by pawn structure.\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed but can still defend.\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to push e6-e7, which would be very dangerous.\n- Black needs to maintain control over e7 square to prevent this.\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e7f6: King moves toward center but exposes to checks.\n- e7d6: King moves toward White's pawns but may be too passive.\n- c5d7: Knight moves to defend e5 square, but allows e6-e7.\n- c5e6: Knight captures the dangerous pawn, but after fxe6, White gets a passed f-pawn.\n- c5e4: Knight jumps forward, attacking bishop but allowing e6-e7.\n- b6b5: Pawn move, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n- h5h4: Pawn move, not relevant to main play.\n5. Best option:\nc5e6 seems forced to eliminate the dangerous passed pawn, despite giving White a passed f-pawn. After:\n- c5e6 f5xe6\nBlack can then bring the king closer with e7f6 to help stop the pawn.\nOther moves either allow e6-e7 immediately or don't address the main threat.\nHere's the move:\n```\nc5e6\n```"
