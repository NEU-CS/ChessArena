When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has Q+R+B+N vs Black's Q+R+B+N). However, White has a more active position.\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on e7 is very active, putting pressure on the 7th rank\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n- Black has a strong bishop on b6 attacking f2\n- White's queen is well placed on a4, eyeing the a4-e8 diagonal\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8 (queening the rook) - but Black can simply take with their rook\n- a4e8 (queen sacrifice) - interesting, but after Rxe8 Rxe8, Black has Qxb2 counterplay\n- c1h6 (bishop sacrifice) - tempting, but after gxh6 Qxh6, Black has defensive resources\n- f3g5 (knight move) - threatens Nxh7, but Black can defend with ...h5\n- a4a6 (queen move) - pins the bishop and threatens Qxb6\n4. Best move seems to be a4a6:\n- It pins the bishop to the queen (if Bxa6, Qxb6 wins the queen)\n- Black cannot easily defend the bishop (if ...Qc7, then Rxb7 wins material)\n- It maintains all of White's positional advantages\n- It doesn't allow any counterplay for Black\nOther moves either don't achieve as much or allow Black counterplay. The pin is very strong here.\nHere's the move:\n```\na4a6\n```"
