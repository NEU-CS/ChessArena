When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n- White has Q, R, N, R vs Black's Q, R, 3 pawns\n- White is up a knight but Black has some pawns\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is on d6, rook on f3\n- White's queen is on f5, rook on e2, knight on h3\n- Black's king is on g8, White's king on h2\n- Black has threats like Qxh2# if White isn't careful\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- h2h1/h2g1: King moves seem passive and don't address threats\n- f5e5: Queen moves away from protecting h3 knight\n- f5f4: Queen moves forward but doesn't accomplish much\n- h3f4: Knight moves to attack Black's rook on f3\n- e2e5: Rook moves to e5, attacking queen but allowing Qxh2#\n- g2g3: Pawn move blocks potential Qxh2# but weakens king\n4. Best candidate moves:\n- h3f4 looks strong as it attacks the rook on f3\n- After h3f4, if Black takes with rook (f3xf4), then Qxf4 wins material\n- If Black moves rook away, we maintain pressure\n- Other moves either don't improve our position or allow mate threats\n5. Calculating h3f4:\n- h3f4 attacks rook\n- If f3xf4, Qxf4 and we win the rook\n- If Black moves rook (say f3-f2), then Qxd6 wins queen\n- If Black plays Qxh2+, Kxh2 and we're up material\n6. Other moves have issues:\n- e2e5 allows Qxh2# immediately\n- g2g3 weakens king position unnecessarily\n- King moves don't accomplish anything\nThe best move is clearly h3f4, as it actively attacks Black's rook while maintaining all our threats and not allowing any counterplay.\n```\nh3f4\n```"
