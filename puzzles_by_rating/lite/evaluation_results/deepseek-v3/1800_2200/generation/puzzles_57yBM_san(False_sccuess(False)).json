When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (Black has Rook + Bishop + pawns vs White's Rook + Bishop + pawns)\n2. White's Rook is on e6, attacking Black's pawn on f6 (but there is no f6 pawn - this must be a misreading)\n3. Black's Rook on d7 is very active\n4. White's Bishop on c3 is very strong, controlling key diagonals\n5. Black's King is exposed on g5\n6. White's pawn structure is slightly better\nLooking at the legal moves:\n1. **Rook moves (d7...)**:\n   - d7d8: Queening square, but White's Rook can capture (e6e8)\n   - d7g7: Defends h7 pawn and creates potential for back rank threats\n   - d7f7: Could be useful to defend f4 pawn later\n   - d7e7: Exchanges Rooks, but after e6xe7, White's Bishop becomes dominant\n2. **King moves (h5h4)**:\n   - h5h4: Advances King but exposes it more\n3. **c2 moves**:\n   - c2c3: Pinning White's Bishop to the King\n   - c2g2: Could be interesting to create threats\n4. **Pawn moves**:\n   - h7h6: Solid but passive\n   - b7b6/b5: Doesn't accomplish much\n   - g5g4: Advances pawn but weakens King\n   - f4f3: Advances pawn, creates potential for f2 push\nThe most forcing move is **c2c3**, pinning White's Bishop to the King. This creates immediate tactical threats:\n- If White moves the King, we can capture the Bishop\n- If White doesn't move the King, the Bishop is paralyzed\n- It also clears c2 for potential Rook maneuvers\nOther moves either don't create threats or expose our position too much. The pin is the most principled move here.\n```\nc2c3\n```"
