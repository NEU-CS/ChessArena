When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has queen + rook + minor pieces vs White's queen + rook + minor pieces). However, White has a passed pawn on e6 which could become dangerous.\n2. King safety: White's king is somewhat exposed on g1, while Black's king is safer on g8. Black has pressure along the f-file with their rook on f5.\n3. Key observations:\n   - Black's bishop on d4 is very strong, controlling important squares\n   - White's bishop on e3 is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n   - Black has potential threats with ...Rxf2 or ...Qxg2+\n   - White needs to activate pieces and defend against threats\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e3h6: Bishop sacrifice to expose Black's king\n   - e2g4: Queen move to defend g2 and attack g6\n   - f1d2: Rook move to defend against ...Rxf2\n   - a1d1: Rook centralization\n   - e3d4: Trading the strong Black bishop\n5. Best move analysis:\n   - e3h6 looks tempting but after gxh6, White doesn't have enough follow-up\n   - e2g4 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threats\n   - f1d2 is too passive\n   - a1d1 is interesting but doesn't solve the bishop issue\n   - e3d4 is strong because:\n     * Removes Black's powerful bishop\n     * After cxd4, White can play Qd3 with pressure on d4 and g6\n     * Opens the e-file for White's rook\n     * Maintains control of key squares\nThe best move is to trade off Black's strong bishop with e3d4. This improves White's piece activity while reducing Black's attacking potential.\n```\ne3d4\n```"
