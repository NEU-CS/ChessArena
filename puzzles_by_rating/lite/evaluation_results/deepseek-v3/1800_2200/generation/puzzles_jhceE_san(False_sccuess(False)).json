When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Rook, Bishop, Knight and pawns each). Black has doubled rooks on the g-file which could be useful.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7, while White's king is on f2. Both kings are vulnerable.\n3. Pawn structure: Black has a passed d-pawn but it's blockaded by White's e3 pawn. White has a passed a-pawn but it's far from promotion.\n4. Piece activity: Black's rook on g8 is active, bishop on e6 is well placed, knight on c4 is strong. White's rooks are connected but not very active.\n5. Threats: White has potential threats like Rg1-g7 or Rb1-b7 to attack Black's king. Black needs to be careful about back rank threats.\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- g8h8: Doesn't accomplish much, just moves the rook to a passive square\n- g7g6: Could be considered to give the king some air\n- e6c8: Develops the bishop but seems passive\n- c4d6: Centralizes the knight and threatens to jump to f5 or e4\n- c4e5: Attacks the f3 pawn and gains space\n- d5d4: Opens lines but gives up the passed pawn\nThe most promising moves seem to be c4e5 or c4d6.\nAfter c4e5:\n- Attacks the f3 pawn which is defended by the bishop on g3\n- If White plays fxe5, then fxe5 opens the f-file for Black's rook\n- The knight becomes very active on e5\nAfter c4d6:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Prepares to jump to f5 or e4\n- But doesn't create immediate threats\nBetween these, c4e5 seems more forcing and creates immediate pressure. It also maintains the option to sacrifice on f3 if needed.\nLooking deeper:\nAfter c4e5, if White ignores it, Black can consider moves like Rg8-g2+ or e5xf3. The knight becomes a powerful outpost.\nTherefore, the best move appears to be:\n```\nc4e5\n```"
