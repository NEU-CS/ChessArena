When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but Black has some positional advantages.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a strong knight on d7 that can potentially jump to f6 or e5\n- White's queen on f4 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4 that could become dangerous\n- Both kings are somewhat exposed\n- Black has the bishop pair\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6d6: Centralizing the queen while attacking the g6 pawn\n- d7f6: Developing the knight to a strong square, attacking the queen\n- e8g8: Castling to safety\n- b4c3: Creating a passed pawn and opening lines\n4. Evaluating the best options:\n- b6d6 looks tempting as it centralizes the queen and attacks g6, but White can defend with Qf4-g3\n- d7f6 is strong as it develops a piece, attacks the queen, and prepares to castle\n- e8g8 is safe but doesn't develop any initiative\n- b4c3 is interesting but might be premature as the pawn is well protected\n5. After d7f6, if White moves the queen (likely Qf4-g3), Black can follow up with 0-0-0, connecting rooks and bringing the king to safety.\n6. The knight on f6 also puts pressure on e4 and supports potential ...d5 breaks in the future.\nTherefore, the best move is developing the knight while gaining tempo on the queen:\n```\nd7f6\n```"
