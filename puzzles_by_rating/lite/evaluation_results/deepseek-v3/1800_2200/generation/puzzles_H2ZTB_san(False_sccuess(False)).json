When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, 2 Bishops, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Queen, Rook, 2 Knights, Bishop, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White may be slightly better due to bishop pair)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on h2\n- Black king is on g8 with some pawn cover\n3. Key features:\n- White has a knight on d6 that's very active\n- Black has a rook on e5 controlling important squares\n- White has two bishops pointing at Black's kingside\n- Black's queen on h7 is somewhat passive\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) d6e8 - Knight fork attacking queen and king\nb) g5d8 - Bishop sacrifice to expose king\nc) f1f8 - Rook lift to attack along the 8th rank\nd) g2d5 - Queen move attacking the rook\nLet me evaluate these:\na) d6e8 - After Kxe8, Qxh7 wins the queen, but Black gets Rf5 with counterplay\nb) g5d8 - Sacrificing the bishop: Kxd8, Qxh7 but Black has Qxh7 and we lose material\nc) f1f8 - Interesting, but Black can play Qxf8 and we don't have immediate follow-up\nd) g2d5 - Attacks the rook on e5, but Black can simply move it\nThe best move appears to be d6e8, as it forces the king to take and we win the queen, even though Black gets some counterplay with the rook. The material gain is significant and should be decisive.\nOther moves either don't achieve as much or risk losing material. The knight fork is the most forcing and concrete winning line.\n```\nd6e8\n```"
