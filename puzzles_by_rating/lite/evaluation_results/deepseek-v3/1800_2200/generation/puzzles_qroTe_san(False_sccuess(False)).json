When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (Black has knight vs White's bishop)\n2. Black's king is more active (d6 vs White's e2)\n3. White has a passed pawn on f6 that could be dangerous\n4. Black has pawn weaknesses on a4 and e4\n5. White's bishop is very active on a7\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Knight moves: f7h6 looks interesting to attack the f6 pawn\n2. King moves: d6c7 or d6e6 to centralize\n3. Pawn moves: e4e3 to create counterplay\nLet's evaluate:\n- f7h6: Attacks f6 pawn, but after f6f7, White's pawn becomes very dangerous\n- d6c7: Centralizes king, but allows White to push f6-f7\n- d6e6: Better, as it blocks the f-pawn's advance\n- e4e3: Creates a passed pawn, but after Kxe3, Black's position remains passive\nThe most critical factor is stopping White's f-pawn. d6e6 seems best as it:\n1. Blocks the f-pawn's advance\n2. Centralizes the king\n3. Prepares to support Black's own pawns\n4. Maintains flexibility\nOther moves either allow the f-pawn to advance or don't improve Black's position sufficiently.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd6e6\n```"
