When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black has castling rights (KQkq) but hasn't castled yet\n- White has a knight on f3 and h2, bishop on f4\n- Black has pawns on c5, e6, g6, with knights on c6 and e5\n- Black's dark-squared bishop is on d7\n- Queens are still on the board (White's on e2, Black's on d8)\n- Black's king is still in the center on e8\n2. Key observations:\n- White has some pressure on the e5 knight (pawn on f4, knight on f3)\n- Black's king safety is a concern since it's still in the center\n- The h8 rook is currently inactive\n- The e5 knight is well-placed but potentially under attack\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Castling (e8g8): Would improve king safety\n- d8c7: Developing the queen to a safer square\n- e5g4: Knight jump attacking h2 pawn\n- h8g8: Preparing to castle manually\n4. Evaluating the best options:\n- Castling (e8g8) is very tempting as it immediately solves king safety\n- e5g4 looks aggressive but after h3xg4, White gets open h-file\n- d8c7 is solid but doesn't address king safety\n- h8g8 is preparatory but delays castling\n5. Potential threats if we don't castle:\n- White could play moves like 0-0-0, bringing more pressure\n- The center could open up, making the king vulnerable\n- White's pieces are well-developed for an attack\n6. Conclusion:\nCastling is the most principled move here, getting the king to safety and connecting the rooks. While there are other reasonable moves, none address the king safety issue as directly as castling.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne8g8\n```"
