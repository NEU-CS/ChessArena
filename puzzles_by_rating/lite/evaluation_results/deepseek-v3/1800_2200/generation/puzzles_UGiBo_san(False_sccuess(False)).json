When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

After Bxe3, White can recapture with the bishop, but this might lead to simplifications.\n   - **h1g1**: Preparing to castle kingside, but Black's pieces are well-placed to attack after castling.\n   - **a1d1**: Doubling rooks on the d-file, putting pressure on Black's position.\n   - **d2d8**: A tempting queen sacrifice, but after Rxd8, White doesn't have enough compensation.\n4. **Best Move**:\n   - **d2e3** is the most forcing and best move. It removes the annoying knight and opens up the position for White's pieces. After Bxe3, White can recapture with the bishop (f3xe3), maintaining control of the center and opening the f-file for the rook.\nHere's the move:\n```\nd2e3\n```"
