When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has an extra pawn but White has better piece activity)\n2. King safety: White's king is castled but Black's king is still in the center (on c8). This suggests we should look for attacking chances.\n3. Key observations:\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on h3\n- Black's dark-squared bishop is very strong on b6\n- White's knight on f3 is pinned to the queen by Black's bishop on b6\n- White's bishop on b2 is blocked by its own pawn on b3\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) f3g5 - unpins the knight and attacks h7\nb) b1c3 - develops the knight and defends e2\nc) d2e2 - unpins the knight by moving the queen\nd) b2h8 - sacrifices the bishop to expose Black's king\n5. Evaluating f3g5:\n- Immediately unpins the knight\n- Threatens Nxh7 winning the exchange\n- Black can defend with ...Rh5 but this weakens their position\n- Creates potential for a kingside attack\n6. Other moves have drawbacks:\n- b1c3 is solid but doesn't address the pin\n- d2e2 leaves the queen awkwardly placed\n- b2h8 is too speculative as Black can decline with ...Kxh8\n7. After f3g5, if Black plays ...Rh5, we can follow up with Qd2-f4 increasing pressure on f5 and h6 squares.\nThe move f3g5 is the most active and solves our immediate problems while creating threats of its own.\n```\nf3g5\n```"
