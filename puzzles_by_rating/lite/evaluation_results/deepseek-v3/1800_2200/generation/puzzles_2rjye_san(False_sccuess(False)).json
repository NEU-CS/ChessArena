When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and position:\n- White has: King on e3, Bishop on g8, Bishop on b4, pawn on e6\n- Black has: King on c6, pawns on g6/h6/b5, Rook on h3\n- White is to move (as per FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's rook is attacking White's king (check)\n- White must get out of check\n- White has a passed pawn on e6 that could promote soon\n- Black's king is close to White's e-pawn\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- e3f4: Moves king towards center but away from e-pawn\n- e3e4: Moves king towards e-pawn but exposes to potential checks\n- e3d4: Moves king towards e-pawn and away from rook's file\n- e3f2: Moves king away from action\n- e3e2: Keeps king on e-file but moves away from pawn\n- e3d2: Moves king away from action\n4. Best candidate moves:\n- e3d4 seems most promising as it:\n  - Gets out of check\n  - Moves towards the passed e-pawn to support its promotion\n  - Moves away from the rook's file (h-file)\n  - Keeps the king active in the center\n5. Calculating variations after e3d4:\n- Black will likely bring king to d6 to stop the pawn\n- Then White can push e7 and potentially win the pawn race\n- The bishops can help control key squares\n6. Other moves are inferior:\n- Moving king away from center (f4/f2/e2/d2) wastes time\n- e3e4 leaves king exposed to potential checks\nThe best move is:\n```\ne3d4\n```"
