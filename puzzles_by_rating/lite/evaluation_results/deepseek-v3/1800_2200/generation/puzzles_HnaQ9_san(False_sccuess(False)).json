When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: pawn (f7), bishop, rook, pawn (h2), king\n- Black has: rook (b8), pawns (g6,d5,h5), queen (b1), king\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has a dangerous passed pawn on f7 that's threatening to promote.\n2. Immediate threats:\n- White's f7 pawn is one move away from queening. If it promotes, White will have a decisive material advantage.\n- Black's queen is attacking White's rook on f2, but this is not the most pressing issue.\n3. King safety:\n- White's king is exposed on h3, but Black doesn't have immediate mating threats.\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8.\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g8h8: Moves king away from potential checks, but doesn't address the f7 pawn\n- g8f8: Puts king in front of the pawn, but White can simply push f8=Q+\n- g8h7: Moves king towards the pawn, but allows f8=Q with check\n- g8g7: Blocks the pawn's path, but White can play Rxf7! winning\n- g8f7: Captures the pawn immediately\n5. Best move:\ng8f7 is the only move that directly stops the pawn from promoting. After:\n- g8f7 (Kxf7)\n- White can play Rxf7+ (Rook takes king), but then:\n  - Kxf7 (king takes rook)\n  - And the position is roughly equal with both sides having queen and pawns\nOther moves either allow immediate promotion or lose material. While g8f7 gives up the king's safety temporarily, it's necessary to stop the pawn from queening.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng8f7\n```"
