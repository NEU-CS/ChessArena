When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, queen vs White's rook, knight, queen). The position is dynamically balanced.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on b7\n- White has a strong knight on f5 attacking g7 and e7\n- Black's pawn structure is solid but has some weaknesses (h4 pawn is isolated)\n- White has a passed d5 pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6f7: Queen trade, but after Qxf7 Rxf7, White's knight remains strong\n- d8d7: Centralizing the rook, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f8g7: Developing the bishop to defend g7 and potentially create threats\n- e6e7: Protecting the e5 pawn and maintaining queen activity\n4. Threats to address:\n- White's knight on f5 is very strong and needs to be challenged\n- White may try to advance the d-pawn or attack the black king\nAfter careful consideration, f8g7 seems the most principled move:\n- Develops the bishop to a strong diagonal\n- Defends the g7 square against the knight\n- Prepares potential future attacks on the queenside\n- Maintains flexibility for other pieces\nOther moves either don't address the knight threat or lead to worse positions after trades.\n```\nf8g7\n```"
