When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the position:\n- White has a bishop on g5, knight on c3 and e2, pawns on a2,b2,c2,e4,g3,h2\n- Black has a knight on g4, queen on b6, bishop on b7, knight on d7\n- White's king is castled on h1, black's king is still in the center\n- Black's knight on g4 is attacking White's pawn on e4\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's knight on g4 is a threat, attacking e4 pawn\n- White's bishop on g5 is very active, pinning black's knight on d7 to the queen\n- White has potential for a strong attack if he can maintain the initiative\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5d8: Bishop takes rook - tempting, but after ...Qxd8, black's queen gets active\n- g5e7: Bishop takes knight - good, removes defender of black's king\n- e2f4: Knight takes knight - solves the immediate threat to e4 pawn\n- f1f7: Rook sacrifice - interesting but premature\n4. Evaluating g5e7:\n- After Bxe7 Qxe7, White can play Nf4, removing the threat to e4\n- This opens the f-file for White's rook\n- Black's king remains exposed in the center\n- White maintains pressure\n5. Evaluating e2f4:\n- Nxg4 exf4\n- This solves the immediate threat but gives black's pawn more central control\n- Less dynamic than g5e7\n6. Evaluating g5d8:\n- Bxd8 Qxd8\n- Black's queen becomes active and can join the defense\n- Not as strong as g5e7\n7. Best move is g5e7:\n- It removes an important defender of black's king\n- Maintains pressure on black's position\n- Keeps the initiative\n- Follow-up with Nf4 or other active moves\nThe move g5e7 is the most principled and strongest in this position, maintaining White's initiative and attacking chances.\n```\ng5e7\n```"
