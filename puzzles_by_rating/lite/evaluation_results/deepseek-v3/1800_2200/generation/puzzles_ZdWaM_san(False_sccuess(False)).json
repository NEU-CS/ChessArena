When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, B, 4 pawns\n- Black has: 2R, N, Q, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop pair potential)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on g7 is very active\n- Black's queen on f2 is threatening but somewhat exposed\n- White's bishop on e5 is strong\n- Black has doubled rooks on the d-file\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7g8 (promoting the pawn to a queen with check)\n- e5f6 (capturing the knight with bishop)\n- a3d6 (queen sacrifice to win material)\n- d1d3 (connecting rooks and defending f3)\n4. Deep analysis of top candidates:\na) g7g8:\n- Promotes to queen with check, forcing black to respond\n- After Kxg8, we can play Qxf2 winning the queen\n- But then black plays Rxd1+ and we lose our rook\n- Net result: we trade Q+R for Q+R, not gaining anything\nb) e5f6:\n- Captures the knight, but black can play Qxe1+ winning our rook\n- After Kxe1, Rxd1+ and we're worse\nc) a3d6:\n- Brilliant queen sacrifice! If Rxd6, then Bf6+ wins the rook back\n- After Kb8 (only legal move), Bxd8 Rxd8\n- We're up a bishop for a pawn in the endgame\n- This seems like the best option\nd) d1d3:\n- Solid but doesn't capitalize on our active pieces\n- Black can consolidate with moves like Rd7\n5. Conclusion:\nThe queen sacrifice a3d6 is the most promising, leading to a favorable endgame where we're up material. The tactics work out in our favor after careful calculation.\n```\na3d6\n```"
