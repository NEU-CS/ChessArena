When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (f5), Queen (c4), Bishop (b2), Rook (f1), pawns (a3, b4, g3, h2)\n- Black has: King (g8), Queen (b6), Rook (e6), Knight (g6), pawns (a7, b7, g7, h6)\n- Material is roughly equal (White has Q+R+R+B vs Black's Q+R+N)\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on f5 is very active\n- Black's queen is exposed on b6\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with only pawn cover\n- White has a passed pawn on b4 that could be dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) f5f7 - attacking the g7 pawn and threatening mate\nb) c4e6 - exchanging queens while forking the rook\nc) b2g7 - sacrificing bishop to expose black's king\n4. Deep analysis:\n- f5f7 looks very strong:\n  - If ...gxf7, then Qxg7# (immediate mate)\n  - If ...Qxf7, then Qxe6 wins the rook\n  - If ...Kxf7, then Qxe6+ wins the rook\n  - Black's only defense is ...Rxf7, but then Qxb6 wins the queen\n- c4e6 is good but less forcing:\n  - After Qxe6 Rxe6, Black can play ...Nf4 with counterplay\n- b2g7 is tempting but less clear:\n  - After ...Kxg7 Qxg7+ Kxg7 Rf7+ Kh8, White has compensation but no clear win\n5. Conclusion:\nf5f7 is the most forcing move that either leads to mate or wins significant material. It's the strongest move in the position.\n```\nf5f7\n```"
