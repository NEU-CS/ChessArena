When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (White has knight + pawns vs Black's knight + pawns)\n2. White's king is on c4, Black's king is on c6\n3. Black has a passed e-pawn that's currently blocked by White's f3 pawn\n4. White has a passed c-pawn on c5\n5. Black's knight is on b7, White's knight is on a4\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c4d4 - King moves towards center\n2. c4b4 - King moves towards queenside\n3. a4b6 - Knight fork attacking king and knight\n4. f3e4 - Capturing the dangerous passed pawn\n5. g4f5 - Pushing the g-pawn\nLet's evaluate these:\n1. c4d4:\n   - King centralizes but allows Black to push e4-e3\n   - After e3, White's f-pawn is pinned and Black can play ...Nd6 attacking c5 pawn\n   - Not ideal\n2. c4b4:\n   - King moves away from center, doesn't seem productive\n   - Black can continue with ...e3 or ...Nd6\n3. a4b6:\n   - This looks promising - fork attacking king and knight\n   - After Kxb6, White can play c5-c6 creating a passed pawn\n   - But Black can play Kxb6 and then ...e3 is strong\n   - Might not be best\n4. f3e4:\n   - Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n   - After fxe4, Black can play g4 attacking the e4 pawn\n   - But White can defend with Ke4 or push c6\n   - This seems solid as it eliminates Black's most dangerous asset\n5. g4f5:\n   - Pushing the pawn but allows Black to play e3\n   - After e3, White's position becomes difficult\n   - Not best\nAfter careful consideration, f3e4 seems strongest as it:\n- Eliminates Black's dangerous passed pawn\n- Maintains White's pawn structure\n- Keeps the c5 pawn protected\n- Doesn't allow Black any counterplay\nOther moves either allow Black's pawn to advance or don't improve White's position sufficiently.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf3e4\n```"
