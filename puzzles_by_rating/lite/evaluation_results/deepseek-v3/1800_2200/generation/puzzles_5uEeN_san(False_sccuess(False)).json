When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has rook (f8), queen (e5), rook (h1), pawns (g6, c5, h7)\n- White has rook (a6), knight (e7), queen (f5), pawns (d5, g3, f3, h6)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has a dangerous passed pawn on h6\n2. Key features:\n- White's h6 pawn is very advanced and threatening to promote\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n- White's pieces are very active (queen on f5, knight on e7)\n- Black's rooks are not optimally placed (f8 rook blocked by own pawns)\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qf5-g6+ winning the g6 pawn\n- White also has ideas like Ne7-g6+ or pushing h6-h7\n- Black needs to address these threats while creating counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5g7: Queen sacrifice to stop h-pawn, but after hxg7 h7, White still promotes\n- e5f6: Blocks the queen's attack on g6, but allows h6-h7\n- f8f7: Defends g7 but allows Qxg6+\n- h1h6: Captures the dangerous pawn, but after Rxh6, White has Qxg6+ with strong attack\n5. Best move:\nAfter careful consideration, h1h6 is the most forcing and best move:\n- It eliminates the immediate threat of the h-pawn\n- After 1...h1h6 2.a6xh6, Black can play 2...e5g7! with counterplay\n- White cannot take the queen due to mate: 3.hxg7?? f8h8#\nThis leads to complications where Black gets sufficient counterplay against White's exposed king.\n```\nh1h6\n```"
