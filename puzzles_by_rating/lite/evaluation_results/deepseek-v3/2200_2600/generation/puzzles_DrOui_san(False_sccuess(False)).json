When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- White has a knight on d5, bishop on c4, queen on d1, rook on f1, king on h1\n- Black has pawns on a7, c7, f7, g7, h7; bishop on c5, knight on g4, queen on d8, rook on f8, king on g8\n- Black's knight is attacking White's undefended pawn on h2\n- White's knight on d5 is very active and threatening\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's knight on g4 is a problem as it threatens h2 pawn\n- White's knight on d5 is excellently placed, attacking c7 and e7 squares\n- Black's king is still in the center (castled kingside but rook is on f8)\n- White has the bishop pair which could become powerful in an open position\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7+ (forking king and queen)\n- d5c7 (attacking the rook)\n- g2g3 (challenging the knight)\n- d1g4 (trading queens)\n4. Analyzing d5e7+:\n- Forces the king to move (likely to h8)\n- Then we can play Qd4 with strong threats\n- This maintains initiative and keeps pressure\n5. Analyzing d5c7:\n- Attacks the rook but allows Black to defend with Qd7\n- Not as forcing as e7 check\n6. Analyzing g2g3:\n- Deals with the knight threat but is passive\n- Allows Black to consolidate\n7. Analyzing d1g4:\n- Trades queens but gives up our active queen\n- Black can recapture with knight, maintaining pressure\n8. Best move:\nd5e7+ is the most forcing and strongest move. It:\n- Creates an immediate threat\n- Maintains initiative\n- Opens possibilities for further attacks\n- The check gives White tempo to develop more threats\nAll other moves either don't address the knight threat or don't maintain the initiative as strongly. The knight fork is the most principled and strongest continuation.\n```\nd5e7\n```"
