When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, knight vs White's rook, bishop, knight). The pawn structure is complex but balanced.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is slightly exposed on g8\n- White has pressure along the h-file with rooks doubled\n- Black's bishop on b5 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White has a passed pawn on g5 that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) King safety: g8h8 or g8g7\nb) Rook activity: c8e8 or c8c4\nc) Bishop moves: b5e8 or b5d7\nd) Pawn moves: f7f6 or h7h6\n4. Evaluating the best options:\n- g8h8 looks passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n- c8e8 could be interesting to challenge White's rook on h3\n- b5e8 seems strong, protecting the king while maintaining the bishop's activity\n- f7f6 would weaken the e6 pawn and king position\n5. The best move appears to be b5e8 because:\n- It protects the king from potential checks along the 8th rank\n- Maintains the bishop's active position\n- Prepares potential future rook lifts via e8\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Keeps options open for both defense and counterplay\nOther moves either create weaknesses or don't improve Black's position as much. For example, c8e8 would be met with Rh3h8+ winning the exchange after Be8xh8 Rxh8.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb5e8\n```"
