When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, queen vs White's rook, knight, queen). White has a passed b-pawn which could become dangerous.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on e5 is very strong, attacking multiple squares near Black's king.\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8.\n- White has a rook on c1 controlling the open c-file.\n- Black's queen on c7 is somewhat tied to defending the c5 pawn.\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Knight fork attacking king and queen\n- e5d7: Knight fork attacking queen and rook\n- e3h6: Queen move threatening mate on h7\n- c1c4: Rook lift to potentially double on c-file or attack kingside\n4. Analyzing e5f7:\n- After e5f7+ Kxf7 (forced), Qxc7 wins the queen but Black has Bxc7.\n- White gets queen for rook and bishop, which is roughly equal material but loses initiative.\n5. Analyzing e5d7:\n- After e5d7 Qxd7 (if takes), Qxc5 wins a pawn but Black can play Qe7 maintaining equality.\n- If Black plays Qc6 instead, White can play Qxc6 bxc6 and White has a small edge.\n6. Analyzing e3h6:\n- Threatens Qxh7# next move.\n- Black must respond with g7g6, then White can play Qh3 maintaining pressure.\n- This seems very promising as it keeps strong attacking chances.\n7. Analyzing c1c4:\n- Good positional move, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n- Black can respond with ...Qc6 or ...Rc8.\nAfter careful consideration, e3h6 seems strongest as it creates immediate mating threats and forces Black to weaken their kingside. The other moves either lead to exchanges or don't maintain the initiative as strongly.\nHere's the move:\n```\ne3h6\n```"
