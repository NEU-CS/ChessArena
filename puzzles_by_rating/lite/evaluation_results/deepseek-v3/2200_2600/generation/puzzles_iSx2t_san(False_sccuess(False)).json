When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (c6), Queen (f3), pawns (b3, d4, e5, f4, g5, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (g8), Rook (a7), Queen (a2), pawns (b6, d5, f7, g6, h5)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a strong centralized position.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's pawn structure is very strong with pawns on e5 and f4 controlling space.\n- Black's king is exposed on e8 with White's rook on c6 eyeing it.\n- Black's queen is oddly placed on a2, not doing much.\n- White's queen on f3 is very active, eyeing h5 and potentially the black king.\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxh5 soon, winning a pawn and exposing the black king further.\n- White might try to double rooks on the c-file to increase pressure.\n4. Candidate moves for Black:\n- g8h8: Gets the rook off the open file, but passive.\n- e8f8: Moves king away from c-file pressure.\n- a7e7: Challenges White's rook on c6.\n- a2a6: Queen gets more active, threatens b6 pawn.\n5. Best options:\n- a7e7 seems most principled, challenging White's active rook. After Rxe7, Kxe7, Black's king is safer and material remains equal.\n- a2a6 is also interesting, activating the queen and defending b6.\nBetween these, a7e7 seems more forcing and solves the immediate pressure. After Rxe7 Kxe7, Black's position is more solid.\nLet me verify:\nIf a7e7 Rxe7 Kxe7, then Qxh5 is met with Qe6 defending. Black's position holds.\nOther moves like e8f8 allow Qxh5 immediately with serious threats.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na7e7\n```"
