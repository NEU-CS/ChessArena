When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, 2 pawns\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Bishop, 2 pawns\nWhite is up a bishop and pawn, but Black has some counterplay.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g2, attacking multiple squares\n- White's queen on e6 is very strong\n- Black's rook on g8 is tied to defending the g7 square against White's rook\n- Black's h-pawn is advanced but blocked by White's bishop\n- White has a passed b-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is White's rook on g7 attacking Black's rook\n- White could potentially play Qe6xg8 if Black's rook moves\n- Black's queen can deliver checks or capture pawns\n4. Candidate moves:\na) h8g7 - trades rooks but leaves Black's queen vs White's queen+bishop\nb) g2a8 - queen swing to attack White's rook\nc) g2g7 - defends the rook while attacking White's rook\nd) g2b7 - attacks the passed b-pawn\n5. Analysis:\n- h8g7 leads to Rxg7 Qxg7, but White still has strong pieces\n- g2a8 looks tempting but after Qa8xg8, Qe6xg8 and White is still better\n- g2g7 seems best: after Rg7xg7 Qxg7, Black's queen is very active and can create counterplay against White's king\n- g2b7 allows White to play Rg7xg8 winning the rook\n6. Best move:\ng2g7 maintains material balance and keeps Black's queen active. After Rg7xg7 Qxg7, Black can look to create threats against White's king while keeping an eye on the b-pawn.\n```\ng2g7\n```"
