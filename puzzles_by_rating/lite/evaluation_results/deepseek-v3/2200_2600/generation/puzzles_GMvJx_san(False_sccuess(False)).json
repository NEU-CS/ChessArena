When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has 2 pawns (a3, b4) + king\n   - Black has 3 pawns (a6, b5, g5) + king\n   - Black is up one pawn\n2. Key observations:\n   - Black's king is very active (f4)\n   - White's pawns are somewhat vulnerable\n   - The h-pawn is White's best chance for promotion\n   - Black's g-pawn is dangerous as it's further advanced\n3. Evaluating candidate moves:\n   - f2g2: Keeps king central but doesn't make progress\n   - f2e2: Similar to g2, not improving position\n   - f2g1/f2f1/f2e1: Retreating king seems passive\n   - a3a4: This would trade pawns (b5xa4) but leaves White with only one pawn\n   - h2h3: Advances the h-pawn but only one square\n   - h2h4: More aggressive pawn push\n4. Best plan:\n   - We need to activate our h-pawn as it's our best chance\n   - h2h4 immediately challenges Black's g5 pawn\n   - After h2h4 g5xh4, we can bring king to h3 to support the pawn\n   - This creates counterplay and drawing chances\n5. Why other moves are worse:\n   - King moves don't make progress\n   - a3a4 simplifies to a lost pawn endgame\n   - h2h3 is too slow\nThe best move is h2h4, creating immediate counterplay with the h-pawn and forcing Black to make decisions about the pawn structure. This gives White the best practical chances to hold the position.\n```\nh2h4\n```"
