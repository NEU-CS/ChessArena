When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n   - White has a rook on c5, pawns on c4, g4, h4, a2, b2\n   - Black has a rook on e2, pawns on a7, h7, c6, d4\n   - White king is on g2, black king on g8\n   - It's White's move (w in FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n   - Black's rook is actively placed on e2, attacking White's pawn on b2\n   - White's rook on c5 is well placed, controlling the 5th rank\n   - Black has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n   - White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n   - g2h3: Moves king towards the h-file, away from center but safer from checks\n   - g2g3: Keeps king centralized but more exposed\n   - g2f3: Moves king towards center but closer to black rook's influence\n   - g2h1: Retreats king to corner, too passive\n   - g2g1: Retreats king, very passive\n   - g2f1: Moves king towards center but still somewhat passive\n4. Best choice considerations:\n   - We need to protect the b2 pawn while keeping the king safe\n   - g2h3 seems best as it:\n     * Moves king away from potential checks along the e-file\n     * Keeps options to move to h4 later if needed\n     * Doesn't expose the king to new threats\n   - Other moves either expose the king more or are too passive\n5. Potential future plans:\n   - After g2h3, White can consider pushing h5 to create passed pawn\n   - Or activate the rook further along the 5th rank\n   - The king is safer on h3 than other squares\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\ng2h3\n```"
