When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is up one pawn, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n2. **Pawn Structure**:\n   - White has pawns at b4, h3, g3 and a2\n   - Black has pawns at a7, b5, g5, h5\n3. **King Position**:\n   - White king is actively placed at d5\n   - Black king is at f5\n4. **Key Observations**:\n   - The position is a race between White's passed a-pawn and Black's connected g/h pawns\n   - White's b4 pawn is blocking Black's b5 pawn\n   - Black's a-pawn is currently blocked by White's a2 pawn\n5. **Candidate Moves Analysis**:\n   - **d5d6**: Advances king but doesn't help with pawn promotion\n   - **d5c6**: King moves toward queenside to support a-pawn\n   - **d5c5**: Similar to c6 but less aggressive\n   - **d5d4**: Retreats king, not helpful\n   - **h3h4**: Challenges Black's g5 pawn, but opens h-file\n   - **g3g4**: Creates passed pawn but allows Black to capture (fxg4)\n   - **a2a3**: Prepares a4 to challenge b5 pawn\n   - **a2a4**: Immediate challenge to b5 pawn\n6. **Best Move**:\n   - **a2a4** is strongest because:\n     * It immediately challenges Black's b5 pawn\n     * After bxa4, bxa4, White gets a passed a-pawn\n     * White's king is well-placed to support the a-pawn's advance\n     * Black's king is too far to stop the a-pawn\n     * Even if Black doesn't take (bxa4), White gains space and activity\n7. **Alternative Moves**:\n   - a2a3 is also good but slower\n   - King moves don't address the main strategic need (creating a passed pawn)\n   - Pawn moves on kingside are risky as they give Black counterplay\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - a2a4 creates immediate pressure and forces Black to make concessions\n   - It's the most direct path to creating a winning passed pawn\n```\na2a4\n```"
