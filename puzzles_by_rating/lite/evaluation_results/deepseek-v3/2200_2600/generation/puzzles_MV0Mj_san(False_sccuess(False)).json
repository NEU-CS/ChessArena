When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has king, bishop, knight and pawn\n- White has king, rook and two pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (rook vs bishop+knight, but black has an extra pawn)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on d8\n- White's rook is very active on h5\n- White's king is centralized on e4\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4 that could be dangerous\n- Black's bishop is blocked by its own pawn on c6\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Rh8+ or Rxb4\n- Black needs to protect the king while advancing the passed pawn\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8e8 (king moves away from potential checks)\n- e2f4 (knight moves to attack white king)\n- b4b3 (advancing the passed pawn)\n- d6e5 (bishop moves to more active position)\n5. Analysis of best options:\n- d8e8 looks safe but passive\n- e2f4 attacks the white king but allows Rh8+ forcing the king to f7\n- b4b3 is tempting but after Rxb3, black loses the passed pawn\n- d6e5 is interesting as it opens the diagonal towards white's king\n6. Best move seems d6e5 because:\n- It activates the bishop\n- Creates potential threats against white's king\n- Maintains the passed pawn\n- After Rh8+, black can play Ke7 and the position remains balanced\nThe move d6e5 seems most principled, activating the bishop while maintaining all options. Other moves either don't improve the position or risk losing material.\n```\nd6e5\n```"
