When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: Queen, 4 pawns\n- Black: Queen, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on f2\n- Black king is on f7, also somewhat exposed\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's queen is on g6, attacking White's queen on h5\n- White's queen has several options, including checks\n- Black's pawn structure is more compromised with doubled pawns\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h5h7+ - Immediate check, forcing the black king to move\nb) h5g6 - Queen trade, but this might be premature\nc) b4b5 - Pushing the passed pawn\nd) f2e3 - Moving the king to safety\n5. Analysis of h5h7+:\n- After h5h7+, black must move the king:\n  - If Kf7-e7, then Qh7-g7+ wins the g6 queen\n  - If Kf7-f8, then Qh7-g7 threatens mate on g8\n  - If Kf7-e8, then Qh7-g7+ wins the queen\n6. Other moves:\n- b4b5 is tempting but allows Qg6xh5\n- h5g6 trades queens but leaves White with no active play\n- King moves don't address the immediate tactical opportunity\n7. Conclusion:\nh5h7+ is a forcing move that either wins the black queen or leads to mate. This is clearly the best move in the position.\n```\nh5h7\n```"
