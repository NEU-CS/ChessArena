When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- White has a pawn on e5 and d4, knight on f4, rook on g3, bishop on f1, queen on d1, king on e1\n- Black has pawns on a7,b7,c7,f7, knight on g6, bishop on g4 and h4, queen on d8, king on e8\n- White has castling rights (Qq) but both sides have developed pieces\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning our knight to the queen\n- Black has a strong bishop pair and active pieces\n- Our e5 pawn is passed and could be dangerous\n- Our rook on g3 is well placed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4g6: Capturing the knight with our knight\n- f1h3: Trading off the dangerous bishop on g4\n- d1g4: Offering queen trade to relieve pressure\n- e5e6: Pushing the passed pawn\n4. Evaluating f4g6:\n- After Nxg6 hxg6, we remove a defender of black's king\n- But black can play Bxg3 fxg3, opening the f-file\n- Black's bishop pair remains strong\n5. Evaluating f1h3:\n- Bxh3 Rxh3, we trade bishops but lose the rook\n- Not ideal as we lose material\n6. Evaluating d1g4:\n- Qxg4 Bxg4, we trade queens but black keeps bishop pair\n- Position remains roughly equal\n7. Evaluating e5e6:\n- Very strong move! Pushes the passed pawn\n- Threatens e7 next move which would be devastating\n- Black has no good way to stop this\n- If ...fxe6, then dxe6 and the pawn is even stronger\n- If ...Bxe6, then Nxe6 fxe6, dxe6 and the pawn is unstoppable\n8. Other moves don't seem as forcing or advantageous.\nConclusion: e5e6 is the strongest move, creating immediate threats that black cannot handle easily while maintaining our positional advantages.\n```\ne5e6\n```"
