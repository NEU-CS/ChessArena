When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook, Knight, 5 pawns\n- White has: Knight, Rook, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black might be slightly better with the extra pawn)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed g-pawn that's advanced to g5\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on c6\n- White's knight on f6 is very active\n- Black's rook on h8 is currently passive\n- Black has a knight on e3 that's well-placed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Rook moves (h8g8/f8/e8 etc.) - activating the rook\nb) King moves (c6c7/b7/d6) - improving king safety\nc) Knight moves (e3d5/g4 etc.) - looking for tactics\nd) Pawn moves (e5e4/c5c4/b5b4) - advancing pawns\n4. Analysis of best options:\n- e3d5 looks tempting to attack the f6 knight, but after Nxd5, cxd5 would leave Black's pawn structure weak\n- e3g4 threatens to fork on f2, but White's rook covers f2\n- c6c7 seems safe but doesn't accomplish much\n- h8g8 is interesting to challenge White's control of the g-file and potentially support the g-pawn's advance\n5. Best move appears to be h8g8 because:\n- Activates the rook to a more central position\n- Puts pressure on White's g-pawn\n- Prepares potential rook swings to the queenside if needed\n- Maintains flexibility for other pieces\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\nThe other moves either don't improve Black's position or create weaknesses. Activating the rook is the most principled move here.\n```\nh8g8\n```"
