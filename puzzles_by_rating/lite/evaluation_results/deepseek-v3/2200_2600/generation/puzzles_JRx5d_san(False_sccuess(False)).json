When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (d7), Rook (e5), Bishop (g3), pawns (a3, b2)\n- Black has: Rook (c8), Bishop (b6), pawns (a7, g4, f3, f2), King (f8)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed and under pressure\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on f2\n- White has two rooks on the 7th rank\n- Black's bishop on b6 is very active\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Black's f2 pawn queening\n- White needs to either stop this or create counterplay\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5e8+ (rook check) - forces the king to move, but doesn't stop f2 pawn\n- d7d8 (queening threat) - but Black can take with rook\n- g3h2 (capturing f2 pawn) - removes the immediate threat\n- e5e7 (doubling rooks on 7th rank) - maintains pressure\n5. Analysis of g3h2:\n- Takes the dangerous pawn\n- After g3h2, if Black takes with f2g3, then b2g3 opens the b-file\n- White can then play d7d8 next move with threats\n6. Analysis of e5e8+:\n- Forces king to g7\n- Then d7d8 is met with c8d8\n- White can play e8d8, but Black has f2f1Q coming\n7. Analysis of d7d8:\n- Black plays c8d8\n- e5d5+ forks king and rook, but Black can play f8e7\n- Then d5d8, but Black promotes f2f1Q\nAfter careful consideration, g3h2 is the best move as it:\n- Removes the immediate threat of promotion\n- Opens possibilities for White's rooks to create threats\n- Maintains material balance\n- Keeps the initiative\nThe other moves either allow Black to promote or don't address the immediate danger.\n```\ng3h2\n```"
