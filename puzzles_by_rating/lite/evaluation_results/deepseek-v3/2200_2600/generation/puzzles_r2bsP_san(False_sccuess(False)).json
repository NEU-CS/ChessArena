When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, 2 pawns vs Black's queen, 2 rooks, 3 pawns. Material is roughly equal (Black has slight edge with extra rook but White's pieces are more active).\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d5\n- Black's king is exposed on h7\n- White has connected passed pawns on b3/a3 that could become dangerous\n- Black has doubled rooks on the e-file\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5g8: Queen sacrifice to expose the king\n- d5f7: Threatening the rook while attacking f5 pawn\n- f1f5: Rook sacrifice to open lines\n- Developing the passed pawns (b3b4 or a3a4)\n4. Calculating d5g8:\n- d5g8+ rxg8\n- f1f7! (threatening mate on h7)\n- If qxf7, then rf1+ winning the queen\n- If black tries other moves, white gets strong attack\n5. Other moves:\n- d5f7 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Pawn pushes are too slow given black's attacking potential\n- Other queen moves don't create immediate threats\nThe queen sacrifice d5g8 leads to a forced win after precise follow-up. The key line is:\n1. d5g8+ rxg8\n2. f1f7! qxf7 (forced, else mate on h7)\n3. rf1+ qf5\n4. rxf5 and white wins material\nThis is the most forcing and decisive continuation. The other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow black to consolidate.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd5g8\n```"
