When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, R, B, N, 5 pawns\n- Black has: Q, R, R, B, N, 5 pawns\nMaterial is equal, but White has better piece coordination.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's bishop on a6 is very strong, pinning the b7 pawn to the king\n- Black's queen on h4 is threatening, but White's king has some protection\n- White's knight on d4 is centralized and strong\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) a6b7 - capturing the pawn and maintaining the pin\nb) d4e6 - fork of queen and bishop\nc) a4e8 - queen sacrifice to expose the king\nd) c1c7 - rook lift to attack\n4. Analysis of best options:\n- a6b7 looks very strong:\n  * Captures a pawn while maintaining pin\n  * If ...Kxb7, then Qa6+ wins the rook on g8\n  * If ...Rxb7, then Qa8+ wins the rook on g8\n  * Black has no good way to defend this\n- d4e6 is tempting but after ...fxe6, dxe6 Qxe6, White doesn't have enough compensation for the knight\n- a4e8 is flashy but after ...Rxe8, White doesn't have enough follow-up\n- c1c7 is interesting but doesn't immediately win material like a6b7\n5. Conclusion:\na6b7 is the most forcing move that wins material immediately while maintaining all of White's positional advantages. Black has no good way to defend against the threats that follow.\n```\na6b7\n```"
