When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: King, Queen, Bishop, 2 pawns\n- Black: King, Bishop, Knight, 2 pawns, Queen\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has Q vs B+N, but Black has an extra pawn)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on b2, threatening mate on g2\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black has a passed pawn on b6\n- White has a passed pawn on a4\n- White's bishop on h3 is very active\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black threatens Qxg2# if not addressed\n- White needs to defend against this while maintaining counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Defensive options:\n- h2h1 (promotes to queen) - but this allows Qxg2+ followed by Qxh1\n- f1g1 - blocks the mate but loses the queen to Qxg1+\n- f1f2 - blocks the mate but allows Qxf2+\nb) Counterattacking options:\n- h3c8 - bishop sacrifice to deflect black king\n- f1f7 - threatens mate in 1 (Qxg7#)\n- f1a6 - pins the b6 pawn to the king\n5. Analysis of f1f7:\n- If Qxg7#, black can't take back (king is in check)\n- Black's only defense is Qxf7, but then h3c8+ wins the queen\n- After 36. Qf7 Qxf7 37. Bc8+ K moves 38. Bxf7, white is up material\n6. Analysis of h3c8:\n- Immediate deflection sacrifice\n- If 36. Bc8+ Kxc8 37. Qf8+ Kd7 38. Qxb2, white wins the queen\n- But black can play 36...Kh7 instead, and white's position remains dangerous\n7. Best move:\nQf7 is the most forcing and decisive move, leading to immediate material gain.\n```\nf1f7\n```"
