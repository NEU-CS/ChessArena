When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black should use the rook to stop it.\n   - The move **c2a2** places the rook on the a-file to block the pawn.\n   - After c2a2, White would likely play a6a7, then Black can play Ra8, completely stopping the pawn.\n   - Meanwhile, Black can then push the d-pawn or bring the king closer.\n5. **Why not other rook moves?**\n   - Moving the rook elsewhere doesn't address the a-pawn threat.\n   - Moving the king allows White to push the a-pawn faster.\n6. **Why not d4d3?**\n   - After 1...d4d3 2.Kxd3, Black's pawn is gone and White's king becomes more active.\n**Conclusion**: The best move is to block the passed a-pawn immediately with the rook.\n```\nc2a2\n```"
