When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Evaluation**: \n   - Black has queen, rook, bishop vs White's queen, rook, bishop, knight. Material is roughly equal (Black is down a minor piece but has compensation).\n2. **Positional Factors**:\n   - Black's queen is very active on b4, attacking f8 and potentially threatening White's king.\n   - White's knight on e4 is strong but currently not threatening anything immediate.\n   - Black's rook on h8 is passive, while White's rook on c1 is active.\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed on e8.\n3. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **b4e7**: Queen checks the king, forcing it to move. This looks promising as it activates the queen and forces White to react.\n   - **h8g8**: Developing the rook to a more active position.\n   - **f8g7**: Protecting the bishop but seems passive.\n   - **b4d2**: Threatening the pawn on f2, but White can defend with Qe2.\n4. **Analyzing b4e7**:\n   - After b4e7+, White has to move the king (only legal move is Kg1-h2).\n   - Then we can follow up with h8g8, activating the rook with tempo on the g4 pawn.\n   - This sequence improves Black's piece activity significantly.\n5. **Other moves**:\n   - Most other moves either don't improve our position or allow White to consolidate.\n   - The immediate rook activation (h8g8) is good but doesn't create immediate threats like b4e7 does.\n6. **Potential Threats**:\n   - After b4e7+ Kh2, we can consider moves like Rg8 attacking g4, or even Qd6 threatening to infiltrate.\n   - White's pieces would be somewhat tied down defending.\n**Conclusion**: b4e7 is the most forcing and active move, creating immediate threats while improving our queen's position. It leads to a favorable sequence where we can activate our rook with tempo.\n```\nb4e7\n```"
