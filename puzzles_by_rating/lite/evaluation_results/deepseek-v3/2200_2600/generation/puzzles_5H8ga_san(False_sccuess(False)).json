When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the material balance:\n   - White has: Bishop (d5), Bishop (b2), Queen (d2), pawns (a3, b3, c4, g3, h2)\n   - Black has: Rook (d8), Queen (d7), Bishop (g4), pawns (b7, d6, f6, g6, h7)\n   - Material is roughly equal (White has 3 minor pieces vs Black's 2, but Black has an extra pawn)\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling important squares\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n   - White's pawn structure is slightly better with passed pawn potential on queenside\n   - Black's bishop on g4 is pinned to the queen (if it moves, Qxg4)\n3. Evaluating the candidate moves:\n   - g8h8/g8f8: King moves don't accomplish much and leave the bishop hanging\n   - g8g7: Gets the king off the back rank but doesn't solve the bishop issue\n   - d7f7: Queen moves to defend the bishop, but allows Qxg4 anyway after Bxg4\n   - d7e6: Interesting - threatens to take the strong bishop on d5\n   - g4e6: Counterattacks the bishop while developing the bishop\n4. Best move analysis:\n   - g4e6 is the most forcing move:\n     * Attacks the strong bishop on d5\n     * If Bxe6, then Qxe6 and Black's queen becomes very active\n     * If White doesn't take, Black can consider ...Qe6 next move\n     * Maintains the pin on the d2 queen\n   - d7e6 is also interesting but after Bxe6 Qxe6, White can play Qxg4\n5. Conclusion:\n   - g4e6 is the most active move, forcing White to make a decision about the bishop\n   - It maintains pressure and doesn't allow White to consolidate\n   - Other moves either don't address the bishop issue or allow White to win material\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng4e6\n```"
