When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: queen, rook, bishop, knight, 3 pawns\n- White has: queen, 2 rooks, bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black might be slightly better with bishop pair)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7\n- White has pressure on the f-file with rook on f5\n- Black's queen is under attack from White's rook on f5\n- Black's knight on d3 is well-placed but could be challenged\n- White's pawn structure is slightly better\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: Need to get the queen to safety while maintaining activity\n- Knight moves: d3e5 looks interesting, attacking f3 and c4 squares\n- Rook moves: d7f7 could challenge White's rook\n- King moves: g7g6 improves king safety\n4. Evaluating best options:\n- d8e7 seems passive and blocks the bishop\n- d8f6 looks interesting, keeping the queen active\n- d3e5 is tempting but after Bxe5, dxe5, White's rook becomes very strong\n- d7f7 is worth considering to challenge the rook\n- g7g6 improves king safety but might be too passive\n5. Best choice:\nd7f7 seems most principled:\n- Challenges White's active rook\n- Maintains control of the 7th rank\n- Doesn't weaken Black's position\n- After Rxf7, Qxf7 maintains material balance while improving queen's activity\nOther options either lose material or allow White to maintain pressure.\n```\nd7f7\n```"
