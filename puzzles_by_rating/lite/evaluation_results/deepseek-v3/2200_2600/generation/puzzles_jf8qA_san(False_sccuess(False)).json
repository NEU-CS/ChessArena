When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (Black has king + bishop vs White's king + bishop)\n2. Black's king is at g3, White's king at b6\n3. Black has a passed pawn at c5 and White has a passed pawn at a5\n4. White's bishop is on e2, Black's bishop on g2\n5. Black has pawns at f4 and g5; White has pawns at a5, c4, f3\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g3h4 - King moves towards White's pawns\n2. g2h3 - Bishop moves to h3, attacking f1 square\n3. g5g4 - Pushing the g-pawn\nAnalysis:\n- g5g4 seems tempting to create a passed pawn, but after fxg4, White gets counterplay with his a-pawn\n- g2h3 looks interesting to control more squares, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- g3h4 is the most active move, bringing the king closer to White's pawns and potentially supporting the f4 pawn\nBest move is g3h4 because:\n1. It centralizes the king\n2. Prepares to support the f4 pawn (next move could be h4g4)\n3. Limits White's king mobility\n4. Keeps options open for both kingside and queenside play\n5. Maintains the bishop's strong position on g2\nOther moves either don't improve the position or allow White counterplay. The king move is most flexible and active.\n```\ng3h4\n```"
