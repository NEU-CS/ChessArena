If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully. Here's the FEN: `8/2k5/4pp2/1PK4p/5P1P/8/8/8 b - - 3 37`\nFirst, let's visualize the board:\n- Black king at c7\n- White king at b5, pawn at c5\n- Black pawns at f6, e6, h5\n- White pawns at f4, h4\nKey observations:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have king + 3 pawns)\n2. White has a passed pawn at c5 that's quite advanced\n3. Black's pawn structure is more flexible with pawns on both sides\n4. White's king is more active (b5 vs black's c7)\nNow let's evaluate the candidate moves:\n1. King moves:\n   - c7d8/c7c8/c7b8: Moving the king away from the center seems passive\n   - c7d7: Keeps the king centralized but doesn't address the c5 pawn\n   - c7b7: Best king move - heads towards the dangerous c5 pawn\n2. Pawn moves:\n   - f6f5: Creates a passed pawn but weakens e6\n   - e6e5: Creates a passed pawn but blocks the king's path to c5\nThe most critical factor is stopping White's c-pawn. The move c7b7:\n- Directly opposes the c5 pawn\n- Prepares to capture it if White pushes c6\n- Maintains king activity\nOther moves either don't address the c-pawn or create weaknesses. For example:\n- e6e5 would allow White to play c6 and then Kb6, winning the e5 pawn\n- f6f5 weakens e6 and doesn't help stop the c-pawn\nTherefore, the best move is to bring the king towards the passed pawn with:\n```\nc7b7\n```"
