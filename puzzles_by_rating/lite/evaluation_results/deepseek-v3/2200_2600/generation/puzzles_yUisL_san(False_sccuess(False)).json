When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n- Black has: rook (a8), knight (e7), rook (e6), queen (e5), pawn (a6)\n- White has: rook (d4), queen (f3), pawns (c3,a2,f2,h2), king (d2), rook (h1)\n- Material is roughly equal (Black has queen vs White's queen + rook, but Black has extra rook)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- White has threats like Qf3xc6+ or Rd4-c4+\n- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n- The e5 queen is under attack from White's rook on d4\n3. Evaluating candidate moves:\n- c6c7: Moves king away but into potential danger from White's rooks\n- c6b6: Moves king sideways but still exposed\n- c6c5: Moves king forward but into more danger\n- c6b5: Moves king away but still vulnerable\n- e7d5: Knight move that blocks the queen's attack\n- e5d5: Queen moves to defend against Rd4 but blocks the e-file\n- e5e4: Queen moves forward, maintaining pressure\n4. Best options seem to be:\n- e5d5: Protects against Rd4 threats while keeping queen active\n- e7d5: Blocks the attack but may lead to complications\n5. After e5d5:\n- White can play Qf3xd5, but then Rook takes: Rxd5\n- This leads to simplification but maintains Black's material advantage\n6. Other moves either expose the king too much or lose material.\nThe best move is to protect the queen while maintaining control of the position. e5d5 achieves this while forcing favorable exchanges.\n```\ne5d5\n```"
