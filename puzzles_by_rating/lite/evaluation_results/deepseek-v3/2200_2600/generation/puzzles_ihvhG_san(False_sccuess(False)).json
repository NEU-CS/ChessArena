When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (both have minor pieces and rooks, no major imbalances)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on d5 (very strong centralized knight)\n- Black has a pawn on g3 attacking white's f2 square\n- Black's king is still uncastled (though has castling rights)\n- White's king is castled kingside\n- Black has a knight on c5 and bishop on c8\n3. Threats:\n- Black's g3 pawn is threatening to take on f2 (discovered check if the bishop moves)\n- White has potential threats against Black's uncastled king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7+ (forking king and rook)\n- e2h5 (developing with tempo against f7)\n- f1f7 (rook lift with attacking potential)\n- d5c7 (attacking the queen)\n5. Deep analysis of best options:\n- d5e7+ looks very strong: \n  * Forces the king to move (likely Ke7)\n  * Then Qd6+ would be crushing, winning the knight on c5\n  * Even if Black tries Kf8, white has strong follow-ups\n- e2h5 is interesting but Black can defend with g6\n- f1f7 is tempting but Black can defend with Qe7\n- d5c7 is good but not as forcing as d5e7+\n6. Conclusion: d5e7+ is the most forcing and strongest move, leading to immediate material gain and exposing Black's king.\n```\nd5e7\n```"
