When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (2 pawns each)\n2. Black's pawn on c4 is passed and very dangerous\n3. White's pawn on b2 can become dangerous if advanced\n4. White's king is somewhat restricted\nLooking at the candidate moves:\n1. a4b5 - King moves toward black's pawn, but leaves c4 pawn free to advance\n2. a4a5 - King moves away from action, not helpful\n3. a4b4 - King blocks the c-pawn, but then black can play Kd4 attacking our pawn\n4. a4a3 - King retreats, but allows black to push c4-c3\n5. b2b3 - This blocks the c-pawn with our pawn, but after Kd4 we lose the pawn\n6. b2b4 - This creates a passed pawn and challenges black's c-pawn\nThe best move is b2b4 because:\n- It creates a passed pawn on b4\n- It challenges black's c4 pawn (if ...cxb3, then cxb3 and we have a passed b-pawn)\n- If black doesn't take, we can push b4-b5 next\n- It maintains flexibility for our king to maneuver\nOther moves either allow black's c-pawn to advance or don't create counterplay. The pawn push gives us the best chance to create winning chances or at least maintain balance.\n```\nb2b4\n```"
