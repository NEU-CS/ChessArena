When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (both sides have pawns only)\n2. Black's king is more active (on a6) vs White's king on d3\n3. Black has a passed pawn on b4, White has a passed pawn on c4\n4. White's pawn structure is more solid with pawns on f3, g4, h3\n5. Black has some weaknesses: e6 pawn is backward, f5 pawn is potentially weak\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. a6b7 - King moves toward center and potential passed pawns\n2. a6a7 - King moves toward potential promotion square but less active\n3. f5f4 - Creates a passed pawn but opens up the king\n4. e5e4 - Pawn break, but after fxe4 the f5 pawn becomes weak\n5. h5h4 - Fixes White's h-pawn but gives up the h5 square\nBest move analysis:\n- a6b7 is strong as it centralizes the king toward both wings and prepares to support the b4 pawn's advance. The king can then go to c6 to support both b4 and e6 pawns.\n- f5f4 looks tempting but after gxf4, White gets a protected passed pawn on f4 and Black's e6 pawn becomes very weak.\n- e5e4 is risky as after fxe4, Black's f5 pawn is isolated and weak.\n- h5h4 is too committal and doesn't improve Black's position significantly.\nThe most solid and strategically sound move is a6b7, improving the king's position to support both wings.\n```\na6b7\n```"
