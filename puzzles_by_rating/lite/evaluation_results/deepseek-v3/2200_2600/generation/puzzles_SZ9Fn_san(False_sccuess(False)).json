When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material: Black has queen, bishop vs White's queen, knight. Material is roughly equal but Black's pieces are more active.\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h6, White's on g2.\n3. Threats: White's queen on f6 is very active, eyeing h6 (king) and f7 (pawn).\n4. Black's queen on g4 is centralized but needs to be careful about White's threats.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g4f4 - attacks White's queen while maintaining pressure\n2. g4h4 - threatens mate on h2\n3. d4f2 - forks king and pawn\n4. e5e4 - pawn push, but opens lines\n5. h5h4 - pawn push, but might weaken king\nLet's evaluate g4h4 (threatening Qh2#):\n- White must respond to the mate threat\n- Possible responses:\n  - Qh4 (but Qxh4 loses to Qh2#)\n  - g3 (but Qxg3+ Kf1 Qh3+ Ke2 Qxh2+ wins)\n  - Other moves like Kg1 allow Qh2#\nThis seems very strong. Let's check if White has any defenses:\nAfter g4h4:\n- If Qxh4, then Qh2#\n- If g3, then Qxg3+ Kf1 Qh3+ Ke2 Qxh2+ and Black wins\n- If Kg1, then Qh2# is coming\n- If Qg5+, Kh7 and Black is winning\nNow let's check d4f2:\n- This forks king and pawn\n- But after Kxf2, Qxg3+ Ke2 Qxh2+ and Black is winning material\n- However, White can play Qxf7 with counterplay\ng4h4 seems more forcing and decisive.\nOther moves like g4f4 allow Qxf4 exf4 and the position becomes unclear.\nConclusion: g4h4 creates an immediate and unstoppable mate threat that wins material or leads to checkmate.\n```\ng4h4\n```"
