When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and pawn structure:\n- Both sides have only kings and pawns remaining\n- Black has pawns on b5, c5, f6, h6\n- White has pawns on a4, b3, f3, g4, f5\n- White's king is on e4, Black's king is on b6\n2. Key observations:\n- This is a pure pawn endgame where king activity is crucial\n- White has a passed pawn on f5 that's already quite advanced\n- Black's pawns are mostly blocked or restrained:\n  - f6 blocks f5\n  - b5 is restrained by a4\n  - c5 is restrained by b3\n  - h6 is restrained by g4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6c7: Centralizing the king\n- b6b7: Moving toward the queenside\n- b5b4: Trying to create counterplay\n- h6h5: Trying to create a passed pawn\n4. Evaluating the best move:\n- b5b4 would be met with a4xb5, opening lines for White's king\n- h6h5 g4xh5 creates a passed h-pawn but White's king is closer\n- b6b7 is too passive and allows White's king to penetrate\n- b6c7 is the most active, centralizing the king to both defend and attack\n5. Why b6c7 is best:\n- Prepares to bring the king toward the center and kingside\n- Can potentially support ...c5c4 in the future\n- Keeps options open to defend against White's pawn advances\n- Maintains flexibility in the position\n6. Other moves would either be too passive or create weaknesses.\nThe best move is:\n```\nb6c7\n```"
