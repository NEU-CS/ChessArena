When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, bishop, 3 pawns\n- White has: king, bishop, pawn, passed pawn on e5\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has a dangerous passed pawn.\n2. Key features:\n- White's e5 pawn is very strong and well-supported.\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed.\n- Black's pawn structure is compromised with doubled pawns on d-file.\n- White's king is more active.\n3. Candidate moves evaluation:\n- f8g7: Moves bishop to defend king, but doesn't address e5 pawn threat.\n- f8e7: Attacks e5 pawn, but White can defend with f5-f6.\n- f8d6: Attacks e5 pawn, but White can push f5-f6.\n- f8c5: Doesn't seem productive.\n- f8b4: Too passive.\n- f8a3: Doesn't help.\n- f7g8: Retreats king, but gives up control.\n- f7e8: Similar to g8, not ideal.\n- f7e7: Puts king on same file as White's bishop, risky.\n- c6c5: Creates a passed pawn but opens lines for White.\n- g5g4: Creates counterplay by advancing pawn.\n4. Best option:\ng5g4 seems most principled because:\n- Creates immediate counterplay\n- Threatens to advance the pawn further\n- Potentially creates a passed pawn\n- Doesn't allow White to consolidate\n- Keeps the bishop's options open\nOther moves either don't address the position's needs or are too passive. While moving the bishop to attack the e5 pawn seems logical, White can always defend it with f5-f6, maintaining the strong passed pawn. Creating our own passed pawn with g5g4 is the most dynamic choice.\n```\ng5g4\n```"
