When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Evaluation**: \n   - Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, 2 knights, bishop and pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal (Black has Q+R+B+N vs White's Q+R+2N+B)\n2. **Positional Factors**:\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed on d8\n   - White has pressure on the dark squares (especially with the knight on c5)\n   - Black's bishop on e7 is passive\n   - Black's queen on c7 is well placed\n   - Black has a strong knight on g4 attacking f2\n3. **Threats**:\n   - White's knight on c5 is threatening to jump to d7 or e6\n   - White's queen on c3 is eyeing the g7 square\n   - Black's knight on g4 is threatening f2, but it's well defended\n4. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **d8h8**: Gets the king to safety but abandons the center\n   - **g4e6**: A strong centralizing move attacking the queen\n   - **c7d7**: Defends against potential Nd7+ while keeping queen active\n   - **f4g6**: Develops the knight but doesn't address immediate threats\n5. **Best Move Analysis**:\n   - g4e6 looks very promising as it:\n     * Attacks the white queen\n     * Centralizes the knight\n     * Prepares to bring the rook into play via d8-d7\n     * After Qxe6, Bxe6 gives Black the bishop pair and opens the d-file\n6. **Potential Line**:\n   - g4e6 Qxe6 Bxe6\n   - Now Black has the bishop pair and can follow up with Rd7 activating the rook\n   - White's knight on c5 is no longer as dangerous without queen support\n7. **Alternative Considerations**:\n   - c7d7 is solid but passive\n   - d8h8 is safe but too passive\n   - Other knight moves don't address the immediate position as well\nAfter careful consideration, **g4e6** is the most active and forcing move that improves Black's position while reducing White's attacking potential.\n```\ng4e6\n```"
