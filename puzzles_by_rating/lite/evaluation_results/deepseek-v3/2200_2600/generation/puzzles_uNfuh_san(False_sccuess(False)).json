When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen + pawns\n- Black has queen + pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is more active\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed but has some pawn cover\n- Black king is exposed with pawn weaknesses around it\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White has connected passed pawns on c4 and e4\n- Black has doubled pawns on the f-file and weaknesses on g5 and h6\n4. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen is attacking White's g2 pawn\n- White's queen has multiple checking options against Black's exposed king\n5. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen checks: h8e8+ looks strong, forcing the king to move\n- Pawn pushes: e4e5 or c4c5 to advance passed pawns\n- King moves: f3g4 to centralize and defend pawns\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h8e8+ is very strong as it forces the black king to move (either to f7 or d7)\n- After h8e8+ kf7, we can play e4e5 with strong threats\n- Other queen checks don't create the same immediate pressure\n- Pawn pushes can wait until after we improve our queen's position\nThe most forcing and strongest move is h8e8+, putting immediate pressure on Black's position while maintaining all our options.\n```\nh8e8\n```"
