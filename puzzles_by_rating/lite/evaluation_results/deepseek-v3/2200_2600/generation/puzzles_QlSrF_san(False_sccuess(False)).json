When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's king is very active and can quickly attack White's pawns.\n2. White's king needs to stay active to defend the pawns.\n3. The pawn structure is locked on the kingside (f4 vs f5, g3 vs g4).\n4. The e6 pawn is backward and could be a target.\nLooking at the legal moves:\n1. d3c3 - King moves away from center, not ideal\n2. d3e2 - King retreats, passive\n3. d3d2 - King retreats further, very passive\n4. d3c2 - King retreats to corner, terrible\n5. e3e4 - King advances, most active\nThe best move is e3e4 because:\n- It centralizes the king\n- It threatens to attack Black's e6 pawn next move\n- It maintains pressure on Black's position\n- It prevents Black's king from advancing further (after e3e4, Black can't play ...ke5)\n- It keeps White's king active in the endgame\nOther moves would allow Black to gain more space and activity with ...ke5, putting pressure on White's position.\n```\ne3e4\n```"
