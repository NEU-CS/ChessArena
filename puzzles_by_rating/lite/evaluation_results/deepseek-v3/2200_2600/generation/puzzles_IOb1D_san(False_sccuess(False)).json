When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has a bishop on f6, pawn on d5, queen on d2, etc.\n- Black has a bishop on c8, knight on b6, queen on d8, etc.\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has a strong passed pawn on d5.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's bishop on f6 is very strong, controlling important squares and pinning the e7 pawn.\n- Black's king is still in the center (castled kingside but rook is on f8).\n- White has pressure on the d-file with queen and rook.\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qd6, putting pressure on f6 and threatening to win material.\n- The d5 pawn is strong and may advance further.\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c8f5 - Developing the bishop to an active square, attacking d3.\n- e7g6 - Trying to remove the strong f6 bishop.\n- b6d5 - Challenging the strong d5 pawn.\n- d8d7 - Connecting rooks and defending the knight.\n5. Evaluating best options:\n- c8f5 looks tempting, but after Bxf5 exf5, White's pawn structure improves.\n- e7g6 Bxg6 hxg6 opens the h-file but weakens Black's king.\n- b6d5 seems most principled, directly challenging White's strong pawn.\nAfter b6d5:\n- If White takes: dxc6 Qxc6 and Black has active pieces.\n- If White doesn't take, Black can reinforce with ...Nc7 or ...Bf5.\nThis seems like the most active way to handle the position, preventing White from consolidating their pawn advantage.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb6d5\n```"
