When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: King, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: King, Bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black has an extra pawn but White has a knight vs bishop)\n2. Positional factors:\n- White's knight is actively placed on c5\n- Black's bishop is active but could be more active\n- White's pawns are mostly on the queenside, Black's on kingside\n- Both kings are somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: c7d6 looks interesting to centralize the king\n- Bishop moves: g4f5 looks strong to increase bishop's activity\n- Pawn moves: g7g5 could be considered to create passed pawn\n4. Evaluating g4f5:\n- Attacks the knight on c5\n- If knight moves, we can play ...f5-f4 attacking the white king\n- Opens potential for ...f5-e4 later\n- Keeps pressure on white's position\n5. Other options:\n- c7d6 is solid but doesn't create threats\n- g7g5 weakens the pawn structure\n- e6e5 allows white to play Nxe6+\n6. Potential lines after g4f5:\n- If 1...g4f5 2.Nd3 (protecting b2 pawn) then 2...f4! attacking king\n- If 2.Nb7 then 2...Bd7 trapping the knight\n- If 2.Na4 then 2...f4 with strong initiative\n7. Conclusion:\ng4f5 is the most active move, increasing bishop's scope and creating threats against white's position. It maintains the initiative and puts pressure on white to find accurate moves.\nThe best move is:\n```\ng4f5\n```"
