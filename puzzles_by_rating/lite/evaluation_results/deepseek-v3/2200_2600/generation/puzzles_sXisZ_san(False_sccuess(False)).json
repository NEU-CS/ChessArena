When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has Rook, 2 Knights, Pawn, Queen, Rook\n- Black has Rook, Pawn, Pawn, Queen, Knight, Bishop, Rook\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has better piece coordination.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g5 is very active\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black has threats against White's king (e.g. Qh4+ ideas)\n- White's rooks are active on the c-file and e-file\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) c7c8 - promoting the rook to queen would be strong, but it's not possible (pawn is still on f7)\nb) c7f7 - attacking the f7 pawn and pinning it to the king\nc) b5d6 - knight fork attacking queen and bishop\nd) e1e3 - defending the f3 pawn and connecting rooks\n4. Evaluating c7f7:\n- Pins the f7 pawn to the king\n- If Black takes with Qxf7, then Nxd6 forks queen and bishop\n- If Black doesn't take, White can pile up on f7\n- This seems very strong\n5. Evaluating b5d6:\n- Immediate knight fork\n- Black would likely play Qxd5\n- Then Nxe3, but Black has Qxd1\n- Not as strong as it first appears\n6. Evaluating e1e3:\n- Solid but not as forcing\n- Doesn't create immediate threats\nAfter careful consideration, c7f7 is the strongest move:\n- It creates immediate threats\n- The pin is very uncomfortable for Black\n- Leads to potential material gain\n- Maintains White's initiative\nHere's the move:\n```\nc7f7\n```"
