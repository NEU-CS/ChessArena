When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's king is centralized while White's is less active\n3. Both sides have passed pawns (White's b5 and g4, Black's d3)\n4. Black's bishop controls the long diagonal\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b3c5 - attacks bishop and pawn, but allows ...Bxc5 bxc5 Kd5 with good play for Black\n2. b3a5 - less active, doesn't create threats\n3. b3d4 - blocks the d-pawn but allows ...exd4\n4. g4g5 - advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n5. d1d2 - centralizes the king towards the action\nBest move appears to be d1d2, centralizing the king to support the pawns and participate in both defense and offense. The king is the best piece to stop Black's passed pawn and support White's own pawns.\n```\nd1d2\n```"
