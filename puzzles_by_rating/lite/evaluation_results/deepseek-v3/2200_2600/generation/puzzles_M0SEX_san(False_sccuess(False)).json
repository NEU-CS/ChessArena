When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (White has R+R vs Black has R+R)\n3. White has two rooks on d5 and f6\n4. Black has rooks on e2 and g2, king on f4, pawn on f5 and h7\n5. White's king is on f1\nThe position is very sharp with both sides having active pieces. Let's evaluate candidate moves:\n1. **King moves**:\n   - f4g5: Moves towards White's rook but exposes to checks\n   - f4g3: Could be interesting to support the rooks\n   - f4f3: Keeps pressure but doesn't improve position\n   - f4e3: Moves towards center but may be risky\n2. **Rook moves**:\n   - g2g8/g7/g6/g5/g4/g3: Various rook lifts\n   - e2 moves: e2e8 looks tempting to attack from behind\n   - g2h2/f2: Lateral moves\n3. **Pawn moves**:\n   - h7h6/h5: Not immediately helpful\nBest candidate moves to consider:\n1. **e2e8**: This looks very strong - it attacks the f6 rook from behind and creates threats of doubling rooks on the e-file or penetrating to the 8th rank. White would have to respond carefully.\n2. **g2g8**: Also interesting, preparing to double rooks on the g-file and potentially create mating threats.\n3. **f4g3**: Improves king safety and supports the rooks.\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- e2e8 is most forcing. After 1...e2e8, White must deal with the threat to the f6 rook. If 2.Rf6e6, then 2...Re8xe6 wins a rook. White would have to play something like 2.Rd5d4, but then Black can continue with strong play.\nOther moves don't create such immediate threats. Therefore, the best move is:\n```\ne2e8\n```"
