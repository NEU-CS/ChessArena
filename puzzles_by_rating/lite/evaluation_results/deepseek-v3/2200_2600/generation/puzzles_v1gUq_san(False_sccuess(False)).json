When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, knight, bishop, queen, rook, 2 pawns\n- White has: king, bishop, queen, rook, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black has minor piece for 2 pawns)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on the dark squares (white bishop on e3 controls important squares)\n- White's king is also exposed with weak pawn structure\n- Black has active pieces (rook on h4, bishop on b2)\n- White's pawn on c5 is passed and dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h4h8 - Rook lift to 8th rank, threatening to invade\nb) b2e5 - Bishop sacrifice to expose white king\nc) f6f4 - Queen move attacking f2 pawn\nd) d7e5 - Knight centralization\n4. Analysis of options:\na) h4h8 looks strong - after 1...h4h8 2.Rd2 Rh1+ 3.Ke2 Qh6! with strong attack\nb) b2e5 is tempting but after 2.Bxe5 Qxe5 3.Qxh3 White defends\nc) f6f4 allows 2.Qxf4 Rxf4 3.Bxf4 and White is better\nd) d7e5 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n5. Best move appears to be h4h8, creating immediate threats against White's king while keeping all pieces active. The rook will be extremely dangerous on the 8th rank, and White's king has no safe squares.\n```\nh4h8\n```"
