When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Pawn (f3, g4), King\n- Black has: Bishop, 3 pawns (b3, g5, h4), King\n- Material is roughly equal, but pawn structure favors Black slightly\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is more active (c4 vs White's g2)\n- Black has connected passed pawns on b3 and h4\n- White's rook is active on the 5th rank\n- Black's bishop controls important squares\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5f8: Rook to the 8th rank, threatening to check the king\n- f5f7: Rook to 7th rank, preparing to attack pawns\n- g2h3: King moves toward Black's passed pawns\n- e5e6: Pawn advance to create a passed pawn\n4. Analysis of best options:\n- f5f8 looks tempting as it checks the king immediately, but after Kd5 the rook doesn't have great follow-up\n- g2h3 is important to stop Black's h-pawn, but we might have time for this later\n- e5e6 creates a passed pawn that could be dangerous, but Black can respond with Bxe6\n- f5f7 is the most flexible, keeping the rook active and preparing to swing to b7 to attack the b3 pawn\n5. Best move:\nf5f7 is the most promising as it:\n- Keeps the rook active and mobile\n- Prepares Rb7 to attack the b3 pawn\n- Maintains control of the 7th rank\n- Doesn't allow Black any immediate counterplay\nAfter f5f7, possible continuations could be Rb7 attacking the b3 pawn, or the king can start moving toward the h-pawn. This maintains maximum flexibility while improving our position.\n```\nf5f7\n```"
