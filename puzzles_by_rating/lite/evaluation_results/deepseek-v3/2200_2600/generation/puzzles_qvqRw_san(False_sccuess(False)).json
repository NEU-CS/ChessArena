When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the material balance:\n- White has: 1 queen, 1 bishop, 1 knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: 1 queen, 2 bishops, 1 knight, 6 pawns\nBlack is up a pawn and has better piece coordination.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed on e1\n- Black's queen is very active on a5\n- Black's dark-squared bishop on h3 is pinning White's knight on b3 to the king\n- White's queen on e3 is defending multiple weak points\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h3g4 - attacking the queen and maintaining the pin\nb) a5c3 - forking the knight and bishop\nc) d7e5 - centralizing the knight with tempo on the queen\n4. Analysis of h3g4:\n- After Qxg4, Nxg4 Bxg4, Black wins the queen for bishop+knight, but this might not be best\n- White can play Qe2 instead, maintaining material equality\n5. Analysis of a5c3:\n- Wins the bishop on b3 after Qxc3 Bxc3\n- But White can play Qxc3 Bxc3 Nxc3, and Black's advantage is minimal\n6. Analysis of d7e5:\n- Attacks the queen on e3\n- Queen must move, and Ne5 is a strong central outpost\n- After Q moves, Black can consider ...Qc3 or ...Bf1 next\n7. Best continuation appears to be d7e5:\n- Forces the queen to move (likely Qe2 or Qf3)\n- Centralizes the knight with tempo\n- Maintains all of Black's positional advantages\n- Keeps pressure on White's position\nThe move d7e5 is the most principled and maintains all of Black's advantages while improving the knight's position. Other moves either don't maximize Black's advantage or allow White some counterplay.\n```\nd7e5\n```"
