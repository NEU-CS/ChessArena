When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with Queen vs Rook+Bishop)\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on c7\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on g4\n- Black's rook on e2 is very active in White's territory\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens to play ...g3, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- Black could also play ...Rxf2, attacking White's pawn structure\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Qg7+ - forcing the king to move and potentially winning the h6 rook\nb) Rd7 - protecting the f7 pawn and potentially preparing to double rooks\nc) King moves - getting to safety\nLooking deeper at Qg7+:\n- Qg7+ Kh8 (forced)\n- Then Qxh6+ Kg8\n- Now White can play Qg7+ Kh8 with a repetition, but we want to win\n- Alternatively, after Qxh6+ Kg8, we can play Rd7 with strong pressure\nOther options:\n- Rd7 immediately is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- King moves don't address the immediate threats\nThe most forcing and promising line is Qg7+, which leads to winning the h6 rook while maintaining pressure. Even if Black tries to resist, White gains material and maintains the initiative.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc7g7\n```"
