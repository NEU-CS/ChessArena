When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully. Here's the FEN: `8/8/6pk/5p2/5K1p/5PPP/8/8 b - - 0 36`\nThis is a king and pawn endgame where Black is to move. Let's visualize the position:\n- White king is on f4\n- White has pawns on g3, h3, and f3\n- Black king is on g6\n- Black has pawns on h4 and f5\n- Black's h-pawn is on h6 (not h7 as I initially thought from the FEN)\nKey observations:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have king + 3 pawns)\n2. White's pawns are more advanced but somewhat blocked\n3. Black's h-pawn is passed but needs to be pushed carefully\n4. White's king is very active\nNow let's evaluate the candidate moves:\n1. h6h7:\n   - Advances the passed pawn but leaves it on h7 where it can be blockaded by White's king\n   - White can respond with Kf4-g5, attacking the f5 pawn\n   - Not the most precise\n2. h6g7:\n   - Moves the pawn sideways which doesn't make sense\n   - This would actually be illegal as pawns can't move sideways\n   - (Note: This appears to be an invalid move in the given list)\n3. h6h5:\n   - Advances the passed pawn but allows White to play g3-g4, opening lines\n   - After h5, g4 fxg4, fxg4 and White's king can become very active\n   - Risky as it gives White counterplay\n4. h4g3:\n   - Capturing the g3 pawn with hxg3\n   - After fxg3, White gets a passed f-pawn\n   - Black's h6 pawn becomes more vulnerable\n   - This seems too risky as it activates White's pawns\n5. g6g5:\n   - The most solid move\n   - Prepares to support the f5 pawn\n   - Limits White's king activity\n   - After Kg5, White can't play Kf4-g5 anymore\n   - Maintains all options for the h-pawn\nThe best move is g6g5 because:\n- It improves Black's king position\n- It prevents White's king from becoming more active\n- It maintains flexibility with the h-pawn\n- It doesn't create any weaknesses\n- It keeps all of Black's advantages in the position\nThe other moves either create weaknesses or don't improve Black's position as effectively.\n```\ng6g5\n```"
