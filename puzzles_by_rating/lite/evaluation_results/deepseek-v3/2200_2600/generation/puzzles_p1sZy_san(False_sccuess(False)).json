When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the material balance:\n   - White has: Queen, Bishop, Pawns (a5, d5, g2)\n   - Black has: Rook (e7), Rook (c2), Bishop (f6), Pawns (b7, a6, h5, g4)\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen on a3 is very active, eyeing the c1 square\n   - Black's king is exposed on b8\n   - White's bishop on b6 is pinning the a6 pawn to the king\n   - Black has doubled rooks on the 7th rank\n   - White's king is somewhat exposed on f4\n3. Threats:\n   - White threatens Qxc1 winning the rook\n   - Black's immediate threat is Rc4+ attacking the king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Rc4+ (c2c4): This seems strong as it forces the white king to move\n   - Rg7 (e7g7): Defends against potential Qxc1 while activating the rook\n   - Bg5 (f6g5): Attacks the queen while developing the bishop\n5. Analyzing Rc4+ (c2c4):\n   - After Kf3, we can play Rg7 (e7g7) with strong pressure\n   - Or after Ke3, we have Bg5+ winning the queen\n   - This seems very promising\n6. Other moves don't seem as strong:\n   - Moving the king (b8a8/c8) doesn't help our position\n   - Other rook moves don't create immediate threats\n   - Bishop moves other than Bg5 don't accomplish much\n7. After c2c4 Kf3 e7g7:\n   - White is under tremendous pressure\n   - We threaten Rf7+ winning the bishop\n   - The king is very exposed\nTherefore, the best move is to play Rc4+ forcing the king to move into a more vulnerable position, followed by activating our other rook with Rg7. This creates maximum pressure on White's position.\n```\nc2c4\n```"
