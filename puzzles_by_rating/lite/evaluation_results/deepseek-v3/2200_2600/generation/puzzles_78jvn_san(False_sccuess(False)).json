When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Evaluation**: \n   - Black has queen, rook, bishop vs White's queen, rook, knight\n   - Material is roughly equal (Black might be slightly better with bishop vs knight)\n2. **Positional Factors**:\n   - White has a strong centralized knight on e3\n   - Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n   - White's queen on h4 is very active and threatening\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n3. **Threats**:\n   - White has potential threats like Qh7+ or Qh8+\n   - Black needs to address these threats while improving his position\n4. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **b1h1**: Queen trade, but after Qxh1 Kxh1, White's rook becomes very active\n   - **f8f7**: Defends against Qh7+ but blocks the bishop\n   - **g8h8**: Gets the king out of potential checks but looks passive\n   - **e6f7**: Interesting - develops the bishop while defending h7\n5. **Best Move**:\n   - e6f7 is the most principled move:\n     - Develops the bishop to a more active square\n     - Defends against Qh7+ threats\n     - Opens potential for ...Rf8-e8 to centralize the rook\n     - Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n     - Maintains flexibility in the position\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new problems. For example, b1h1 leads to a worse endgame, and g8h8 is too passive.\n```\ne6f7\n```"
