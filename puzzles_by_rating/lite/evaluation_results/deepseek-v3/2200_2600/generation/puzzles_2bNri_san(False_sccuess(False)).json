When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Knight, Bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two bishops)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White has two active bishops pointing at Black's position\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White's rook is currently on e1\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e1e8 (rook lift to attack along the 8th rank)\n- g3d6 (bishop pinning the f8 rook to the king)\n- c2f5 (bishop checks the king)\n- b3b4 (pawn advance to challenge Black's pawn structure)\n4. Deep analysis of top candidates:\na) e1e8:\n- Immediately attacks the black rook on c8\n- If rook takes rook (c8e8), then g3d6+ wins the rook back with check\n- If black avoids the exchange, white can double rooks on the e-file\n- Very strong move that activates the rook maximally\nb) g3d6:\n- Pins the rook to the king\n- But black can play f6e7, unpinning and keeping material equal\n- Less forcing than e1e8\nc) c2f5+:\n- Checks the king but after f6g7, white doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- King just moves away safely\nd) b3b4:\n- Pawn break but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Black can respond with c5b4 or a7a5\n5. Conclusion:\ne1e8 is the most forcing and active move, creating immediate threats against Black's rook while activating White's rook to its maximum potential. It leads to either winning material or gaining a significant positional advantage.\n```\ne1e8\n```"
