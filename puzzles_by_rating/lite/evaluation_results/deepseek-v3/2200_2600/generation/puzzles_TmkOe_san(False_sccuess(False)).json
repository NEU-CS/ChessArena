When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White: Q+R+2B+N vs Black: Q+R+B+N). However, White has a more active position.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong pawn on f5, cramping Black's position\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n- White's queen on h3 is eyeing the h6 pawn and potentially the king\n- Black has a rook on b4 putting pressure on b2\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h3h6: Immediate queen sacrifice to open the h-file\n- c1h6: Bishop sacrifice to open the h-file\n- d3a6: Developing bishop with threat to c8\n- e4e5: Pushing central pawn to gain space\n4. Evaluating h3h6:\nThis is a spectacular queen sacrifice that leads to a forced win:\n- After h3h6 g7h6, White plays c1h6 with mate threats\n- Black's only defense is f6h7, but then f5f6! opens more lines\n- The attack is decisive as White's rooks will come to the h-file\n5. Other moves:\n- c1h6 is also strong, but less forcing than the queen sacrifice\n- d3a6 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- e4e5 is positionally good but misses the tactical opportunity\n6. Conclusion: The queen sacrifice h3h6 leads to a forced win and is the most precise move here. It opens the h-file and brings all of White's pieces into the attack against Black's exposed king.\n```\nh3h6\n```"
