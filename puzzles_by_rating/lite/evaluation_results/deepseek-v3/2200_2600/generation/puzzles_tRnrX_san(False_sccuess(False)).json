When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White: Q+R+R vs Black: Q+R+B). However, White has more active pieces and better coordination.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active, attacking f7 and g6\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5, but it's currently blockaded\n- White has rooks on e4 and d1 with potential to double on the e-file\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h8 (queen sacrifice): This looks tempting as it leads to mate after 1...Kxh8 2.Rh4+ Kg8 3.Rh8#\n- h5f7: Threatening mate on g7, but Black can defend with Qxf7\n- e4e6: Putting pressure on the e6 pawn and opening lines\n- d1d5: Challenging the passed pawn\n4. The most forcing and decisive move is h5h8, which leads to immediate checkmate:\n- After 1.Qh8+ Kxh8 (forced)\n- 2.Rh4+ Kg8 (only move)\n- 3.Rh8# (checkmate)\nAll other moves allow Black to continue the game, while h5h8 ends it immediately. The sacrifice is sound because even though we give up our queen, we get a forced mate in 3 moves.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh5h8\n```"
