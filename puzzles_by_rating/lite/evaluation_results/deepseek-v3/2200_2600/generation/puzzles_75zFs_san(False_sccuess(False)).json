When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, knight, 5 pawns vs White's rook, 2 bishops, knight, 5 pawns). However, White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n   - White has a strong pawn center with c4/e4/g4\n   - Black's knight on a4 is awkwardly placed\n   - White's bishops are very active, especially the dark-squared one on g3\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - g3b8: Bishop sacrifice to remove the defender of the rook\n   - d2f3: Centralizing the knight\n   - c2a4: Exchanging the annoying knight\n   - e4e5: Pushing the central pawn\n4. Deep analysis:\n   - g3b8 looks very tempting. After g3b8 axb8, White can play c2a4 winning the knight due to the pin. Black would have to give up the exchange (rook for bishop).\n   - d2f3 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats.\n   - c2a4 immediately wins the knight but allows Black counterplay with ...b5.\n   - e4e5 gives up control of d5 square.\n5. Best move:\ng3b8 is the most forcing and disruptive move. It either wins material or severely weakens Black's position. The bishop sacrifice is justified because:\n   - It removes the defender of the rook on e8\n   - Creates immediate threats against Black's king\n   - Opens lines for White's other pieces\n   - Even if Black doesn't take, White gains significant initiative\nAfter g3b8 axb8, c2a4 wins the knight as it's pinned to the queen. Black would likely have to play ...b5, but then cxb5 gives White a strong passed pawn.\n```\ng3b8\n```"
