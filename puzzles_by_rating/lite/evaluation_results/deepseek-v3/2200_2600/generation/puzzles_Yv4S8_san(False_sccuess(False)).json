When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n- Black has a king at f7, pawns at b7, g7, h6, a6, c6, f6\n- White has a king at d4, pawns at b4, c5, f5, h3, b2, g2\n- It's Black's turn (b in FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n- This is a pawn endgame where king activity is crucial\n- White's king is more centralized and active\n- Black's pawns are mostly blocked or restrained\n- Both sides have passed pawns (Black's b7, White's b4)\n3. Candidate moves evaluation:\n- f7g8/f7f8/f7e8: King moves backward - not helpful\n- f7e7: Centralizing the king, but allows White to push pawns\n- g7g6: Creates a passed h-pawn but weakens f6 pawn\n- b7b6: Creates a passed a-pawn but blocks own pawn\n- h6h5: Pushes the pawn but creates a target\n- a6a5: Pushes the pawn but creates a passed pawn for White\n- g7g5: Creates a passed h-pawn and challenges f5\n- b7b5: Creates a passed a-pawn and challenges b4\n4. Best options seem to be:\n- g7g5: Creates counterplay with the h-pawn while challenging f5\n- b7b5: Creates counterplay with the a-pawn while challenging b4\n5. Between these, g7g5 is stronger because:\n- After b7b5, White can play b4xb5, then a6xb5, and White's king can target the b-pawn\n- g7g5 creates immediate threats: if fxg6, then h6-h5-h4 creates a dangerous passed pawn\n- White would likely not take: f5xg6 f6xg6 and Black gets connected passed pawns\n6. After g7g5, possible continuation:\n- White might play Ke4 to defend f5\n- Then Black can play Kf7-e7-d7 to support the a-pawn\n- Or push h6-h5 if White doesn't take\nThis creates the most counterplay and keeps drawing chances.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng7g5\n```"
