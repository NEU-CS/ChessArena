When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 5 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, Queen, Bishop, 6 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black is up a pawn but White has better piece coordination)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on h6 is very active\n- Black's queen on c5 is centralized but exposed\n- White's bishop on b1 is blocked by pawns\n- Black has pressure along the c-file with their rook\n- White's king is somewhat exposed in the center\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h7: Rook moves forward, threatening to penetrate\n- d2a5: Queen takes the bishop (but after Qxa5, Black has Qxc2+)\n- d2g5: Queen moves to attack the f6 pawn and eye g7\n- d2d8: Queen infiltrates to the back rank\n- e4e5: Pawn push to gain space\n4. Analysis of best options:\n- h6h7 looks very strong as it threatens to check on h8, forcing Black's king to move and lose castling rights. After Kh8, White can consider Qg5 with threats against g7.\n- d2g5 is interesting but allows Black counterplay with ...Qxc2+ in some lines\n- d2d8 is tempting but Black can defend with ...Rf8\n- e4e5 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n5. Tactical considerations:\nAfter h6h7 Kh8, if Qg5, Black can't take the queen due to Rh8#. This creates serious mating threats.\nThe most forcing and dangerous move is h6h7, creating immediate threats against Black's king while maintaining all of White's positional advantages.\n```\nh6h7\n```"
