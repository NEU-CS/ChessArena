When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This is a pawn endgame where king activity and pawn structure are crucial\n2. Black's pawns are more advanced but White has a passed pawn on b3\n3. Black's king is more centralized while White's king is somewhat restricted\n4. White's pawns are vulnerable to being fixed or blockaded\nCandidate moves evaluation:\n1. c4b4 - Moves king towards black's pawns but leaves b3 pawn undefended\n2. c4d3 - Centralizes king but blocks c2 pawn\n3. c4c3 - Doesn't achieve much, keeps king passive\n4. b3b4 - Advances passed pawn but allows black to blockade with ...Kd6\n5. c2c3 - Creates a pawn duo but fixes pawns on light squares\n6. a2a3 - Prepares a4 push but is slow\n7. a2a4 - Immediately fixes black's a-pawn but weakens b4 square\nBest move considerations:\n- We need to activate our king while maintaining pawn flexibility\n- c4d3 seems most promising as it:\n  * Centralizes the king\n  * Prepares to support the b-pawn's advance\n  * Keeps options open for both a-pawn and c-pawn\n  * Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n- Other moves either create weaknesses or don't improve our position\nAfter c4d3, possible continuation might be:\n- ...Kd6 (black centralizes)\n- Kc4 (white maintains position)\n- Then we can consider advancing pawns when appropriate\nThe move c4d3 gives White the most flexibility and king activity without creating weaknesses.\n```\nc4d3\n```"
