When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: Rook, 3 pawns\n- Black: Knight, 5 pawns\n- Black is up a pawn, but White has active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on d6\n- White's rook is very active on c5\n- Black's pawn structure is loose with doubled e-pawns\n- White's king is relatively safe on c2\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5d5: Pinning the e5 pawn to the king\n- c5e5: Capturing the pawn with check\n- c5c6: Attacking the knight\n- c5a5: Going after the a6 pawn\n4. Analysis of c5e5+:\n- After c5e5+, Black must play d6e5 (king takes)\n- Then we can play b4b5, threatening to promote the pawn\n- Black's knight is tied to defending the a6 pawn\n- This leads to a passed b-pawn that will be very dangerous\n5. Other moves:\n- c5d5 is also strong, pinning the e5 pawn\n- But c5e5+ is more forcing and leads to immediate material gain\n- c5c6 allows Nxc6 which isn't as good for White\n6. Conclusion:\nc5e5+ is the most forcing and best move, winning a pawn and activating our passed pawn. The resulting position after d6e5 b4b5 gives White excellent winning chances with the advanced b-pawn.\nHere's the move:\n```\nc5e5\n```"
