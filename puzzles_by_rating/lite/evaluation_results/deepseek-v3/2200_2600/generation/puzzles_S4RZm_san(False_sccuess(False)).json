When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and pawns)\n2. White has a passed e-pawn that's already on e5\n3. Black has a strong knight on d3 attacking White's rook\n4. Black's bishop on b4 is very active\n5. White's king is somewhat exposed\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5e6 - advancing the passed pawn\n2. d2xd3 - capturing the knight\n3. f7h8 or f7d8 - knight moves\n4. f6g5 - bishop moves\nLet's evaluate:\n1. e5e6 looks tempting to push the passed pawn, but after ...d4! Black gets strong counterplay with their pawns.\n2. d2xd3 seems forced since the rook is under attack. After dxd3, Black can recapture with either pawn or bishop:\n   - 2a) ...cxd3 - then White can play f6g5 attacking the bishop\n   - 2b) ...Bxd3+ - then Ke2 and White's king becomes active\n3. Knight moves don't seem to accomplish much - the knights are well placed where they are.\n4. f6g5 looks interesting to attack the bishop, but it allows Black to play ...Nxf2! winning the rook.\nAfter careful consideration, dxd3 is the most principled move as we can't afford to lose the rook. After ...Bxd3+, White's king becomes active which is good for the endgame.\nBetween the two recapture options, ...Bxd3+ is more likely as it keeps the pawn structure intact for Black.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd2d3\n```"
