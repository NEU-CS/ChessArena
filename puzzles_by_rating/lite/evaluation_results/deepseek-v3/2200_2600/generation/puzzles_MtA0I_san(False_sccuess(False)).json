When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has 3 pawns (e5, f4, h4)\n- Black has 3 pawns (a3, b2, g6) and a king\n- Material is equal (3 pawns vs 3 pawns)\n2. King positions:\n- White king is on b1\n- Black king is on f5\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White has connected passed pawns on e5 and f4\n- Black has a passed pawn on b2 that's very dangerous\n- Black's g6 pawn is blocking White's h4 pawn\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\na) b1c2 - moves king towards black's passed pawn\n   - After b1c2, black can play b2b1=Q and we lose\n   - Not good\nb) b1a2 - moves king towards black's passed pawn\n   - After b1a2, black can play b2b1=Q and we lose\n   - Not good\nc) e5e6 - pushes the central passed pawn\n   - After e5e6, black must respond with f5xe6 (forced capture)\n   - Then we can play f4f5, creating a new passed pawn\n   - This seems promising as it trades one passed pawn for another while improving our structure\nd) g3g4 - pushes the g-pawn\n   - This doesn't address the immediate threat of b2 promotion\n   - Black can play b2b1=Q next move\n   - Not good\n5. Best move is e5e6 because:\n- It forces black to capture (f5xe6)\n- Then we can play f4f5 with a strong passed pawn\n- Meanwhile, our king can start moving towards the b2 pawn\n- This is the only move that both creates counterplay and prevents immediate loss\nThe other moves either allow immediate promotion or don't create enough counterplay.\n```\ne5e6\n```"
