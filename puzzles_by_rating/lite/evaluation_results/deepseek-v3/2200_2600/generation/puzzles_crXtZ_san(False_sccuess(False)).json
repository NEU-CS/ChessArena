When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and position:\n- Black has king on g7, rook on e4, bishop on d4, pawn on b5\n- White has king on f3, rook on d6, bishop on g5, pawn on e7\n- White's e7 pawn is very advanced and threatening to promote\n2. Key observations:\n- White's e7 pawn is one move away from queening\n- Black's rook on e4 is currently blocking the pawn's path\n- White's rook on d6 is very active and controls the 6th rank\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7\n3. Immediate threats:\n- If White promotes the pawn (e7e8), Black must respond carefully\n- White could also play Rd6-d8 threatening to support the pawn\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4e7 - capturing the pawn immediately\n- g7h7 - moving king away from potential checks\n- d4f2 - bishop move attacking white king\n5. Evaluating e4e7:\n- Takes the dangerous pawn off the board\n- But after e4e7, Bg5xe7 and Black loses the rook\n- This leads to a losing endgame for Black\n6. Evaluating g7h7:\n- Gets king off the g-file where White's rook could check\n- But doesn't address the pawn threat\n- White can simply push e7e8 next move\n7. Evaluating d4f2:\n- Puts pressure on White's king\n- But doesn't stop e7e8 promotion\n- White can ignore and promote with check\n8. Best option appears to be e4e7 despite losing the rook:\n- It's the only way to prevent immediate promotion\n- After e4e7 Bxe7, Black can play d4f2+ forcing Kxf2\n- Then material is roughly equal (bishop vs rook) but position is drawish\n9. Other moves either allow promotion or lead to worse positions.\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the pawn immediately:\n```\ne4e7\n```"
