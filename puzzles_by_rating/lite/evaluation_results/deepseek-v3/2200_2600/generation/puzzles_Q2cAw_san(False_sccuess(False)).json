When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: Rook, Knight, Queen, 4 pawns\n- Black: Queen, Rook, Bishop, 6 pawns\nBlack is up 2 pawns in material.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has strong pressure on f4 (rook) and e4 (pawn)\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n- Black's queen is very active on b6\n- White has some counterplay with the passed d5 pawn\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...Rxf3, removing a key defender\n- Black could play ...Qxd4, winning a pawn\n- Black might prepare ...h5-h4 to open lines against the king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) f3g5 - attacking the bishop, but after ...hxg5 White's position collapses\nb) e2e4 - challenging Black's center, but allows ...fxe4 with strong pressure\nc) c1c6 - pinning the queen to the king, but Black can play ...Qxc6\nd) g1h2 - moving the king to safety\ne) f3d4 - centralizing the knight and defending e2\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f3d4 seems most solid, defending e2 and centralizing the knight\n- It prevents ...Rxf3 ideas\n- The knight becomes more active and can jump to e6 or f5 later\n- It maintains control over key squares\nOther options have drawbacks:\n- f3g5 is too risky due to ...hxg5\n- e2e4 weakens our position\n- c1c6 loses material\n- King moves don't address the immediate threats\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf3d4\n```"
