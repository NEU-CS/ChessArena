When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has a rook, pawn on c7, pawn on g3, pawn on f2, pawn on h2\n- Black has a king on c8, bishop on c4, pawn on g6, pawn on f5, pawn on d3\n- White is up a rook for a bishop, but has a passed pawn on c7\n2. Key features:\n- White's c7 pawn is one square away from promotion\n- Black's king is on c8, directly in front of the pawn\n- White's rook on e7 is very active\n- Black's bishop controls the a2-g8 diagonal\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8 (rook to promotion square)\n- e7c7 (not legal, not in the list)\n- c7c8q (not legal, not in the list)\n- g1g2 (king moves toward center)\n4. Analysis:\n- e7e8 looks very strong - it attacks the black king and defends the c7 pawn's promotion square\n- After e7e8, if Black takes with Kxe8, then c7c8Q+ wins the bishop\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play c7c8Q next move\n- Other rook moves don't accomplish as much\n- King moves are too slow when we have a winning tactic\n5. Conclusion:\ne7e8 is the strongest move, creating an unstoppable threat of promotion while also attacking the black king. Black has no good defense against this.\n```\ne7e8\n```"
