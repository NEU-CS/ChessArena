When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: King, Rook, 2 pawns (h4, g2)\n- Black has: King, Rook, 3 pawns (a5, f4, g4)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but pawn structure favors Black who has connected passed pawns on the kingside.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is active on e4\n- Black's rook controls the 3rd rank\n- White's h-pawn is passed but blocked by Black's g-pawn\n- Black's a-pawn is dangerous if it queens\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens to push g4-g3, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- White needs to activate the rook or king to counter this\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Rook moves:\n- h5h8: Gets rook behind Black's a-pawn\n- h5g5: Attacks g4 pawn\n- h5e5: Checks the king\nb) King moves:\n- g1h2: Gets closer to the action\n- g1f2: Centralizes king\nc) Pawn moves:\n- g2g3: Immediately challenges Black's pawns\n- a2a4: Stops Black's a-pawn\n5. Evaluation:\n- h5h8 looks strong as it threatens to go after Black's a-pawn while keeping pressure on the kingside\n- g2g3 is tempting but after fxg3, Black's pawns become more dangerous\n- h5g5 allows Black to play g3 with tempo\n- King moves are too slow given the pawn race\n6. Best move:\nh5h8 is the most active rook move, preparing to swing to a8 to stop Black's a-pawn while maintaining kingside pressure. This gives White counterplay against both flanks.\n```\nh5h8\n```"
