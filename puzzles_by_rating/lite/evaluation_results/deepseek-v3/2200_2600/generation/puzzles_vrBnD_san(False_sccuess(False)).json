When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully.\nFirst, let's assess the material balance:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop, pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a strong attack with the queen on g7 and rook on f6.\nKey observations:\n1. White's queen on g7 is attacking the king and the rook on f7\n2. Black's king is exposed and under pressure\n3. Black's rook on f8 is pinned to the king by White's rook on f6\n4. Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on a7\nThe most critical threats:\n- White could play Qxf7+ next move, winning material\n- The pin on the f-file is very dangerous\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f8g8 - unpinning the rook and defending g7\n2. e7e8 - moving the king away from danger\n3. c7d8 - moving the queen to defend g7\n4. e5g6 - counterattacking the queen\nLet's evaluate these:\n1. f8g8:\n- Defends g7 but leaves the rook on f8 still pinned\n- After Qxf7+, Rxf7 Rxf7 and Black loses material\n2. e7e8:\n- Gets the king out of immediate danger\n- But Qxf7 is still possible, winning the rook\n3. c7d8:\n- Queen defends g7\n- But then White can play Qxf7+ Qxf7 Rxf7 and Black is still losing material\n4. e5g6:\n- Attacks the queen while defending f7\n- If Qxg6, then fxg6 and the position becomes more balanced\n- This seems like the best practical chance\nAfter e5g6 Qxg6 fxg6:\n- The immediate threat is neutralized\n- Material is roughly equal (rook+bishop vs queen)\n- Black's position becomes more defensible\nOther moves either don't solve the immediate threats or lead to material loss. Therefore, e5g6 is the best practical choice to counter White's attack.\n```\ne5g6\n```"
