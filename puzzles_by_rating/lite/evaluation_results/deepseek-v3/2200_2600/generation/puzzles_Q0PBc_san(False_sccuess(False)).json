When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\n- White has: Queen, Bishop, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very strong, eyeing g8 and h7 squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's bishop on d5 controls important diagonals\n- Black's queen on g7 is somewhat restricted by White's queen\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qxg6 or Qh6+\n- Black needs to defend against these while maintaining counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7h6: Defends against Qh6+ while attacking White's queen\n- f8f7: Defends the 7th rank and prepares to double rooks\n- g7g8: Gets the queen out of the line of fire from White's bishop\n5. Analysis:\n- g7h6 seems most forcing: After Qxh6 Rxh6, Black gets the queen but White's bishop and passed pawns become dangerous\n- f8f7 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- g7g8 allows White to play Qh6+ with a strong attack\n6. Best move:\ng7h6 creates immediate counterplay by attacking White's queen while defending against Qh6+. Even though it leads to a queen trade, Black's rook and pawns can create counterplay against White's bishop and pawns.\nThe move also prevents White from building a mating attack with Qh6+ followed by bringing more pieces to the attack.\n```\ng7h6\n```"
