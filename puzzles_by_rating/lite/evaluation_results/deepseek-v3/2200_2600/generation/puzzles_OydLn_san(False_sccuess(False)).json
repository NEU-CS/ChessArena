When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance and position:\n- Black has: king, pawns (g7, h7), queen (c6), rooks (c5), bishop (e5)\n- White has: king, pawns (a2, b2, f5, g3, h2), queen (b3), rook (f1), knight (g1)\n- Black is down a pawn but has active pieces. White's king is exposed on g1.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's rook on c5 is attacked by White's queen on b3\n- Black's queen on c6 is defending the rook\n- White's pawn on f5 is passed and dangerous\n- Black's bishop on e5 is very active, eyeing g3 and h2\n3. Evaluating candidate moves:\n- f7f8/f7e8: King moves don't help, we need to be active\n- f7e7: Doesn't accomplish much\n- f7f6: Could be considered to stop f5-f6 push\n- c6d5: Queen moves away from defending rook, bad\n- c5d5: Rook moves away from attack while maintaining pressure\n- c5c4: Rook moves forward, but doesn't solve attack issue\n- d6d5: Queen moves to d5, but allows White to play Qxc5\n4. Best options seem to be:\n- c5d5: Moves rook to safety while maintaining pressure on d-file\n- f7f6: Prevents f5-f6 push which could be dangerous\nBetween these, c5d5 is stronger because:\n- It maintains all our piece activity\n- The rook on d5 is very strong, eyeing d2 and d1 squares\n- We don't need to worry about f5-f6 immediately as our pieces are active\n- After c5d5, if White takes with Qxc5, we have Qxc5 with a strong queen\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc5d5\n```"
