When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Rook, 2 pawns vs Black's Rook, Rook, 2 pawns - material is equal.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h5\n- Black has a passed b-pawn on b2\n- Black's rook on g5 is very active\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on f1\n- White has a rook on c7 that could potentially become active\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7g7: Challenging Black's active rook\n- h5h6: Advancing the passed pawn\n- a1b1: Dealing with the dangerous b-pawn\n- f1e1: Improving king safety\n4. Analysis of options:\n- c7g7: After Rxg7 hxg7, Black can play Rb1+ and the b-pawn becomes dangerous\n- h5h6: This looks strong as it threatens h7, forcing Black to deal with it\n- a1b1: Immediately deals with the b-pawn but gives up control of the a-file\n- f1e1: Doesn't address any immediate threats\n5. Best move seems to be h5h6:\n- Creates an immediate threat to promote the pawn\n- Black must respond to this threat\n- After h6, if gxh6 then Rxh7 with strong play\n- If Black doesn't take, we can push h7 next move\n- The pawn is more dangerous than Black's b-pawn\n6. Other considerations:\n- The b-pawn is dangerous but not immediately promoting\n- The h-pawn is closer to promotion\n- Activating the rook with c7g7 leads to simplifications that might favor Black\nAfter careful consideration, advancing the h-pawn is the most forcing and dangerous move for White.\n```\nh5h6\n```"
