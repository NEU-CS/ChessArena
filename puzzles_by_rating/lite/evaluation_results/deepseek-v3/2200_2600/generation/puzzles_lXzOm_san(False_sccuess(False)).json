When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has Q+R+R vs Black's R+B+N (roughly equal material)\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has a strong queen on c5 attacking multiple squares\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen is eyeing the f8 square (potential back rank mate ideas)\n- White's rooks are well placed on f1 and f2\n- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n3. Critical observations:\n- Black's bishop on f5 is under attack by White's queen\n- Black's king safety is a major concern\n- The pawn on e5 is pinned to the king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g7 (king moves away from danger)\n- f5h7 (bishop retreats while maintaining defense)\n- e5e6 (pushing the pawn to break the pin)\n- c7e6 (knight moves to defend)\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f7g7 looks safest, getting the king away from potential checks\n- f5h7 maintains the bishop but leaves the king exposed\n- e5e6 is risky as it opens lines towards Black's king\n- c7e6 allows White to play Qxf5 winning material\nThe best move is to get the king to safety while maintaining material balance. f7g7 accomplishes this by:\n- Moving the king away from potential checks\n- Keeping all pieces defended\n- Not creating any new weaknesses\nAll other moves either lose material or leave the king in danger.\n```\nf7g7\n```"
