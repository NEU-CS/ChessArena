When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has bishop, knight, queen vs Black's rook, bishop, queen. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's bishop on c5 is very strong, eyeing Black's king\n- Black's rook on f4 is attacking White's knight on f3\n- White's queen on g3 is well placed\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5e7: Bishop sacrifice to expose Black's king\n- g3g6: Queen sacrifice to open up Black's king\n- f3g5: Knight move attacking Black's queen\n- e1e5: Rook lift to potentially double on the e-file\n4. Deep analysis:\n- c5e7 looks very promising: After ...dxe7, Qxg6! hxg6, Bxg6 with a strong attack\n- g3g6 is tempting but after ...hxg6, Bxg6 Qe7 holds for Black\n- f3g5 Qxg5, Qxg5 hxg5 and Black is okay\n- e1e5 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n5. The bishop sacrifice c5e7 leads to a forced win:\n- c5e7 dxe7 (forced)\n- Qxg6! hxg6\n- Bxg6 Qe7 (only move to prevent mate)\n- Nh4! threatening Nf5 with mate to follow\nBlack has no good defense against this attack.\nThe move c5e7 is a decisive sacrifice that leads to a winning attack against Black's king. The other moves don't offer the same immediate winning potential.\n```\nc5e7\n```"
