When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has bishop (f7), bishop (g5), rook (f1), knight (b1), queen (d1), king (g1), pawns\n- Black has rook (a8), bishop (c8), queen (c5), knight (d4), knight (f6), king (f8), pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has a strong initiative\n2. Key observations:\n- White's bishop on f7 is very active, attacking black's king position\n- Black's king is exposed with weak dark squares around it\n- Black has a knight on d4 attacking f3 square\n- White has a bishop on g5 pinning the knight on f6 to the queen on c5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Sacrificing the bishop to open up black's king\n- f7e8: Another sacrifice option\n- g5f6: Taking the pinned knight\n- d1h5: Bringing queen into attack\n- f1f6: Rook lift to attack\n4. Deep analysis:\n- f7g8 looks very promising: After Bxg8 Rxg8, White can play Qh5+ with a devastating attack (Ke7 Qf7+ Kd6 and White has many threats)\n- g5f6 is solid but less forcing: Qxf6 and black can defend\n- d1h5 is good but black can defend with g6\n- f1f6 is interesting but black can take with Nxf6\n5. Best move:\nf7g8 is the most forcing and leads to a winning attack. After:\n- f7g8 Rxg8\n- Qh5+ Ke7 (only move)\n- Qf7+ Kd6\n- White has multiple threats including Bf4+, Rf6+, etc. with a decisive advantage\nThe bishop sacrifice opens up black's king and leads to a forced win.\n```\nf7g8\n```"
