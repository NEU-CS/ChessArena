When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has Q+2B+N vs Black's Q+B+N, but White has doubled pawns). The position is roughly balanced.\n2. Key features:\n- White has two active bishops pointing at Black's kingside\n- Black has a knight on g4 that's somewhat loose\n- White's pawn structure is slightly compromised with doubled d-pawns\n- Black's king is still in the center (f8)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) g5e7 - Bishop sacrifice to remove Black's strong e7 queen\nb) c4e6 - Bishop move attacking the queen and threatening discoveries\nc) f4e5 - Pawn break to open the position\nd) a3b5 - Knight move attacking c7\n4. Deep analysis:\n- g5e7 looks tempting: Bxe7 Qxe7, but then Black's queen is centralized and White's bishop pair is gone. Not clearly better.\n- c4e6: Qxe6 Bxe6 leaves White with bishop pair but loses the queen exchange. Not necessarily favorable.\n- f4e5: dxe5 Nxe5 and Black's pieces become active. Not ideal.\n- a3b5: Threatening c7, but Black can defend with Qc5 or Qd8.\n5. Best option appears to be g5h6:\n- Attacks the loose knight on g4\n- If Nxh6, Qxg7+! Kxg7 Bxh6+ wins the knight back with a better position\n- If Black moves the knight (Nf6 or Ne3), we maintain pressure\n- Creates potential for a kingside attack\n6. Other moves like g2g3 or h4h5 are too slow and don't address the immediate position.\nAfter careful consideration, g5h6 seems the most principled move, maintaining pressure while not allowing Black any counterplay.\n```\ng5h6\n```"
