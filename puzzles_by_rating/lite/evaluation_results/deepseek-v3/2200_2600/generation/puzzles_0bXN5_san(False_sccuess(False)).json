When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This seems critical.\n   - **g1h2**: Bishop could capture the g3 pawn, but it's defended by Black's king.\n   - Other king moves don't address the immediate threat.\n6. **Analyzing e2f3**:\n   - After e2f3, Black can play h5h4 (pushing the other pawn) or king moves.\n   - White's bishop can then try to stop the h-pawn.\n   - The position remains tricky but holds for now.\n7. **Analyzing g1h2**:\n   - Bishop takes g3: g1h2\n   - Black recaptures with king: kxh2\n   - Then White's king can move to f3, but Black's h-pawn is still dangerous.\n   - This leads to a lost position as Black's h-pawn will promote.\n8. **Other Bishop Moves**:\n   - Moving the bishop elsewhere doesn't stop the g3 pawn's threat.\n   - For example, g1f2 allows g3g2, and the pawn promotes.\n9. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only move that stops the immediate threat of g3g2 is **e2f3**, blocking the pawn with the king.\n   - After e2f3, White can try to coordinate king and bishop to stop Black's pawns, though it's still difficult.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne2f3\n```"
