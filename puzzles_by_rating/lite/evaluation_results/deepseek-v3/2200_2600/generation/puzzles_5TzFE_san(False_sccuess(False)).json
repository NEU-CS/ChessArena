When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (bishop vs 2 pawns), but White's pawns are advanced\n2. White's b-pawn is on b4 and could potentially promote if not stopped\n3. White's c-pawn is on c2 and not an immediate threat\n4. Black's bishop is controlling the a6-c8 diagonal\nMain threats:\n- White could try to push the b-pawn: b5 would threaten promotion\n- White's king is well placed to support the pawn\nBest defensive plan for Black:\n1. Stop the b-pawn from advancing\n2. Keep the king active to help stop the pawns\n3. Ideally, we want to capture one of the pawns\nLooking at the moves:\n- Bishop moves: We should keep control of the a6-c8 diagonal to prevent b5\n  - b5a4 looks good as it maintains control of b5 square\n  - Other bishop moves would allow b5\n- King moves: We should bring the king closer to the pawns\n  - g6f5 is interesting as it approaches both pawns\n  - g6f6 is also reasonable, keeping options open\nBetween b5a4 and g6f5, g6f5 seems more active:\n- After g6f5, if White plays b5, we can respond with f5e4, attacking both pawns\n- The bishop still controls b5 from a4, but the king becomes more active\nOther moves like g6g7 would be too passive and allow White to push the pawn.\nTherefore, the best move is g6f5, bringing the king closer to the action while maintaining control over the position.\n```\ng6f5\n```"
