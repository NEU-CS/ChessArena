When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has Q+B vs Black's Q+R+R (material is roughly equal)\n- But White's queen is very active on c5, attacking the d5 pawn and eyeing the f8 square\n2. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on g4\n- White has threats like Qf8+ or Qxd5+\n- Black's rooks are not connected and not very active\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g4h5: moves king away from center but still exposed\n- g4g5: moves king forward but doesn't improve safety\n- g4h4: moves king towards the h-file but still vulnerable\n- g4f4: moves king towards center but might be more dangerous\n4. Threats to consider:\n- After any king move, White can play Qxd5+ winning the pawn\n- White can also consider Qf8+ in some lines\n- Black needs to find a way to activate his rooks\nThe best move appears to be g4h5 because:\n- It moves the king away from potential checks on the f-file\n- It maintains some flexibility for the king\n- Other moves either push the king into more danger (g4g5) or don't improve the position\nAfter g4h5, if White plays Qxd5+, Black can respond with ...Qxd5 Bxd5 when Black's rooks might become active. The position remains complicated but this seems the most resilient choice.\n```\ng4h5\n```"
