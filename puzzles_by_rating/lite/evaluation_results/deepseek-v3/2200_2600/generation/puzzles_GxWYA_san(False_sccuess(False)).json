When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\nMaterial is equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n2. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on b5\n- White's king is on f3, also somewhat exposed\n- Both sides have threats against the opponent's king\n3. Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on b7 that could become dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's rook on g6 is very active\n- White's rook on h7 is threatening Black's king\n4. Threats:\n- White is threatening Rh7xb7, winning a pawn\n- White also has ideas like Rc3xb4, though this would be dangerous due to Black's active pieces\n5. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Rook trade that would relieve pressure but give up activity\n- g6g3: Very tempting, attacking the white king and threatening mate\n- b5c6: Moving the king to safety while attacking the c5 pawn\n- c4e2: Bishop move that threatens to win the f2 pawn\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g6g3 is extremely strong because:\n  * It threatens mate on f3 (with Rf3#)\n  * White has no good way to defend:\n    - If Ke2, then Rxf2+ wins material\n    - If Rf1, then Rxf1+ Kxf1 Rxh4 wins a pawn\n    - If any other move, Rf3+ leads to mate or massive material loss\nThe other moves don't create such immediate threats or allow White counterplay. For example:\n- b5c6 allows Rh7xb7 with counterplay\n- d8h8 trades away an active rook\n- c4e2 is good but not as forcing as g6g3\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng6g3\n```"
