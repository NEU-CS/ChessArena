When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, rook, bishop, knight, queen, 3 pawns\n- White has: king, queen, bishop, 2 rooks, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black has knight vs White's extra rook, but White's pawns are more advanced)\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on b7 that's threatening to promote\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White's queen is very active on c4\n- Black's queen is active but somewhat exposed on g3\n- Black has some tactical possibilities due to White's exposed king\n3. Critical threats:\n- White's immediate threat is b7-b8=Q\n- Black needs to address this while maintaining counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\na) b8b7 - blocking the pawn with the king, but this seems dangerous as it walks into checks\nb) e8e7 - moving the rook to defend the promotion square, but allows White to play Qxd4\nc) g3c7 - queen sacrifice to eliminate the dangerous pawn\nd) g5f7 - knight move attacking White's rook on c1\n5. Evaluating g3c7:\n- Qxc7 bxc7\n- Now Black can play Rd8, threatening to win the pawn on c7\n- White would have to defend carefully, but Black gets active pieces\n- This eliminates the immediate promotion threat\n6. Other options seem worse:\n- b8b7 allows Qc7+ winning the rook\n- e8e7 allows Qxd4 with advantage to White\n- g5f7 is interesting but doesn't solve the pawn promotion threat\n7. After g3c7 bxc7 Rd8:\n- Black's rook becomes very active\n- The c7 pawn is weak\n- Black's pieces coordinate well\n- White's king remains exposed\nThe best move is the queen sacrifice to eliminate the dangerous passed pawn and activate Black's rook. \n```\ng3c7\n```"
