When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the position:\n- Black is down material (White has an extra pawn and better piece coordination)\n- White has strong pressure on the dark squares (with the bishop on e3 and queen on f3)\n- Black's knight on a5 is poorly placed\n- Black's queen on a3 is active but somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n2. Key threats/ideas:\n- White may look to play d5 soon, opening lines\n- Black needs to activate pieces and create counterplay\n- The c-file is important, with rooks facing each other\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a5b7: Developing the knight to a better square\n- c8c1: Exchanging rooks to relieve pressure\n- a3e7: Queen move threatening e7 pawn\n- g7g5: Creating kingside play\n4. Evaluating a5b7:\n- Moves the knight to a more active square\n- Threatens to jump to d6 or c5\n- But doesn't address immediate concerns\n5. Evaluating c8c1:\n- Exchanges rooks which may relieve pressure\n- But after Rxc1, White's rook becomes more active\n- Doesn't solve long-term problems\n6. Evaluating a3e7:\n- Puts pressure on e7 pawn\n- After Qxe7, Bxe7 Rxe7, Black wins a pawn but loses queen for rook+bishop\n- Not favorable material-wise\n7. Evaluating g7g5:\n- Creates kingside counterplay\n- Prepares to push pawns and open files\n- May weaken the king but creates activity\n8. Best choice:\ng7g5 seems most principled, creating counterplay on the kingside where Black has some space advantage. The other moves either don't improve the position or lead to unfavorable exchanges.\nThe move prepares g5-g4 ideas to harass White's queen and potentially open lines against White's king. While it does weaken the king position slightly, Black needs active counterplay to balance White's positional advantages.\n```\ng7g5\n```"
