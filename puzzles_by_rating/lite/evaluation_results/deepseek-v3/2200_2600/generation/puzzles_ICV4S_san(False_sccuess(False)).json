When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, rook, bishop, knight, queen, rook, pawns\n- White has: rook, bishop, knight, queen, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black has slightly more active pieces)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on e6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's queen on d5 is active but somewhat exposed\n- Both sides have rooks that could become more active\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h8g8 - Connecting rooks and getting off the open file\nb) d5e4 - Queen move attacking e2 queen\nc) c6e5 - Knight move attacking white's e6 knight\nd) h4h5 - Advancing the rook's pawn\n4. Analysis of candidates:\na) h8g8 - Safe but somewhat passive. White could play Qf3 next with pressure.\nb) d5e4 - Qxe2 Rxe2 leaves Black down material after Rxe2\nc) c6e5 - Nxe5 dxe5 Qxe5 looks promising, but after Qxe5 Bxe5, Black's pieces become active\nd) h4h5 - Doesn't accomplish much immediately\n5. Best option appears to be c6e5:\n- Challenges White's strong knight\n- Opens up the position for Black's pieces\n- After Nxe5 dxe5 Qxe5, Black gets active play with Qxe5 Bxe5\n- Black's bishop pair could become strong in the resulting position\n6. Alternatives:\n- d5e4 is too risky due to material loss\n- h8g8 is too passive\n- Other moves don't address White's central control\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc6e5\n```"
