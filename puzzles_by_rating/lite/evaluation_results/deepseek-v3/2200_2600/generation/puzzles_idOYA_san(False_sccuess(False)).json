When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, rook, bishop, queen, 6 pawns\n- White has: king, rook, knight, queen, bishop, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black is down a minor piece but has an extra pawn)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed in the center (e8)\n- White has strong pressure with queen on e4 and bishop on d3\n- Black's queen on c3 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- Both sides have castling rights but haven't castled yet\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxd4 winning a piece\n- White also has potential threats like Rd1-d2-c2 attacking the queen\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8g8 (castling) - gets king to safety but allows Qxd4\n- c3a5 - queen retreat but seems passive\n- d4e3 - counterattacking the queen\n- c5c4 - advancing the passed pawn\n- e8d8 - king moves sideways\n5. Best options:\n- d4e3 looks very strong:\n  - Attacks the white queen\n  - If Qxe3, then c3xe3 wins the queen\n  - If Q moves away, we maintain the bishop and keep pressure\n  - Even if White plays Qxd4, we have c3xd4 and our pawn structure remains solid\n6. Other moves have issues:\n- Castling allows Qxd4\n- Queen retreats lose initiative\n- King moves don't solve the pressure\nAfter careful consideration, d4e3 is the most forcing and best move, creating immediate threats while maintaining material balance.\n```\nd4e3\n```"
