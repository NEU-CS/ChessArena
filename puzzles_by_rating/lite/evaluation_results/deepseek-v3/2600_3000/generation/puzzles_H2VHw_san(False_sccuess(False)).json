When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and position:\n- Black has a king on h7, bishop on b4, pawns on g6 and h5\n- White has a king on e6, knight on e5, pawn on f7, and pawn on h3\n- It's Black's move (b - - 0 62 in FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n- White's f-pawn is very dangerous (on f7) and could promote soon\n- Black's bishop is very active and can control important squares\n- Both kings are active in the endgame\n- White's knight is well placed on e5\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play f8=Q next move if we don't stop it\n- Our king is somewhat exposed on h7\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h7h8 - moves king away from potential checks but doesn't address f-pawn\nb) h7g7 - blocks the f-pawn with king\nc) b4e7 - bishop blocks the f-pawn\nd) g6g5 - pushes pawn but doesn't address immediate threat\ne) b4f8 - bishop blocks promotion square\n5. Evaluating best options:\n- h7g7 seems most direct - king blocks the pawn and prevents promotion\n- b4e7 is tempting but after fxe7 Kxe7, we lose the bishop\n- b4f8 is interesting but after Kxf8, we lose the bishop and white promotes\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threat\n6. After h7g7:\n- White can't play f8=Q because our king controls g7\n- White might try Ke7, but then we can play Bc5+ forcing the king away\n- Our bishop remains active and can create counterplay\n7. Other moves either lose material or don't stop the promotion threat.\nTherefore, the best move is to block the pawn with the king:\n```\nh7g7\n```"
