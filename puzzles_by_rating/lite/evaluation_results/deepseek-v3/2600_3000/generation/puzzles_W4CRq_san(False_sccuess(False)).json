When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

First, let's understand the position:\n- White has: King on f1, Queen on h5, Bishop on g5 and g6, Rook on h3, pawns on a2, b2, h2\n- Black has: King on g8, Queen on d6, Bishop on d4 and d5, Rook on c1, pawns on a7, b6\n- White is to move (as indicated by 'w' in FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's rook on c1 is attacking White's king (check)\n- White must respond to this check\n- Black has two bishops controlling important diagonals\n- White's queen and bishops are active but somewhat exposed\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\na) f1e2 - King moves to e2:\n   - Gets out of check\n   - But moves into the line of Black's bishop on d4 (e2 is on the same diagonal)\n   - After ...Bxe2, White would lose the king\n   - Therefore, this is a losing move\nb) h5d1 - Queen takes rook on d1:\n   - Captures the checking piece\n   - But after Qxd1, Black can play Bxg5, winning a bishop\n   - White would be down material (queen vs two bishops and rook)\n   - Not the best option\nc) g5c1 - Bishop takes rook on c1:\n   - Captures the checking piece\n   - After Bxc1, Black can play Qxg6 (but White has Bxg6 in response)\n   - Or Black could play Qd1+ but White has Qxd1\n   - This seems to maintain material equality while removing the immediate threat\n4. Comparing the options:\n- f1e2 is clearly bad (loses the king)\n- h5d1 loses material\n- g5c1 is the only move that both gets out of check and maintains material balance\n5. After g5c1, possible continuation:\n- Bxc1 Qxg6\n- Bxg6 and White is fine\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5c1\n```"
