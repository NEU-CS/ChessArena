When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: King, Rook, 2 pawns (a4, g3), h2 pawn\n- Black: King, Bishop, pawn (c7, b4, h6)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a more active rook and better pawn structure.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- White's rook is very active on b5\n- Black's bishop is somewhat passive on e7\n- White has a passed a-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) b5b6 - attacks the black king directly, forcing it to move\nb) b5c5 - pins the black pawn on b4\nc) f5e6 - centralizing the king\nd) a4a5 - advancing the passed pawn\n4. Analysis of b5b6:\n- b5b6 forces Kc6xb6 (only legal move)\n- Then Kf5-e6, and White's king can support the a-pawn's advance\n- Black's bishop can't stop both the a-pawn and potential rook checks\n- This seems very strong as it forces Black's king away from the defense\n5. Other moves:\n- b5c5 is tempting but after ...b4-b3, Black gets counterplay\n- f5e6 is solid but doesn't maximize our advantage\n- a4a5 is good but not as forcing as b5b6\n6. Conclusion:\nb5b6 is the most forcing move that immediately puts Black in serious trouble. It forces the black king to abandon the defense of the b4 pawn and allows White to quickly advance the a-pawn with king support.\n```\nb5b6\n```"
