When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a bishop and king, Black has two pawns and king.\n2. **Pawn Structure**: \n   - Black has pawns on a5 and e5\n   - White's bishop is light-squared (on c6), so it can't control the dark squares where Black's pawns are (a5 and e5)\n3. **King Positions**:\n   - White king is on g5\n   - Black king is on e3\n4. **Key Observations**:\n   - Black's pawn on a5 is unstoppable (bishop can't control a5)\n   - Black's e-pawn is blockable by the bishop\n   - White's king is close to Black's e-pawn\n5. **Goal**: We need to stop Black's e-pawn from queening while our bishop can't stop the a-pawn.\n6. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - Bishop moves: We should try to control e8 to prevent e-pawn promotion\n   - King moves: We should bring the king closer to the e-pawn\n7. **Best Move**: `c6e8` - this puts the bishop on e8 where it can:\n   - Block the e-pawn's promotion square\n   - The bishop can't be captured (Black king is too far)\n   - Even though a-pawn will queen, we can then sacrifice bishop for e-pawn and hope for a draw\nOther options:\n- King moves don't help stop either pawn\n- Other bishop moves don't control e8\n- `c6d5` would block e-pawn temporarily but king can push it\nFinal decision: `c6e8` is the only move that gives any chance to stop one pawn.\n```\nc6e8\n```"
