When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen on c6 is very powerful\n- Black has a bishop on f5 controlling important squares\n- Black's queen on d2 is threatening White's f2 pawn\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qxf2+ winning a pawn\n- Black's rook on d4 is very active\n- Black has potential threats with ...g3 after ...Qxf2+\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Qe8+ - forcing the king to move, but after ...Kg7, not clear follow-up\nb) Qd7 - attacking the rook on d4, but Black can play ...Qxf2+\nc) Qf6 - attacking f7 pawn, but allows ...Qxf2+\nd) Qe6 - blocks the bishop's diagonal, but still allows ...Qxf2+\ne) f3 - defends f2 but weakens e3 square\nf) Qxf5 - sacrifices queen for bishop but removes a key attacker\n5. Best move seems to be Qe8+:\n- Forces the king to move (only legal is Kg7)\n- Then we can play Qe5+ forking king and bishop\n- After ...Kh6, we have Qxf5 winning the bishop\n- Black's position collapses as their king is too exposed\nThis sequence wins material while keeping the initiative.\nThe immediate Qe8+ is strongest as it forces the king into a vulnerable position and leads to material gain.\n```\nc6e8\n```"
