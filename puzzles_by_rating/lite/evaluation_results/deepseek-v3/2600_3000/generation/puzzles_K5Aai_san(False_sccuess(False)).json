When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and queen vs Black's rook, bishop, knight and queen. Material is equal.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has strong pressure on the kingside with queen on h4 and bishop on g5\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- White's rook on d5 is very active\n- Black has a knight on c4 that's well placed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4h7: Immediate queen sacrifice looks tempting but after ...Qxh7, Rxh7 Kxh7, we reach an unclear position\n- g5f6: Bishop sacrifice to open up Black's king. After ...Bxf6, Qxf6 threatens mate on g7\n- d5f5: Rook lift to increase pressure on f-file\n- f3e5: Knight move attacking f7 and c6\n4. Deepest analysis:\nThe most forcing and promising line is g5f6:\n- g5f6 Bxf6 (forced, as ...gxf6 allows Qxh7#)\n- Qxf6 now threatens Qxg7#\nBlack's only defense is ...Rg8, but then:\n- Qxh6! and Black is in big trouble:\n  - If ...Rxg2+, Kxg2 Qg5+ Kh1 and White is winning\n  - If ...Qe5, Qh7+ Kf8 Qh8+ Ke7 Qxg8 wins material\n5. Other moves like h4h7 or d5f5 are interesting but not as immediately crushing as the bishop sacrifice.\n6. The bishop sacrifice leads to a forced win of material or mate, while maintaining all of White's attacking potential.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5f6\n```"
