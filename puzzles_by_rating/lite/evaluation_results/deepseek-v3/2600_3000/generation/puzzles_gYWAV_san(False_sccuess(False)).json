When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the material balance:\n- White has Rook, Queen, Bishop vs Black's Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n2. Key observations about the position:\n- White's Queen on d4 is very strong, eyeing the black king\n- Black's king is exposed on h7\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's e4 pawn is weak and could be a target\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxe4 winning a pawn\n- White could also play Qf6 with strong attacking ideas\n- Black needs to address these threats while improving his position\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7d7 (Queen defends e4 and connects rooks)\n- e7e6 (Rook defends e4 but blocks bishop)\n- c6d5 (Bishop move, but allows Qxe4)\n- b7c7 (Queen defends e4 but blocks bishop)\n5. Best move seems to be b7d7 because:\n- Defends the e4 pawn directly\n- Connects the rooks\n- Keeps the queen active\n- Doesn't block any pieces\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\nOther options have drawbacks:\n- e7e6 blocks the bishop's diagonal\n- b7c7 blocks the bishop and makes the queen less active\n- Moving the rook elsewhere leaves e4 undefended\nThe move b7d7 solidifies Black's position while maintaining piece activity and coordination.\n```\nb7d7\n```"
