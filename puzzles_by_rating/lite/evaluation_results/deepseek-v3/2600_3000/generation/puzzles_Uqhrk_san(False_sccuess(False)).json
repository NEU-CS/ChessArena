When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, bishop, knight, rook, 4 pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, bishop, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White may be slightly better due to more active pieces)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen and bishop are very active on g6 and h6\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that could be dangerous\n- White's knight on d2 is somewhat passive\n3. Threats and opportunities:\n- White has potential mating threats with the queen and bishop battery\n- Black's queen on d7 is defending key squares\n- The immediate threat is Qg7# if Black's queen is distracted\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Qg7+ (g6g7) - forces Qxg7, then Bxg7+ Kxg7 and we've traded queens\nb) Qe8+ (g6e8) - threatens mate, but Black can play Qxe8\nc) Qh7+ (g6h7) - forces Kxh7, then Bf8+ with perpetual check\nd) Bf8 (h6f8) - threatens Qg7#, but Black can defend with Qe7\ne) Nxc4 (d2c4) - eliminates a pawn but doesn't address the mating threats\n5. Best continuation:\nThe most forcing line is Qh7+ (g6h7), leading to:\n- Kxh7 (forced)\n- Bf8+ Kh8\n- Bg7+ Kg8\n- Bf6+ with perpetual check\nThis guarantees at least a draw, and Black cannot avoid it. Other moves either allow Black counterplay or don't maximize White's attacking potential.\nThe move is:\n```\ng6h7\n```"
