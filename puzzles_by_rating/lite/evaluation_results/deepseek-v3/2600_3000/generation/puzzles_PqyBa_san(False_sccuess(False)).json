When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Here's the FEN: `8/P3R2p/6p1/4k3/4N1P1/8/1r2p3/4K1n1 b - - 5 45`\nFirst, let's visualize the position:\nBlack to move (we're Black, with king at e5)\nWhite has:\n- Pawn on a7\n- Rook on e7\n- Knight on e4\n- Pawn on g4\n- King on e1\nBlack has:\n- Pawn on h7\n- Pawns on g6 and e2\n- Rook on b2\n- Knight on g1\n- King on e5\nLegal moves for Black's king: e5d5, e5f4, e5d4\nLet's evaluate each option:\n1. e5d5:\n   - Moves king towards center\n   - But white's rook on e7 could check on e5 next move\n   - Doesn't address immediate threats\n2. e5f4:\n   - Attacks white's pawn on g4\n   - But puts king on same diagonal as white's knight (e4-g2)\n   - White could play Nf2+ forking our king and rook\n   - Seems dangerous\n3. e5d4:\n   - Moves king towards our passed pawn on e2\n   - Protects e2 pawn which is about to promote\n   - Gets away from potential rook checks\n   - Covers c5 square against white's knight\nThe most pressing issue is our e2 pawn which is about to promote. After e5d4:\n- If white takes our e2 pawn with Rxe2, we can play Kxe2 and be up material\n- If white doesn't take, we can push e2e1=Q next move\n- It also prevents any potential knight checks\ne5f4 seems too risky because of the knight fork possibility, and e5d5 doesn't address our promotion threat as effectively.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5d4\n```"
