When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop, knight, 2 pawns vs Black's rook, rook, knight, queen, 3 pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs rook)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on h1\n- Black king is exposed on b6 with potential threats\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on e3 is very active and threatening\n- White's queen on g7 is extremely powerful, controlling many squares\n- Black has doubled rooks on the d-file and g-file\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: g7h6 (attacking rook), g7f6 (attacking pawn), g7e5 (forking king and rook)\n- Knight moves: b3c5+ (forking king and queen)\n- Rook moves: f1f7 (pinning pawn to king)\n5. Best options:\n- g7h6 looks strong as it attacks the rook on g8. If rook moves, we can consider Qxg8 next.\n- b3c5+ is tempting as it forks king and queen, but after Kxc5 Qxe3, we lose the knight and the position remains unclear.\n- f1f7 pins the pawn to the king, but Black can defend with ...Rdg8.\n6. After g7h6:\n- If ...Rxh6, then Qxg8 wins a rook\n- If ...Rdg8, then Qxg8 Rxg8 Rf7 is strong with threats\n- If ...Rg7, then Qxg7 is winning\nThe most forcing and decisive move is g7h6, as it immediately wins material or leads to a decisive advantage. Other moves allow Black more counterplay.\n```\ng7h6\n```"
