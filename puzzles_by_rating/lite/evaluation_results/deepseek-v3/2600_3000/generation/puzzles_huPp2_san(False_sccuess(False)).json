When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: rook (f8), rook (e8), knight (d7), queen (f6), pawns (a7, b6, d6, f5, h6)\n- White has: rook (a1), rook (f1), queen (c6), bishop (c2), pawns (a3, c4, d4, f2, h2)\n- Material is roughly equal (Black might be slightly better with two rooks vs rook+bishop)\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on c6 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king on h7 is somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rooks are currently not very active\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxd6, winning a pawn\n- White could play Qb7, attacking the a7 pawn\n- White could play Rfd1, increasing pressure on the d-file\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6g7: Protects the king and maintains queen's activity\n- f6f7: Blocks the e-file and defends d6\n- e8e7: Doubles rooks and defends d6\n- d7e5: Develops the knight to a more active square\n5. Best move analysis:\n- f6g7 seems most prudent, as it:\n  - Protects the king from potential checks\n  - Maintains the queen's active position\n  - Doesn't allow White to win material (like Qxd6)\n  - Keeps options open for future play\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- f6f7 blocks the rook's activity\n- e8e7 leaves the queen vulnerable\n- d7e5 allows Qxd6\n6. Potential follow-ups after f6g7:\n- Black can consider ...Rf8-f7 to reinforce the defense\n- Or ...d6-d5 to challenge White's center\n- Or ...a7-a5 to gain space on the queenside\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\nf6g7\n```"
