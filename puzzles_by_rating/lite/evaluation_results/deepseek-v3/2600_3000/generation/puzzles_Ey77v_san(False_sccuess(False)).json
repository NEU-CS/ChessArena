When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has Rook (a4), Rook (h4), Bishop (f4), Bishop (h3), Queen (g1), King (c1), and pawns (b3, d5, e4, g5)\n- Black has Queen (b5), Rook (c7), Bishop (f7), Knight (g4), King (g8), and pawns (c3, d6, g6, g7)\n- Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two bishops)\n2. Key features:\n- White has strong control of the h-file with doubled rooks\n- Black's knight on g4 is somewhat loose\n- Black's queen is very active on b5\n- White's bishop pair could become powerful in an open position\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that could be dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4h7: Immediate rook sacrifice to expose the black king\n- f4g3: Capturing the knight and opening the h-file\n- g1g4: Queen sacrifice to win the knight\n- a4a8: Rook lift to threaten back rank\n- e4e5: Pawn push to open lines\n4. Deep analysis:\n- h4h7 looks very tempting: after h4h7 g7h7, h3g4 wins the knight and opens the h-file\n- f4g3 is solid: after f4g3 h3g4, we win the knight but lose the bishop pair\n- g1g4 is interesting but after qxg4 hxg4, black gets counterplay with the queen off\n- a4a8 is slow and allows black to defend\n- e4e5 doesn't accomplish much immediately\n5. Best move:\nh4h7 is the most forcing and strongest move. It leads to material gain while opening the h-file for a strong attack against the black king. After:\n- h4h7 g7h7\n- h3g4 (winning the knight)\nBlack can't recapture because of the pin (h7 is pinned to the king by the rook on h1)\nThis leads to a clear advantage for White with an active position and material gain.\n```\nh4h7\n```"
