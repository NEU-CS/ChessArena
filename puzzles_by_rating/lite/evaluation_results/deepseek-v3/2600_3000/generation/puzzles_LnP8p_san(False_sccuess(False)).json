When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight\n- White is down a knight but has better coordinated pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b6 is very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5 that could become dangerous\n- White's queen on a5 is eyeing the weak f5 square (after potential exchanges)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) b6b7 - attacking the rook on c7 and potentially doubling rooks\nb) a5a8 - pinning the queen to the king\nc) b1h7 - bishop sacrifice to expose the black king\nd) b6e6 - attacking the pawn and potentially clearing lines\n4. Deep analysis:\n- b6b7 looks strong as it threatens Rxc7 Qxc7 Qxf5 with a strong attack\n- a5a8 pins the queen but after ...Qxa8 Rxa8 Kf7 Black can defend\n- b1h7 is tempting but after Kxh7 Qxf5+ Kg8 Qxe6+ Kh8 the attack may fizzle out\n- b6e6 fxe6 Qxe6+ Kh8 and Black can defend\n5. Best continuation:\nb6b7 is the most forcing move:\n- If Rxb7 Qxb7 Qc3 (trying to defend) Qxf7+ Kh8 Qxe6 and White is winning\n- If Black doesn't take, White can double rooks with Ra1-a8 next\nThe move b6b7 creates immediate threats while maintaining all of White's positional advantages.\n```\nb6b7\n```"
