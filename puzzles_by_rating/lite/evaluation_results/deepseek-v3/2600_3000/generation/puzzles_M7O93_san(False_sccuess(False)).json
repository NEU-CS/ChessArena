When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Here's the FEN: `8/8/2p2k1P/ppP2p2/2pP1K2/P1P5/8/8 b - - 0 45`\nFirst, let's visualize the position:\n- Black king at f6\n- White king at f4\n- Black pawns: a5, b5, c6, c4, f5\n- White pawns: a3, c3, c5, d4, h6\n- It's Black's turn to move\nKey observations:\n1. This is a pawn endgame where king activity is crucial.\n2. White has a passed pawn on h6 that could be dangerous.\n3. Black has a passed pawn on c4 that's currently blocked by White's d4 pawn.\n4. The position is very blocked with many pawns fixed against each other.\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n1. **f6f7 (King moves forward)**\n   - Advances the king toward White's pawns\n   - But leaves the h6 pawn undefended\n   - White can play Kg5 attacking f5 pawn\n   - Not ideal\n2. **f6e7 (King moves left)**\n   - Gets closer to the queenside pawns\n   - But still leaves h6 pawn undefended\n   - White can push h7 winning the pawn\n   - Not good\n3. **f6g6 (King moves toward h6 pawn)**\n   - Directly challenges the h6 pawn\n   - After Kxh6, Kxf5 and White's king is too active\n   - This would be bad for Black\n4. **f6e6 (King moves left)**\n   - Centralizes the king\n   - Prepares to support the c4 pawn\n   - Keeps options to go to d5 or f5\n   - Best option so far\n5. **b5b4 (Pawn push)**\n   - Opens the b-file but doesn't achieve much\n   - After axb4, axb4 and position remains blocked\n   - Doesn't improve Black's position\n6. **a5a4 (Pawn push)**\n   - Further blocks the position\n   - But doesn't create any threats\n   - White can just maintain the position\nAfter careful consideration, **f6e6** is the best move because:\n- It centralizes the king\n- Prepares to support the c4 pawn\n- Maintains flexibility to go to d5 or f5 as needed\n- Doesn't allow White any immediate counterplay\n- Keeps the position balanced\nAll other moves either allow White counterplay or don't improve Black's position.\n```\nf6e6\n```"
