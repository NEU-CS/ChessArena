When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: King, Bishop, 2 pawns\n- Black has: King, Bishop, 2 pawns\nMaterial is equal (both sides have minor pieces and equal pawns)\n2. Pawn structure:\n- White has pawns on f2 and f5\n- Black has pawns on b7 and h5\n- White's f5 pawn is more advanced but isolated\n- Black's h5 pawn is passed but blocked by White's f2 pawn\n3. King positions:\n- White king is on e4\n- Black king is on g4 (more active, closer to the action)\n4. Bishop evaluation:\n- White has a light-squared bishop on e1\n- Black has a dark-squared bishop on g1\n- Both bishops are active but control different squares\nNow let's evaluate the candidate moves:\na) g4g5 - King moves forward\n- Gains space but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Might help support the h5 pawn later\n- But allows White to play Ke5 next move\nb) g4h4 - King moves toward the h-file\n- Eyes the h5 pawn for potential support\n- But doesn't create any immediate threats\n- White can respond with Ke5 or f3\nc) g4h3 - King moves aggressively\n- Threatens to capture the f2 pawn next move\n- But exposes the king to potential checks\n- White could respond with Bf2 pinning the h5 pawn\nd) g1h2 - Bishop moves\n- Attacks the f2 pawn\n- But allows White to play f6, advancing the pawn\n- Not particularly threatening\ne) g1f2 - Bishop moves\n- Attacks the f2 pawn directly\n- But after Kxf2, Black's bishop is lost\n- This would be a bad trade\nf) b7b6 - Pawn moves\n- Doesn't accomplish much\n- Gives White more options\ng) h5h4 - Pawn advances\n- Creates a passed pawn\n- But the pawn is blocked by f2\n- White can respond with f3 or Ke5\nh) b7b5 - Pawn advances\n- Gains space on the queenside\n- Creates potential for a passed pawn\n- Doesn't immediately help the kingside\nThe best move appears to be g4h3 because:\n1. It threatens to capture the f2 pawn next move (h3xg2)\n2. It brings the king closer to the action\n3. It maintains pressure on White's position\n4. White's responses are limited (Bf2 is met with Bxf2, Kxf2, and Black can push h4)\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to improve their position. g4h3 is the most aggressive and principled move in this position.\n```\ng4h3\n```"
