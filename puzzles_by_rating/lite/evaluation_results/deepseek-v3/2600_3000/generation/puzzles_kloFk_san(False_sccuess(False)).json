When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (b8), Rook (b6), Queen (a5), Knight (d5), pawns (a7, c3, f5, g7)\n- White has: Rook (g1), Rook (d1), Queen (d1), pawns (a3, b3, d4, h6, c2)\n- Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n- Black has two rooks on the b-file putting pressure\n- Black's queen is very active on a5\n- White has a passed pawn on h6 that could be dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- Black's rook on b6 is attacking White's pawn on b3\n- Black's knight has several active squares\n- Black can consider doubling rooks on the b-file\n4. Candidate moves:\na) b6b3 - Immediate capture of the pawn, but after c2xb3, White gets some counterplay\nb) d5f4 - Centralizing the knight, attacking d4 pawn\nc) a5a4 - Advancing the queen to maintain pressure\nd) b8b7 - Doubling rooks on the b-file\nAfter careful consideration:\n- b6b3 is tempting but gives White counterplay\n- d5f4 is solid but doesn't maximize our pressure\n- a5a4 is good but we can do better\n- b8b7 is the most promising, doubling rooks and maintaining all our threats\nThe best move is to double rooks on the b-file, maintaining maximum pressure on White's position while keeping all options open. This prepares for potential sacrifices on b3 in the future while keeping all pieces active.\n```\nb8b7\n```"
