When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (c8), Rook (e8), Bishop (c7), 5 pawns\n- White has: Rook (a1), Rook (f3), Bishop (g7), 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on g7 is very strong, pinning the f7 pawn to the king\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that could become dangerous\n- Black has a central pawn majority (c5, d5)\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rf3-f7, attacking the pinned pawn\n- White might push f6-f7, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- White's rook on a1 could swing to the kingside\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8h7: Gets the king away from potential checks, but into a potential pin\n- e8e7: Defends f7 and prepares to double rooks\n- c7d8: Blocks potential rook checks on the back rank\n- c5d4: Creates a passed pawn but opens lines\n5. Best move analysis:\n- g8h7 looks risky as it walks into potential discovered attacks\n- e8e7 is solid, defending f7 and preparing to activate the rook\n- c7d8 is passive and blocks the rook\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threats\nThe best move is e8e7, which:\n- Defends the f7 pawn against Rf7 ideas\n- Prepares to double rooks on the e-file\n- Keeps options open for both rooks\n- Maintains flexibility in the position\nHere's the move:\n```\ne8e7\n```"
