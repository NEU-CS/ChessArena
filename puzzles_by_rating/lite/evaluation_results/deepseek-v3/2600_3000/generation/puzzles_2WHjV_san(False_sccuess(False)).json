When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n- White has: pawn on a6, c4; knight on f3; rook on h2; queen on b1; king on f1\n- Black has: pawns on c5, e3, f5, g5, h5; queen on g3; rook on d2; bishop on f2; king on g8\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed but White's king is also very vulnerable\n- Black has a strong passed pawn on e3 that's close to promotion\n- White's a-pawn is advanced but currently blocked\n- Black's queen is very active on g3, eyeing multiple squares\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qb1xb7 or Qb1-e4\n- Black can create immediate threats with the queen\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3h2: Queen takes rook, but after Rxh2, we lose our active queen\n- g3g2: Threatening mate on g1, but White can play Qb1xg2\n- d2d1: Promoting the rook to a queen with check (but White can block with Qb1-d1)\n- f2g1: Bishop takes knight with discovered check (interesting)\n- g3b8: Queen swing to b8, threatening the a-pawn\n5. Best move analysis:\n- f2g1 looks very strong because:\n  - It's a discovered check on the king\n  - After Kxg1, we can play Qg3xh2 with a winning material advantage\n  - Even if White tries Qb1xg1, we have Qg3xg1+ Kf1xg1 d2xd1 with a winning endgame\n6. Other options are less convincing:\n- Queen moves allow White counterplay\n- Rook promotions can be blocked\n- Pawn moves don't create immediate threats\nThe move f2g1 creates the most forcing sequence that leads to a decisive material advantage. After Kxg1 Qxh2, Black is completely winning.\n```\nf2g1\n```"
