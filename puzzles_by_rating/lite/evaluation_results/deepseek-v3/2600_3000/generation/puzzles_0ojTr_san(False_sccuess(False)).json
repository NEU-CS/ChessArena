When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have pawns only. Black has 3 pawns (a7, b7, h6) vs White's 3 pawns (b5, c5, g4). The material is equal.\n2. King positions: Black's king is at e6, White's king is at d4. Both kings are active in the pawn endgame.\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - Black has a passed pawn on h6\n   - White has connected passed pawns on b5 and c5\n   - The g-pawns are opposed (g4 vs g5)\n4. Key observations:\n   - White's connected passed pawns are dangerous but currently blockaded\n   - Black's h-pawn is a potential threat\n   - The position is very delicate as any king move could change the evaluation\nNow let's evaluate the candidate moves:\na) e6f7 - Moves king away from center, allows White's king to advance\nb) e6e7 - Keeps king active but doesn't accomplish much\nc) e6d7 - Challenges White's king, best centralizing move\nd) e6f6 - Puts king on same file as White's g-pawn, not ideal\ne) b7b6 - Creates a passed pawn but gives up the b7 pawn\nf) a7a6 - Doesn't accomplish much\ng) h6h5 - Creates a passed pawn but loses the h-pawn\nh) a7a5 - Creates a passed pawn but loses the a-pawn\nThe best move is e6d7 because:\n1. It centralizes the king\n2. It prevents White's king from advancing (e.g. Kd4-c4 would now be met with Kd7-c6)\n3. It maintains flexibility to go after either side's pawns\n4. It keeps the blockade on White's connected passed pawns\nOther moves either weaken Black's position or don't improve it. For example:\n- b7b6 would lose a pawn after cxb6\n- h6h5 would lose the h-pawn after gxh5\n- King moves to f7 or e7 are less active than d7\n```\ne6d7\n```"
