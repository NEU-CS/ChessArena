When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: Queen, Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns\n- Black: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slightly more with queen vs queen but Black has extra pawn)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on f2\n- Black king is somewhat exposed on h8\nBoth sides have attacking chances\n3. Key features:\n- White has a strong centralized queen on e6\n- Black's queen on h7 is somewhat passive\n- White's pawn on e5 is passed and strong\n- Black has some counterplay with the c4 pawn\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: e6g8 (threatening mate), e6f7 (attacking queen)\n- Bishop moves: c2g6 (attacking queen)\n- Rook moves: g1g2 (defending king)\n- Pawn moves: f4f5 (pushing passed pawn)\n5. Analysis of best options:\n- e6g8 looks very strong: threatens Qg7# and if Black defends with Qg7, then Qxg7+ Kxg7, Rg1+ wins the rook\n- e6f7 Qxf7 Rxf7 is possible but less forcing\n- c2g6 Qxg6 Qxg6 is equal material exchange\n- Other moves don't create immediate threats\n6. Forcing line after e6g8:\n- If 32...Qg7 33.Qxg7+ Kxg7 34.Rg1+ Kh7 35.Rxg6 wins material\n- If 32...Rg8 33.Qxh7+ Kxh7 34.Rg1 with strong attack\n- If 32...Kh8 33.Qf7 threatening mate\nThe move e6g8 creates the most immediate threats and wins material by force. All other options either don't create threats or allow Black counterplay.\n```\ne6g8\n```"
