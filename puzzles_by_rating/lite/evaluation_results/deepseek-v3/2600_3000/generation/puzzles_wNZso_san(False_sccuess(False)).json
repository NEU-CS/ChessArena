When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (c5), Bishop (f4), pawns (b6, c3, h5, f2)\n- Black has: Rook (d7), Knight (d6), pawns (b7, b5, f6, g7, h6)\n- Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop pair potential)\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on c5 is very active, controlling the 5th rank\n- Black's knight is somewhat restricted by white pawns\n- White's bishop is well placed on f4, eyeing black's kingside\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- Both sides have passed pawns (White's b6, Black's b5)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e4: Knight jumps forward, attacking white's bishop\n- d7e7: Rook moves to defend the e-file\n- f7e7: King moves to centralize\n- b5b4: Advances the passed pawn\n4. Analysis of d6e4:\n- After d6e4, white can play Bxe4 Rxe4, but this trades bishop for rook which is bad\n- White might play Kxe4, but then Rxd7 is strong for black\n- Or white could retreat the bishop, maintaining pressure\n5. Analysis of d7e7:\n- This defends the e-file and connects rooks\n- But it doesn't create any threats\n- White can continue improving position\n6. Analysis of f7e7:\n- Centralizes the king\n- But exposes it to potential checks\n- Not immediately helpful\n7. Analysis of b5b4:\n- Advances the passed pawn\n- Creates immediate threat\n- After cxb4, black can play Rxb7 with good counterplay\nAfter considering all options, d6e4 seems most active, creating immediate threats and forcing white to react. The knight fork on e4 attacks both the bishop and the c3 pawn, and white doesn't have a completely satisfactory way to respond.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd6e4\n```"
