When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Count**: \n   - White has king + bishop + pawns\n   - Black has king + knight + pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal (bishop vs knight with equal pawns)\n2. **Pawn Structure**:\n   - White has passed pawns on c4 and d5\n   - Black has connected pawns on c5 and d6\n   - White's g4 pawn is blocked by Black's g5 pawn\n3. **King Position**:\n   - White king is on a4 (somewhat exposed)\n   - Black king is on e5 (very active and centralized)\n4. **Key Observations**:\n   - Black's knight is well-placed on f6, controlling key squares\n   - White's bishop is currently very active on f5\n   - Black's king is threatening to capture the d5 pawn\n5. **Candidate Moves Analysis**:\n   - **Bishop moves**: Most bishop moves would lose the bishop to the knight (f5g6 Nxg4) or king (f5e6 Kxe6)\n   - **King moves**:\n     - a4b5: Would block the c-pawn's advance and expose king\n     - a4a5: Advances king but doesn't address immediate threats\n     - a4b3: Best king move - retreats to safer square while keeping options open\n6. **Critical Threat**:\n   - Black is threatening Kxd5, winning a pawn\n   - After Kxd5, White can't recapture (bishop is pinned to king)\n   - Need to protect d5 pawn or create counterplay\n7. **Best Move**:\n   - a4b3 is the safest choice:\n     - Gets king to safer square\n     - Maintains all options\n     - Doesn't create any weaknesses\n     - Prepares to possibly support the c-pawn's advance later\nOther moves either lose material or create worse problems. For example:\n- f5g6 Nxg4 loses a pawn\n- f5e6 Kxe6 loses the bishop\n- a4b5 blocks the c-pawn and exposes king\n```\na4b3\n```"
