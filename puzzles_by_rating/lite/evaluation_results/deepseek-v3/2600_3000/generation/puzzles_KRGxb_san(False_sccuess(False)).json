When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

First, let's understand the material balance and position:\n- Black has a queen (d7), knight (c5), pawns (b6, g6, h5), and king (g7)\n- White has a queen (b2), bishop (c2), pawns (e3, f2, g2), and king (f1)\n- Black is up a knight but White has some compensation with active pieces\n2. Evaluating the candidate moves:\n- g7g8/g7f8: King moves seem too passive and don't improve our position\n- g7h7: Also passive, though might be safer\n- g7h6: Interesting, brings king closer to center but exposes it\n- d7d4: Queen move attacking e3 pawn and gaining space\n- f7f6: Solid move, reinforcing g6 pawn and creating luft for king\n3. Key considerations:\n- White's queen and bishop are well placed to create threats\n- We need to maintain our material advantage while being careful about tactics\n- The e3 pawn is a potential target\n- King safety is important\n4. Best options seem to be:\n- d7d4: Puts pressure on e3 pawn and gains space\n- f7f6: Solid defensive move creating luft\nBetween these, f7f6 is more solid as it:\n- Creates an escape square for the king\n- Prevents any potential back rank issues\n- Doesn't expose our queen to any tactics\n- Maintains all our advantages\nd7d4 is playable but might allow White some counterplay after Qb3 or similar moves.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf7f6\n```"
