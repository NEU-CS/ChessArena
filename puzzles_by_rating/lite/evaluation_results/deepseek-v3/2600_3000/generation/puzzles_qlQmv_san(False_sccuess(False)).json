When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

First, let's understand the position:\n- Black is in check from White's queen on f4\n- Black king is on h6\n- Black has a rook on a8, pawns on a7, b7, g7\n- White has a queen on f4, pawns on a3, c3, bishop on b2, king on g2\n- White's queen is attacking our king while also threatening our rook on a8\n2. Looking at the legal moves:\n- h6h7: moves king to h7, but then Qf4xh7 is mate\n- h6g6: moves king to g6, but Qf4xg5 is mate\n- h6h5: moves king to h5, but Qf4-h4 is mate\n- g7g5: pawn blocks the check by moving to g5\n3. The only move that doesn't immediately lose is g7g5, which blocks the check by interposing the pawn. After g7g5:\n- White can take the pawn with Qf4xg5+, but then our king can escape to h7\n- White might play other moves, but at least we survive the immediate threat\n4. All other king moves lead to immediate checkmate, so g7g5 is forced.\nTherefore, the best and only viable move is:\n```\ng7g5\n```"
