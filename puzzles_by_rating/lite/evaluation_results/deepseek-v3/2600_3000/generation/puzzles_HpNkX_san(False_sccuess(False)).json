When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has queen, bishop, rook, 3 pawns\n- White has queen, rook, knight, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but Black has some positional pressure.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on c3 is very active, attacking White's knight on f3\n- White has doubled rooks on the b-file (b1 and b5)\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on e7\n- White has a passed pawn on g6 that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c3xf3: Capturing the knight seems tempting as it removes a defender\n- h8g8: Bringing the rook to a more central position\n- e7d6: Moving the king to a safer square\n- a7b7: Protecting the queen while keeping pressure\n4. Deep analysis of c3xf3:\n- After Qxf3, White can play Qxf3, but then Black can play Bxh2+! (sacrificing the bishop)\n- After Kxh2, Qh7+ wins the queen back with a better position\n- If White doesn't take the bishop, Black maintains strong pressure\n5. Other moves:\n- h8g8 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- e7d6 is defensive but allows White to consolidate\n- a7b7 is too passive\n6. Conclusion:\nCapturing the knight with c3xf3 creates the most immediate threats and tactical possibilities. The bishop sacrifice on h2 is particularly dangerous for White.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc3f3\n```"
