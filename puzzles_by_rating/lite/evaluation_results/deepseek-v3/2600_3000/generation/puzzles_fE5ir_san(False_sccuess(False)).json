When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White: N+N+B vs Black: B+B+N). However, White has a more active knight on h7 threatening Black's king.\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on d8 with only a rook covering it. White's king is safer on c1.\n3. Key threats: White's knight on h7 is very dangerous. Black has threats with their bishop pair and queen battery (queen on c7, bishop on e5).\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7f8: Knight forks king and rook, but Black can play Qxf8\n- h7f6: Knight forks queen and bishop, but after exf6 White loses the knight\n- e4f6: Another knight fork attempt, but Black can take with exf6\n- d3a6: Bishop move attacking pawn, but not very forcing\n- c2e2: Queen move pinning the e5 bishop to the king\nAfter evaluating:\n- h7f8 seems most forcing: After 1. Nf8 Qxf8 2. Qxe5+ Be6 3. Qxf8+ Rxf8, White wins the exchange (rook for bishop)\n- Other knight moves either lose material or don't create enough threats\n- The queen moves don't create immediate threats\nThe best move is h7f8, as it forces Black to give up material to avoid worse consequences. Even though White loses the knight, they gain a rook in return.\n```\nh7f8\n```"
