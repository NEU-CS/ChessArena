When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: 2 Rooks, Queen, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with knight vs pawn)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on g1\n- Black king is in a precarious position on c7, exposed to potential checks\n3. Key threats:\n- White's queen on a5 is eyeing the e1 square which could lead to discovered checks\n- Black's queen is somewhat trapped on b7\n- Black's rooks are doubled but not very active\nNow evaluating the legal moves:\na) c7b8 (King moves to b8):\n- Gets the king away from potential checks\n- But leaves the queen on b7 hanging to the knight on a7\n- After Nxb7, Rxb7, White can play Qd8+ with strong initiative\nb) c7d7 (King moves to d7):\n- Keeps the king more centralized\n- Still leaves queen vulnerable to Nxb7\n- After Nxb7, Rxb7, Qd8+ is still possible\n- King is more exposed to potential checks\nc) b7b6 (Queen moves to b6):\n- Protects the queen by moving it away\n- Covers the d8 square against potential checks\n- Maintains pressure on white's position\n- After Qb6, if Nxb6, cxb6 and black's position holds\nThe best move is b7b6 because:\n1. It saves the queen from being trapped\n2. It prevents immediate tactical threats\n3. It maintains some counterplay potential\n4. The other king moves leave the queen vulnerable and don't solve the main problem\n```\nb7b6\n```"
