When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: King, Bishop, Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: King, Bishop, Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\nMaterial is equal, but White has better piece coordination.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on e6 is very strong, eyeing the black king\n- Black's bishop on g7 is blocked by its own pawn on h6\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on b4 that could be advanced\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens Qxc2, but this would lose the queen to Rf8+\n- White can consider several forcing moves\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) e6g8 - Bishop sacrifice to expose the king\nb) f4f8 - Rook lift to attack the king\nc) c2f5 - Queen move attacking the bishop and pawn\nd) b4b5 - Pawn push to create a passed pawn\n5. Analysis of e6g8:\n- e6g8 Bxg8\n- Rf8+ Kh7\n- Qxg8+ Kxg8\n- Rf7 attacking the bishop and pawn\nThis leads to a winning endgame for White\n6. Analysis of f4f8:\n- f4f8 Qxf8\n- Bxf8 Kxf8\nLeads to a roughly equal endgame\n7. Analysis of c2f5:\n- c2f5 Qxc5\n- bxc5 Bxc5\nLeads to unclear position\n8. Analysis of b4b5:\n- b4b5 cxb5\n- cxb5 creates a passed pawn but gives Black counterplay\nThe bishop sacrifice e6g8 is the most forcing and leads to a clear advantage. After Bxg8 Rf8+ Kh7 Qxg8+ Kxg8 Rf7, White wins material and has a strong passed g-pawn.\n```\ne6g8\n```"
