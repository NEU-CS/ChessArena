When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully.\nCurrent position analysis:\n- Black has a rook on a8, pawns on a3 and e6\n- White has a rook on a1, pawns on g7 and h4, king on h2\n- Black king is on e4\n- White's g7 pawn is about to promote (only 1 square away)\n- It's Black's move (b in FEN)\nKey observations:\n1. White's g7 pawn is extremely dangerous - if it promotes, White will have a decisive advantage.\n2. Black's king is somewhat exposed but can still move.\n3. Black's rook is currently passive on a8.\n4. White's rook on a1 is controlling the a-file.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. a8g8 - this would block the pawn's promotion path\n2. e4f5 - king moves towards the action\n3. a3a2 - advancing the pawn\nLet's evaluate each:\n1. a8g8:\n- Immediately stops the pawn from promoting\n- But after g8, White can play h4h5, then h5h6, creating another passed pawn\n- Black's rook would be tied down to g8\n2. e4f5:\n- King moves towards the pawn\n- But White can immediately promote with g7g8q\n- After g8q, Black has no good way to stop the queen's power\n3. a3a2:\n- Advances Black's pawn\n- But again, White promotes with g7g8q with decisive advantage\nThe best move is clearly a8g8, as it's the only move that prevents immediate promotion. While it's not perfect (White can create another passed pawn), it's the only way to prolong the game.\nOther moves allow immediate promotion which would be catastrophic. After a8g8, Black can try to activate the king and create counterplay with the a-pawn.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na8g8\n```"
