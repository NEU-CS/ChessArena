When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal (Black has R+B vs White's 2R+N, but White has more pawns)\n2. Black's king is somewhat exposed on h7\n3. White's king is on c4, which is quite active\n4. Black has a strong bishop on h5 eyeing the white king\n5. Both sides have passed pawns (Black's a7, White's b3/b2)\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h5g4 - Bishop moves closer to king, threatens f3\n2. g3g5 - Rook moves to 5th rank, could be useful\n3. f4f3 - Advances passed pawn, but blocks bishop\n4. f7f5 - Rook moves to central file\nLet's evaluate:\n- h5g4 looks tempting as it brings the bishop closer to the white king and threatens to play ...f3 next, but after Kd3 the bishop might get trapped.\n- g3g5 seems more flexible - it centralizes the rook and maintains pressure. From g5 it can swing to e5 or c5 to attack the white king or support the a-pawn.\n- f4f3 is premature as it blocks the bishop's diagonal and doesn't achieve much immediately.\n- f7f5 is passive and doesn't improve the rook's position.\nBetween h5g4 and g3g5, g3g5 seems more solid and flexible. It keeps all options open while improving the rook's position. The bishop is already well placed on h5.\nAfter g3g5, possible ideas:\n- If White plays Kd3, we can consider ...f3 or ...Rc5\n- The rook can swing to e5 to attack the e6 knight\n- It maintains pressure on the b3 pawn\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng3g5\n```"
