When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: King, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has: King, Knight, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (bishop vs knight with equal pawns)\n2. Pawn structure:\n- White has passed pawns on a4 and e5\n- Black has connected passed pawns on a5 and b4\n- Black's pawns are more advanced and dangerous\n3. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on g5\n- Black king is relatively safe on c7\n4. Immediate threats:\n- Black's b4 pawn is threatening to advance to b3\n- Black's knight can jump to d4 or e5 if given the chance\nNow evaluating the candidate moves:\na) King moves (g5h6, g5f6, g5h4):\n- All of these expose the king more without clear benefit\n- Not ideal when we have better options\nb) Bishop moves:\n- b5c6: attacks the king but allows b4b3\n- b5a6: protects a4 pawn but passive\n- b5c4: blocks the b pawn but leaves bishop vulnerable\n- b5d3: blocks b pawn but leaves bishop awkward\n- b5e2: too passive\n- b5f1: too passive\nc) Pawn moves:\n- b2b3: This is actually very strong because:\n  - It blocks Black's dangerous passed pawn\n  - Creates a passed pawn of our own on a4\n  - The bishop can now protect the b3 pawn from a6 if needed\n  - Black's knight has no good squares to attack b3\nAfter b2b3, Black's options are limited:\n- If ...a5a4 then b3xa4 and our a-pawn becomes dangerous\n- If ...Kc7b7 then we can play Ba6 to protect b3\n- If ...Nc6d4 we can play Kf6 or Kh6\nThe other moves either don't address the immediate threat or leave our position worse. b2b3 is the most principled move, stopping Black's pawn advance while creating our own passed pawn.\n```\nb2b3\n```"
