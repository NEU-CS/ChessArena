When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a rook, queen, 2 knights, bishop and 4 pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight and 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on b5\n- Black has a strong bishop on g4 pinning the knight on e4 to the queen\n- Black's queen is very active on d8\n- White's rook on a7 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n- Black has potential threats against White's king\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f6: This seems tempting to remove the pin and attack the rook, but after ...gxf6, Black's pieces become more active\n- a7g7: Challenging the rook and potentially trading down\n- b5b6: Advancing the passed pawn\n- e2f4: Defending the knight and potentially challenging the bishop\n- d2h6: Interesting sacrifice to remove the dark-squared bishop\n4. Best options:\n- b5b6 looks very strong, advancing the passed pawn and creating serious threats. Black would have to respond carefully.\n- a7g7 is solid, trading rooks and reducing Black's attacking potential\n- d2h6 is a creative sacrifice that could lead to complications\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- b5b6 is probably best, as it creates immediate pressure. After b5b6, if ...cxb6 then cxb6 and the pawn becomes very dangerous. Black would have to find precise moves to stop it.\nThe move b5b6 both advances our passed pawn and opens lines for our pieces. It creates concrete threats that Black must address immediately, while maintaining our material equality.\nHere's the move:\n```\nb5b6\n```"
