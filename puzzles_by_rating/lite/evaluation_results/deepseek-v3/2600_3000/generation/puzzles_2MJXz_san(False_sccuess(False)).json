When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, Knight, pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, Knight, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on h8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on d8\n- White has threats against the black king\n- Black has some pressure with the bishop on e4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h8g7 - Bishop retreat, not ideal\nb) g5d8 - Queen sacrifice to expose king\nc) h4f5 - Knight move attacking queen\nd) f1a6 - Bishop move with discovered attack\n4. Best move analysis:\n- g5d8! is very strong:\n  * If Qxd8, then h8g7+ wins the queen (discovered check)\n  * If Kxd8, then h8g7+ Ke8, f1a6+ wins material\n  * Black has no good way to decline the sacrifice\n5. Other options:\n- h4f5 looks tempting but after Qxf5, White loses initiative\n- f1a6 is good but not as forcing as g5d8\nThe queen sacrifice g5d8 is the most forcing and decisive move, leading to either mate or significant material gain.\n```\ng5d8\n```"
