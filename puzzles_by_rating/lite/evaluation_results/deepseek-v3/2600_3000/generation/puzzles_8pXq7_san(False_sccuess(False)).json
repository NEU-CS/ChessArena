When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (Black has knight vs White's knight)\n2. Black's king is more active (b6 vs White's king on d2)\n3. White has a passed pawn on g4, but it's currently blocked by f3\n4. Black has a passed pawn on a4\n5. White's knight on a5 is very active\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. **d6e4** - Knight moves to e4, attacking g3 pawn and potentially supporting f3 pawn\n2. **b6c7** - King moves towards center\n3. **a4a3** - Pushing the passed pawn\n4. **f3f2** - Pushing the f-pawn to create threats\nLet's evaluate each:\n1. **d6e4**:\n   - Attacks g3 pawn\n   - If White defends with Kd2-e2, we can play f3f2 next\n   - But White could play Nc6 attacking our knight\n2. **b6c7**:\n   - King moves towards center but doesn't create immediate threats\n   - White can push g4-g5 with tempo\n3. **a4a3**:\n   - Pushes the passed pawn\n   - White can block with Kc2 or Kc3\n   - But this creates long-term pressure\n4. **f3f2**:\n   - Creates immediate threat to promote\n   - White must respond with Kd2-e2 or Kd2-e1\n   - Then we can play a4a3 with strong passed pawns\n**Best move is f3f2** because:\n- It creates the most immediate threat\n- Forces White's king to move away from the center\n- After Ke2, we can push a4a3 with both pawns becoming dangerous\n- White's knight is too far away to help stop both passed pawns\nThe move f3f2 leads to the most forcing and dangerous continuation for White to handle.\n```\nf3f2\n```"
