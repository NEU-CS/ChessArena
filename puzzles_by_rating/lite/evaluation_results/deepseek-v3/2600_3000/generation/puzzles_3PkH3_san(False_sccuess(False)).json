When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has Q+R vs Black's Q+B. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d5 is very powerful, eyeing multiple squares.\n- Black's king is exposed on g7 with only pawn cover.\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that could become dangerous.\n- White's rook on e3 is active but somewhat blocked by its own pawn on f2.\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: d5f7 looks tempting as it threatens mate (Qf7# if the pawn moves). But after ...g6, it's not immediately winning.\n- Rook moves: e3e7 looks strong, pinning the f6 queen to the king.\n- Pawn moves: f2f4 could be useful to open lines for the rook.\n4. Calculating e3e7:\n- After e3e7, Black's queen is pinned. If they move the queen, we can capture the bishop with Qxb4.\n- If Black tries ...Qxe7, then Qxe7 Kxe7 leaves White with a winning pawn endgame due to passed pawns.\n- Black's best seems to be ...Qf5, but then Qxf5 gxf5 and Re7+ wins the bishop.\n5. Calculating d5f7:\n- d5f7 g6 Qxg6+ hxg6 Re7# is a nice mate, but Black can play ...Qxf7 instead.\n- After d5f7 Qxf7 Rxf7+ Kxf7, we reach a pawn endgame that might be drawn.\n6. Other queen moves don't seem as forcing or decisive.\nConclusion: e3e7 creates the most problems for Black by pinning the queen and threatening multiple discoveries. It maintains all of White's advantages while creating immediate tactical threats.\n```\ne3e7\n```"
