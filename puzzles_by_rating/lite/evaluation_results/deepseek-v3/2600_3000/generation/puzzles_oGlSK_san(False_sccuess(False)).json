When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

But allows ...Ke7-e6 counterplay.\n   - **d4e4**: Also threatens f4, but less central than e5.\n   - **d4c4**: Retreats the king, not ideal.\n   - **d4c3**: Too passive.\n   - **d5d6**: Advances passed pawn, but blocks it with king.\n   - **c5c6**: Creates connected passed pawns, but may be premature.\n   - **h2h3/h4/g2g3/g4**: These pawn moves don't address the main battle.\n5. **Best Plan**:\n   - The key is to advance the connected passed pawns while restraining Black's pawns.\n   - First, we should eliminate Black's f4 pawn to remove counterplay.\n   - Then we can advance our pawns with king support.\n6. **Best Move**:\n   - **d4e5** is strongest:\n     - Attacks f4 pawn immediately\n     - If ...Ke7-e6, we can play d5-d6, maintaining pressure\n     - If ...f4-f3, we can take with g2xf3\n     - Keeps our king active and central\nOther moves either don't address the key issues or are too passive. The immediate pawn advances (d5d6/c5c6) are premature without first dealing with Black's counterplay on the kingside.\n```\nd4e5\n```"
