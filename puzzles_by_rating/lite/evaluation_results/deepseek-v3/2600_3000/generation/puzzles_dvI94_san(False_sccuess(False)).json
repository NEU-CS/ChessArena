When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n- Black has: Rook (c8), King (f7), Queen (e6), pawns (a7, g6, h5, f5, e4)\n- White has: Rook (d1), Queen (b5), Bishop (h6), pawns (a2, g2, f2, g3), King (g1)\n- Material is roughly equal (Black has Q+R vs White's Q+R+B, but Black has more pawns)\n2. Key observations:\n- White's bishop on h6 is very active, pinning the g7 pawn to the king\n- Black's queen is centralized but somewhat exposed\n- White's queen on b5 is attacking f5 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could become dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qb5xf5, winning a pawn\n- After Qxf5, Black can't take back with g6xf5 because of Bxg7+ winning the rook\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) e6d7 - Queen retreat to defend f5\nb) f5f4 - Advance pawn to defend against Qxf5\nc) c8c1 - Rook invasion to first rank\nd) e6f6 - Queen blocks the bishop's diagonal\n5. Evaluation:\n- e6d7 looks passive and allows White to consolidate\n- f5f4 weakens e4 pawn and gives White more space\n- c8c1 is tempting but after Rxc1, Black's structure remains weak\n- e6f6 is interesting as it blocks the bishop's diagonal and maintains pressure\n6. Best move:\ne6f6 is the most principled:\n- Blocks the bishop's attack on g7\n- Maintains central control\n- Keins pressure on White's position\n- After Qxf5, Black can play Qxf5 and the bishop is no longer pinning g7\nThe move also prepares potential ...Rc1 ideas in the future while keeping all Black's pieces active.\n```\ne6f6\n```"
