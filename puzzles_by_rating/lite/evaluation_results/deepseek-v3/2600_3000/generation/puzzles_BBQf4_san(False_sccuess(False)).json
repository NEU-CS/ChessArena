When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal (Black has queen vs White's queen + knight, but Black has rook vs White's rook)\n2. White has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous\n3. Black's queen is very active on b2, attacking g2 and with potential to swing to the kingside\n4. White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n5. Black's knight on d1 is awkwardly placed and needs to find a better square\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b2g7 - Queen sacrifice to expose White's king\n2. d1e3 - Developing the knight to a better square\n3. b2h8 - Queen move to pin the rook\n4. d8d7 - Rook retreat to defend the 7th rank\nLet's analyze b2g7:\n- b2g7 Rg7 (forced)\n- Then d8g8+ with discovered attack on the queen\n- White would have to play Qg3, but then Rg7 wins the rook\n- However, after Rg7, White has Qg3+ and Black's king is exposed\n- The position becomes very sharp but may favor White's activity\nd1e3 looks interesting:\n- Develops the knight to a better square\n- Threatens to capture on f5 or g2\n- But White can defend with Qe2 or other moves\nb2h8:\n- Pins the rook to the king\n- But White can simply play Rf6, defending the rook\n- Doesn't create immediate threats\nd8d7:\n- Solid move, defends the 7th rank\n- But doesn't create counterplay\nAfter careful consideration, the most forcing and promising move is b2g7, sacrificing the queen to expose White's king and create counterplay. The sequence leads to complications where Black can regain material with interest.\nHere's the move:\n```\nb2g7\n```"
