When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n- White has queen, bishop, knight, pawn vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, pawn\n- White is up a minor piece (bishop vs nothing) but Black has an active rook\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed on f3\n- Black's queen is very active on d1\n- White has threats with the bishop on h6 (controlling g7)\n- Black's rook on a8 is passive\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n- f3e4: Moves king towards center but exposes it more to checks\n- f3e3: Keeps king more protected but still vulnerable\n- f3g2: Gets king to safer square behind pawns\n- f3f2: Similar to g2 but less protected\n4. Threats to consider:\n- Black has Qd1+ possibilities\n- After any king move, Black can play Qd1+ with discovered checks\n- Need to minimize checks while improving king safety\n5. Best choice:\n- f3g2 is strongest as it:\n  * Gets king behind pawn shield\n  * Maintains control of h3 square\n  * Limits Black's checking options\n  * Prepares to possibly bring king to h1 if needed\n  * Keeps options open for our queen to defend\nOther moves either leave the king too exposed or don't improve the position as much. While Black still has some counterplay with the queen, g2 is the most resilient choice.\n```\nf3g2\n```"
