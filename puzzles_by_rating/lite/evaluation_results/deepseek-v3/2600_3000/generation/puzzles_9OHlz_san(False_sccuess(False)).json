When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (just pawns left). White has pawns on a4, c4, d4, g3, h3, g2. Black has pawns on a5, b6, c5, f5, g7, h5.\n2. King positions: White king on e3, Black king on e6. Both kings are actively placed.\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - White has a passed pawn on d4, but it's blockaded by Black's c5 pawn.\n   - Black has potential passed pawns on both wings (a5 and h5).\n   - White's pawn majority is on the kingside (4 vs 3), while Black has a queenside majority.\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - d4d5: This would challenge Black's central control and try to create a passed pawn.\n   - h3h4: This would stop Black's h-pawn from advancing.\n   - g3g4: This could open lines for the king but might weaken the pawn structure.\n   - King moves: The king is well placed on e3, so moving it might not be optimal.\n5. Key considerations:\n   - The d4 pawn is important - pushing it with d4d5 creates immediate pressure.\n   - After d4d5 cxd5, c4xd5 would give White a passed d-pawn.\n   - Black would likely respond with ...Kxd5, but then White's king can become active.\n   - The alternative h3h4 is also good, preventing ...h5-h4 which could create a passed pawn.\n6. Best move: d4d5 is the most principled move, creating a passed pawn and activating our position. Even if it gets exchanged, it improves our king's activity and creates winning chances.\nHere's the move:\n```\nd4d5\n```"
