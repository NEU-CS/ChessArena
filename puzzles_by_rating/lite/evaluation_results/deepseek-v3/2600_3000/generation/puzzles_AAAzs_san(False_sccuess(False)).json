When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has queen, 2 rooks, bishop, knight, 5 pawns\n- White has queen, rook, 2 knights, bishop, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on b2, attacking f2 and the knight on c3\n- White has a strong passed pawn on d5\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- White has pressure along the f-file with rook on f1 and bishop on f5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) b2b6 - Queen moves to b6, attacking the knight on c3 again while also eyeing the f2 square\nb) b2c3 - Immediate capture of the knight, but after Qxc3, White has Qxc3 dxc3 and the passed pawn becomes stronger\nc) e8e7 - Rook moves to e7, defending the bishop on g7 and potentially doubling rooks\nd) g7h6 - Bishop moves to h6, attacking the knight on f2\n4. Evaluation of options:\n- b2c3 seems too committal and helps White's pawn structure\n- e8e7 is solid but doesn't create threats\n- g7h6 is interesting but White can simply move the knight\n- b2b6 maintains pressure while keeping options open\n5. Best move:\nb2b6 is the most flexible and maintains all of Black's advantages. It keeps pressure on c3 and f2, while the queen remains very active. White will have to deal with multiple threats.\nHere's the move:\n```\nb2b6\n```"
