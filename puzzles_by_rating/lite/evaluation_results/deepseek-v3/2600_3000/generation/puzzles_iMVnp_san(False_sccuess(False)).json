When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has 2 rooks, 2 knights vs White's rook, bishop, knight). The position is roughly balanced.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8 with White's bishop on g5 eyeing the kingside. White's king is safer on e1 behind its pawns.\n3. Piece activity: \n   - Black's rooks are not optimally placed (doubled on c8 and h8)\n   - White's bishop is very active on g5\n   - Both knights are well-placed in the center\n4. Pawn structure: \n   - Black has a weak pawn on a6\n   - White has a passed pawn on d4 which could become dangerous\nKey observations:\n- We should improve our rook placement\n- We should consider king safety\n- We need to challenge White's strong bishop\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h8g8 - Connects rooks and gets off the potentially dangerous h-file\n2. c8e8 - Centralizes a rook and covers the e-file\n3. d6e4 - Knight jump to attack White's pawn structure\n4. f8g7 - Improves king safety\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h8g8 is solid, connecting rooks and getting off the h-file\n- c8e8 is more active, putting pressure on the e-file and supporting potential central play\n- d6e4 looks tempting but after Nxe4 Bxe7 Kxe7, White's bishop pair could become strong\n- f8g7 is too passive\nBest move is c8e8, which:\n1. Centralizes the rook\n2. Puts pressure on the e-file\n3. Prepares potential doubling of rooks\n4. Keeps options open for both kingside and queenside play\n5. Doesn't create any weaknesses\n```\nc8e8\n```"
