When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has some positional advantages.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has connected passed pawns on c4 and d5\n- Black's king is exposed on g5\n- Black has threats with the rook on h4 and pawn on f3\n- White's rook on d7 is very active\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) d7d8 - promoting the pawn is tempting but the rook is already very strong\nb) e3g4 - attacking the rook on h4 and threatening to fork king and rook\nc) h1h2 - defending against the h-pawn queening threat\nd) a6a7 - advancing the passed pawn\n4. Analysis of e3g4:\n- After e3g4, if Black takes with hxg4, then Kxg4 and White's king becomes active\n- If Black moves the rook, say Rh6, then Nxf3+ wins a pawn\n- This seems to gain material while activating the king\n5. Analysis of d7d8:\n- Promoting to a queen would be strong, but Black has Rxd8\n- Then Kxf3 and White is better, but not clearly winning\n- The rook is more valuable in its current active position\n6. Analysis of h1h2:\n- Necessary to stop the h-pawn, but doesn't create threats\n- Black can continue with Rg2+ or other active moves\n7. Analysis of a6a7:\n- Good long-term plan, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- Black can create counterplay with Rg2+ or other checks\nAfter careful consideration, e3g4 seems best as it:\n- Attacks the rook\n- Opens the king's path\n- Creates tactical threats\n- Maintains White's active pieces\nThe move is:\n```\ne3g4\n```"
