When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns vs Black's queen, rook, 2 bishops, knight, pawns).\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on e4 is very active\n- Black has a rook on c8 eyeing the c-file\n- Black's bishop pair could become strong if the position opens up\n- White has a slight space advantage\n- White's king is still in the center while Black's is castled\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f5: Attacks the bishop on d7 and pawn on e6\n- e4c6: Fork attacking knight and rook\n- f3g5: Developing the knight with tempo on e6 pawn\n- c1h6: Bishop sacrifice idea to weaken Black's kingside\n- e1g1: Castling to safety\n4. Deep analysis of top candidates:\n- e4c6: After Qxc6 Bxc6, White wins a rook for bishop, but loses the powerful queen. Not ideal.\n- e4f5: After Qf5, Black can play Bf6 or g6. White maintains pressure but no immediate win.\n- f3g5: After Ng5, Black has h6 or Qd5. Interesting complications but not decisive.\n- c1h6: After Bxh6 gxh6, White has Qg4+ Kh8 Qh5 with strong attack. This seems promising.\n- e1g1: Castling is safe but doesn't create immediate threats.\n5. Best move: c1h6 is the most forcing and creates immediate threats against Black's king. The sacrifice leads to a strong attack with Qg4+ and Qh5 ideas, and Black's king will be exposed. Even if Black declines with g6, White can castle with ongoing pressure.\nThe move is:\n```\nc1h6\n```"
