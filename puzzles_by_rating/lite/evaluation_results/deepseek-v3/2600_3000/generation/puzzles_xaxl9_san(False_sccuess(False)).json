When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully. Here's the FEN: `k7/P3Kp2/1PrP3p/6p1/8/6PP/8/8 b - - 1 53`\nFirst, let's visualize the position:\n- Black king at a8\n- White king at e7\n- Black has pawns at f7, h6, g5\n- White has pawns at a7, d6, g3, h3\n- Black rook at c6\n- White has no other pieces\nKey observations:\n1. Material is roughly equal (Black has R vs White's 4 pawns)\n2. White's pawns are advanced, especially the a-pawn which is on the 7th rank\n3. Black's rook is active but needs to stop White's pawns\n4. White's king is very active in the center\nThe immediate threats:\n- White's a-pawn is about to queen (a7-a8=Q)\n- White's d-pawn is passed but blockaded by the rook\n- White's kingside pawns are less dangerous\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. a8b7 - King moves towards the action\n2. c6c8 - Rook checks the white king\n3. c6c7 - Rook attacks the white king\n4. f7f6/f5 - Pawn moves\n5. h6h5/g5g4 - Pawn moves\nLet's evaluate:\n- a8b7: Gets the king closer to help stop the a-pawn, but might be too slow\n- c6c8: Gives a check, but after Ke7-f7, the rook has to retreat\n- c6c7: Attacks the white king, forcing it to move (Ke7-d8/f8)\n- f7f6/f5: Doesn't address the immediate threat of a7-a8\n- h6h5/g5g4: Also doesn't stop the a-pawn\nThe most critical is stopping the a-pawn from queening. The rook can't reach a7 in one move, but we can use it to check the white king away from protecting the a-pawn.\nAfter c6c7 (Rc7+):\n- If Ke7d8, then Rc7xa7 wins the pawn\n- If Ke7f8, then Rc7xa7 also wins the pawn\n- If Ke7e6, then Rc7xa7 still wins the pawn\nThis seems to solve the immediate threat while maintaining the rook's activity. Other moves either don't stop the a-pawn or allow White to queen with check.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc6c7\n```"
