When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: 1 queen, 1 knight, 3 pawns, 1 rook, 1 king\n- Black has: 2 rooks, 1 queen, 5 pawns, 1 king\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a strong knight on d7 and queen on d6.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's knight on d7 is very strong, controlling many squares\n- Black's queen on a5 is under attack from White's pawn on b3\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that could be dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to capture the queen with b3xa4\n- White could potentially play Qd6xa5 if we don't defend properly\n- The knight on d7 is eyeing f8 square\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a5a7: Moves queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- a5d8: Pins the knight to the king\n- e8e7: Challenges the strong knight\n- a8d8: Doubles rooks and pins the knight\n5. Analysis of best options:\n- a5a7 looks safest, keeping the queen active and defended\n- a5d8 is tempting but after 1...a5d8 2. Qd6xa5 Rxa5 3. Nxf8, White wins material\n- e8e7 allows Nxe7+ winning the exchange\n- a8d8 runs into Qd6xa5 Rxa5 Nxf8 winning material\n6. Other considerations:\n- Need to prevent White from playing b3xa4 winning the queen\n- Need to keep the queen active and safe\n- Need to deal with the strong knight on d7\nAfter careful consideration, a5a7 is the best move:\n- Safely moves the queen out of attack\n- Maintains queen's activity\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactical blows\n- Prepares potential future threats along the 7th rank\nThe move also prevents White from gaining any material advantage while keeping Black's position solid.\n```\na5a7\n```"
