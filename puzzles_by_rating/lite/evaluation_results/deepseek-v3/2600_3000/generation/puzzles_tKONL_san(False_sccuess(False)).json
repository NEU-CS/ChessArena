When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has queen, 2 rooks, 3 pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n2. King safety: White's king is somewhat exposed on h1. Black's king is on g8 with some pawn cover.\n3. Key features:\n   - White has a passed pawn on e4\n   - Black has pressure along the f-file with rook on f6\n   - Black's queen is very active on e5\n   - White's queen is well placed on f2, eyeing both sides of the board\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - f2a7: Queen swing to attack the pawn on a6\n   - f2c5: Queen move attacking e5 and c6\n   - e1e3: Rook lift to potentially triple on the e-file\n   - c1d1: Rook move to connect rooks\n   - f3f4: Pawn push to challenge Black's queen\n5. Best options:\n   - f2c5 looks very strong as it attacks Black's queen while also threatening c6 pawn\n   - After Qxc5, dxc5 would leave White with a strong passed pawn duo on e4 and c5\n   - Black would likely avoid this and move their queen, allowing White to maintain pressure\n6. Alternatives:\n   - f2a7 is tempting but Black can defend with Ra8\n   - e1e3 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n   - f3f4 would block the queen's diagonal and isn't necessary yet\nThe most forcing and advantageous move is f2c5, as it directly challenges Black's active queen while creating threats against the c6 pawn. This maintains White's initiative and could lead to favorable exchanges or pawn gains.\n```\nf2c5\n```"
