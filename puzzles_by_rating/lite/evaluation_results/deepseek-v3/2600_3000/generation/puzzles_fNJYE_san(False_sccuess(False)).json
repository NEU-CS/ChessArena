When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and position:\n- White has a rook on c6, pawn on h5, and king on d2\n- Black has a rook on a2, pawn on c2, king on f7, and pawn on g7\n- White is to move (as indicated by \"w\" in FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's pawn on c2 is one square away from queening\n- White's rook is currently blocking the c-pawn's promotion path\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but can defend against immediate threats\n- Black's king is somewhat active near the center\n3. Immediate threats:\n- If White does nothing, Black can play ...c1=Q next move\n- White must prevent this while maintaining activity\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6c2 (capturing the pawn) - but this allows Ra1 pinning the king\n- c6c7 (attacking the black king) - this looks promising\n- d2e3 (king moves closer) - but doesn't solve the c-pawn threat\n- h5h6 (pawn push) - not immediately relevant\n5. Analyzing c6c7:\n- Attacks the black king, forcing it to move\n- After K moves (likely to g8), White can then capture c2 with Rxc2\n- Even if Black tries Ra1, White can respond with Kd3\n- This maintains material equality while keeping activity\n6. Other moves:\n- c6c8 would allow ...c1=Q immediately\n- Moving the rook along the 6th rank doesn't help\n- King moves don't address the immediate threat\n7. Best continuation:\n- c6c7 forces the black king to move\n- Then Rxc2 captures the dangerous pawn\n- White maintains drawing chances or better\nThe most forcing and best move is to attack the black king immediately with the rook:\n```\nc6c7\n```"
