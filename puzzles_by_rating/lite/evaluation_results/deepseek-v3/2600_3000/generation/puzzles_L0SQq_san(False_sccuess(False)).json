When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

First, let's understand the material and position:\n   - White has king on f6, bishop on g6, and pawn on g7\n   - Black has king on d6, bishop on g8, and pawn on h3\n   - White is to move (we're playing as White)\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's g7 pawn is very advanced and threatening to promote\n   - Black's h-pawn is also close to promotion\n   - Both sides have bishops, but White's is more active\n   - The kings are both active in the center\n3. Immediate threats:\n   - Black's h-pawn is 2 moves from promotion (h3-h2-h1=Q)\n   - White's g-pawn is 1 move from promotion (g7-g8=Q)\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - g6e8: This would pin Black's bishop to the king\n   - g7g8=Q: But this isn't listed as a legal move (pawn is blocked?)\n   - f6g5: King moves toward Black's h-pawn\n   - Other bishop moves\n5. Looking at g6e8:\n   - Pins Black's bishop to the king\n   - After 1. g6e8, if Black tries 1...h2, then 2. g7g8=Q wins\n   - If Black moves king instead, we can promote with check\n   - This seems very strong as it prevents Black from making progress with their h-pawn while maintaining our promotion threat\n6. Other options:\n   - Bishop moves like g6h7 don't accomplish much\n   - King moves toward h-pawn are too slow (f6g5)\n   - Other bishop moves don't create immediate threats\n7. Conclusion:\n   - g6e8 is the strongest move as it:\n     * Pins the bishop\n     * Maintains our promotion threat\n     * Stops Black's counterplay with the h-pawn\n     * Creates potential discovered checks\nThe best move is:\n```\ng6e8\n```"
