When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (Black has 2 rooks vs White's rook + bishop, but White has an extra pawn)\n2. Black's king is at d6, White's at e3\n3. White has a passed pawn at c6\n4. Black has doubled rooks on the d-file and a rook on c7\n5. White has a rook on d3 and c1\nThe critical features:\n- White's c6 pawn is dangerous and needs to be stopped\n- Black's rooks are active but not optimally placed\n- Black's pawn structure is slightly compromised with doubled f-pawns\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c7c6 - Blocking the passed pawn with the rook\n2. d6e7 - King moves towards the center\n3. d5d4 - Pushing the d-pawn to create counterplay\n4. c7c8 - Rook retreat (doesn't seem useful)\n5. c7f7 - Rook to f-file (not immediately helpful)\nLet's evaluate c7c6:\n- Immediately stops the c-pawn's advance\n- But leaves the rook vulnerable to White's rook on d3 (Rd3xd5 is possible)\n- After c7c6, if Rd3xd5, then Rc6xd6 and Black is down material\nd6e7 looks safer:\n- Gets the king away from potential checks\n- Prepares to support the d5 pawn\n- If White plays c6c7, we can respond with Rc7xc7\n- Maintains all our piece activity\nd5d4 is interesting:\n- Creates immediate counterplay\n- But after exd4, White's king becomes more active\n- And our d6 king is still exposed\nAfter careful consideration, d6e7 seems most prudent:\n1. It safeguards the king\n2. Maintains control over the position\n3. Doesn't create any weaknesses\n4. Prepares to support our central pawns\nThe other moves either create vulnerabilities (c7c6) or don't improve our position (c7c8). While d5d4 is tempting, it leads to unnecessary complications when we're not clearly better.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd6e7\n```"
