When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

First, let's understand the position:\n- White has a knight on g5 and e4, queen on b3, rooks on a1 and h1\n- Black has a queen on g4 attacking our king, bishop on g7, knight on e5\n- Our king is exposed on e2 with black's queen threatening checkmate threats\n- Black has castling rights (kq) which could be dangerous if we don't act\n2. Looking at the legal moves:\n- e2d3: moves king towards safety but still exposed to queen checks\n- e2f2: moves king towards f-file but still vulnerable\n- e2d2: moves king towards corner but still in queen's sight\n- e2f1: moves king to f1, safer but blocks rook\n- e2e1: moves king back to e1, still exposed\n- g5f3: knight moves to f3, blocking queen's attack on king\n3. The most critical issue is the immediate threat from black's queen on g4. We need to address this first.\n4. g5f3 is the most forcing move:\n- Blocks the queen's attack on our king\n- Attacks black's queen, forcing it to move or be captured\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't expose our king further\n5. Other king moves don't solve the immediate threat and leave us vulnerable to further attacks.\n6. After g5f3, black will likely move their queen (Qg4-h5 or Qg4-h3), but we've relieved the immediate pressure and can then think about consolidating our position.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5f3\n```"
