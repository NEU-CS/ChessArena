When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns\n- Black: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but black has a passed pawn on c4 that could be dangerous.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on e6\n- White's bishop is strong on d4, controlling important diagonals\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on c4\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on c1\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) d4g7 - Bishop sacrifice to expose black's king\nb) f2f8 - Queen move to pin the rook\nc) c3b4 - Capturing the dangerous passed pawn\nd) d2e2 - Protecting the queen and connecting rooks\n4. Evaluating the options:\n- d4g7: After Kxg7, Qf6+ Kg8, Qxe6 Rxe6, we reach an endgame where black's passed pawns might be dangerous\n- f2f8: Qf8 pins the rook to the king, but black can play Qe1+ forcing Kb2, then Qe5+ with counterplay\n- c3b4: This eliminates the dangerous passed pawn but leaves white's structure weak\n- d2e2: Solid move, but doesn't address the immediate threats\n5. Best move seems to be d4g7:\n- It's a forcing sequence that leads to material equality\n- After the exchanges, white has some compensation with the active rook\n- It prevents black from consolidating their position\n- The alternative f2f8 leads to complications that might favor black\nThe bishop sacrifice is the most principled and forcing move in this position. It leads to a roughly equal endgame where white has some activity to compensate for the bishop pair.\n```\nd4g7\n```"
