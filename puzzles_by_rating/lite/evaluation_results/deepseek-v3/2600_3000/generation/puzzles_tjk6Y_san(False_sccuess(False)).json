When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White: Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop, 4 pawns\n- Black: Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is equal, but White has a more active position.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on c6 is very active\n- Black's queen on f5 is attacking g3 pawn\n- Black has a knight on e4 that's well placed\n- White's king is somewhat exposed after castling\n3. Threats:\n- Black is threatening to take the g3 pawn with Qxg3\n- If Qxg3, then hxg3 Rxh2 is dangerous for White\n- White needs to address this threat while maintaining activity\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Qd7: Defends g3 pawn indirectly (if Qxg3 Qxf5)\n- Qf6: Exchanges queens but leaves g3 pawn hanging\n- Qh6: Attacks h7 pawn but doesn't address immediate threat\n- Rook moves: Not ideal as they don't address the threat\n- b1c3: Developing move but doesn't solve immediate problem\n- g3g4: Pushes pawn but allows Qxg4\n5. Best move analysis:\nQd7 is the most precise:\n- If Black takes g3: 1...Qxg3 2.Qxf5 Rxf5 3.hxg3 and White is better\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n- Other moves either allow the capture on g3 or don't improve position\n6. Alternatives:\n- Qf6 leads to queen exchange but weakens g3\n- Qh6 is too slow and doesn't defend g3\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threat\nThe best move is:\n```\nc6d7\n```"
