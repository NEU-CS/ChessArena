When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, pawns on b7, c6, e6, g7, h6, rook on a5\n- White has: king, pawns on b6, f5, g4, g3, rook on b4\n- Material is roughly equal (Black has 5 pawns + rook vs White's 4 pawns + rook)\n2. King safety:\n- Black king is on e7, somewhat exposed but not immediately threatened\n- White king is on e4, more centralized but also exposed\n3. Pawn structure:\n- Black has a passed pawn on c6, but it's blockaded by White's b6 pawn\n- White has a passed pawn on f5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's pawns on g7 and h6 are potential targets\n4. Rook activity:\n- Black's rook on a5 is active but could be more useful\n- White's rook on b4 is very active, controlling the 4th rank\nKey observations:\n- White's f5 pawn is a serious threat that could advance\n- Black needs to activate the rook and/or create counterplay\n- The position is roughly balanced but requires precise play\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. a5a8 - Rook to the 8th rank, putting pressure on White's back rank\n2. e6f5 - Capturing the dangerous f5 pawn, but opens up the position\n3. a5e5 - Rook to e5, centralizing and attacking the e4 king\n4. g7g5 - Pushing the g-pawn to challenge White's pawns\nBest move analysis:\n- e6f5 seems tempting but after exf5, White gets a strong passed pawn\n- a5e5 looks strong, attacking the king and centralizing the rook\n- g7g5 is too slow and weakens the kingside\n- a5a8 is passive and doesn't create immediate threats\nThe best move is a5e5, centralizing the rook and creating immediate threats against White's king while maintaining flexibility. This puts maximum pressure on White's position.\n```\na5e5\n```"
