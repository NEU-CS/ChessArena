When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: Queen, Rook, 4 pawns\n- Black: Rook, Rook, King, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has Q vs R, but Black has an extra R)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on f1\n- Black king is relatively safer on f6\n3. Key observations:\n- Black has doubled rooks on the 7th rank (e7 and h7)\n- White's queen is very active on a6\n- Black has connected passed pawns on a5 and d5\n- White has a passed pawn on f4\n4. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...Rhe7 with strong pressure\n- White can create threats with the queen against the black king\n5. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a6e6: Queen check, forcing the king to move\n- b1b8: Rook to the 8th rank, creating threats\n- f4f5: Advancing the passed pawn\n- a6b7: Queen move threatening to infiltrate\n6. Analysis of a6e6+:\n- After Ke5, White can play f4f5+ with strong pressure\n- Or after Kf7, White can play Qd7+ with threats\n- This seems very promising\n7. Analysis of b1b8:\n- Black can defend with Rxb8 Qxb8 Rhe7\n- Not as forcing as the queen check\n8. Analysis of f4f5:\n- Good move, but not as forcing as the check\n- Black can respond with ...Ke5 or ...Kf7\n9. Best move:\na6e6+ is the most forcing and creates immediate threats against the black king. After Ke5, f4f5+ will be very strong, and after Kf7, Qd7+ creates mating threats.\nThe move a6e6 forces the black king to move into a more vulnerable position and opens up tactical possibilities.\n```\na6e6\n```"
