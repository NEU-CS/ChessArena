When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n- White has: King, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has: King, Bishop, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but black has more pawns which could be significant in the endgame.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's king is very active (d5)\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed (f7)\n- Both sides have passed pawns (white's g4, black's a4 and c4)\n- Black's bishop is very active (g1) controlling important squares\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: f7g7 looks safest, keeping the king near the center\n- Bishop moves: g1a7 or g1b6 could be interesting to attack white's pawns\n- Pawn moves: a4a3 or g6g5 could advance passed pawns\n4. Evaluating options:\n- f7g7: Safe but doesn't accomplish much\n- g1a7: Attacks the b2 pawn which is defended by the bishop\n- g1b6: Puts pressure on d4 square and white's pawn structure\n- a4a3: Advances the passed pawn but blocks the b3 pawn\n- g6g5: Creates a passed pawn but opens the position for white's king\n5. Best choice:\ng1b6 seems strongest because:\n- It maintains the bishop's activity\n- Puts pressure on white's pawn structure (threatening to win the c3 pawn)\n- Controls important squares near white's king\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses in black's position\nOther moves either don't improve our position or create weaknesses. The bishop is our most active piece and we should keep it active.\n```\ng1b6\n```"
