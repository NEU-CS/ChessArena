When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has king + queen + 5 pawns\n- White has king + queen + 3 pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (queen vs queen, Black has 2 extra pawns)\n2. Positional factors:\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White's queen is very active on e3\n- Black's queen is active but could be more dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black has pawn weaknesses on c4 and f5\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qe3xc4 winning a pawn\n- White also has ideas like Qe3-c5+ or Qe3-b3+\n- Black needs to activate the queen while protecting the king\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g4g8: Queen to g8 protects the king and threatens to swing to h7 or f7\n- g4h3: Queen checks on h3, but after Kd1 it's not clear\n- g4f3: Queen checks on f3, but after Ke1 it's not great\n- c4c3: Pushing the pawn to create counterplay\n5. Best move analysis:\n- g4g8 is very strong because:\n  * Protects the king from checks\n  * Prepares to swing to h7 or f7 to attack\n  * Covers the back rank\n  * Maintains all options for the queen\n- Other moves either expose the king or don't improve the position\n6. Why not other moves:\n- g4h4/g5/g6/g7 don't accomplish much\n- h5h4 weakens the pawn structure\n- c4c3 can be met with Qe3xc3\n- b8c8/a8 just move the king but don't solve the problem\nThe best move is clearly g4g8, activating the queen while securing the king's safety.\n```\ng4g8\n```"
