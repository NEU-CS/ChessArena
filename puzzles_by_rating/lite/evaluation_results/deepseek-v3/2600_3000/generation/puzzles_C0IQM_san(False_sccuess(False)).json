When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is slightly in Black's favor.\n2. **King Safety**:\n   - White king is at c2, Black king is at b4\n   - Both kings are somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n3. **Pawn Structure**:\n   - White has a passed pawn on e4 that could be pushed\n   - Black has connected passed pawns on g5 and h5 that are more advanced\n   - Black's pawns are more dangerous in the long run\n4. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **e4e5**: Creates a passed pawn and opens space for the king\n   - **f4g5**: Captures a pawn but leaves f-pawn weak\n   - **h3h4/g3g4**: Tries to stop Black's pawns but may be too slow\n   - King moves: Not immediately helpful\n5. **Key Considerations**:\n   - Need to activate the king to help stop Black's pawns\n   - Need to create counterplay with White's pawns\n   - Time is crucial as Black's pawns are more advanced\n6. **Best Move**:\n   - **e4e5** is strongest because:\n     * Creates a passed pawn that Black must deal with\n     * Opens the d3 square for the white king to advance\n     * After e5, if Black takes fxe5, then fxe5 creates a protected passed pawn\n     * If Black doesn't take, e6 becomes a threat\nOther moves:\n- f4g5 hxg5 and Black's h-pawn becomes dangerous\n- King moves don't address the pawn race\n- Pushing h or g pawns doesn't create enough counterplay\n```\ne4e5\n```"
