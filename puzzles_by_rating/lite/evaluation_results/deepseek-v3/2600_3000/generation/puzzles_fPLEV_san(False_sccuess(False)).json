When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the material balance:\n- White has: Rook (e7), Queen (f5), Knight (f3), Pawns (d4, g3, f2, a2)\n- Black has: Rook (f8), Bishop (g7), Queen (a3), Bishop (c3), Knight (c2), Pawns (b7, a7, h6, d6, g5)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n2. Key observations:\n- White's Queen on f5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's King is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has pressure along the e-file with the Rook on e7\n- Black's Bishop on c3 is pinned to the King by White's Rook on a1\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg5, winning a pawn\n- White might play Re8+ forcing the King to h7, then Qf7 with mate threats\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7f6 - blocks the Queen's attack on g5 and develops the Bishop\n- c3c8 - unpins the Bishop and defends the back rank\n- f8e8 - trades Rooks and reduces White's pressure\n- a3a6 - moves the Queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n5. Evaluating the best move:\n- g7f6 seems most principled:\n  * Blocks the Queen's attack on g5\n  * Develops the Bishop to a more active square\n  * Maintains control over e5\n  * Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Other options have drawbacks:\n  * c3c8 leaves the Bishop passive\n  * f8e8 allows White to maintain pressure after Rxe8+ Rxe8\n  * a3a6 doesn't address the immediate threats\n6. After g7f6, possible continuation:\n- If Qxg5, then Bxg5 Nxg5 and Black has compensation for the pawn\n- White might play Qf4 or Qh5, but Black can defend\nThe move g7f6 solves multiple problems at once while keeping Black's position solid.\n```\ng7f6\n```"
