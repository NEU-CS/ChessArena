When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's b2 pawn is one square from queening\n2. White's rooks are very active\n3. Black's king is exposed to checks\n4. White's g-pawn is passed but not immediately dangerous\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. d6d1 - Blocking the b2 pawn with a rook\n2. c8c4+ - Checking the black king\n3. d6b6 - Attacking the b2 pawn\n4. g4g5 - Pushing the passed pawn\n**Evaluation:**\n- d6d1 looks most forcing as it stops the b2 pawn immediately\n- After d6d1, if black promotes with b2b1=Q, we have d1d4+ winning the new queen\n- Other moves allow black to push b2b1=Q with serious threats\n**Best Move:**\nThe most precise is d6d1, stopping the pawn and preparing a discovered check.\n```\nd6d1\n```"
