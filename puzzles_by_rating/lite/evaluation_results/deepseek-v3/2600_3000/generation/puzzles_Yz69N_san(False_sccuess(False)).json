When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, bishop, 2 rooks, 4 pawns\n- Black has queen, bishop, knight, rook, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White may be slightly better due to more active pieces)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on c6 is very active\n- Black's queen on b4 is attacking the c4 pawn\n- White has a passed pawn on b5\n- Black has a knight on c3 attacking the e2 pawn\n- White's bishop on f4 is strong, controlling important diagonals\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) c6e8 - Queen checks the king, forcing it to move\nb) d2d8 - Rook lift to the 8th rank, threatening mate\nc) f4h6 - Bishop sacrifice to open the king\nd) b5b6 - Pushing the passed pawn\n4. Analysis of c6e8:\n- After c6e8+ Kg8h7\n- White can follow up with f4h6! g7h6\n- Then d2d8 threatening mate on h8\n- Black would have to give up material to prevent mate\n5. Analysis of d2d8:\n- Immediate rook lift\n- Black can defend with qb4d6\n- Not as forcing as the queen check first\n6. Analysis of f4h6:\n- Interesting sacrifice but may not be necessary yet\n- We can first force the king to h7 with the queen check\n7. Analysis of b5b6:\n- Good move but not as forcing as the queen check\n- We can play this later after forcing the king to h7\nThe most forcing and strongest line appears to be starting with the queen check, forcing the king to h7, then playing the bishop sacrifice to open up the king's position.\nHere's the sequence I'm seeing:\n1. c6e8+ Kg8h7\n2. f4h6! g7h6\n3. d2d8 with mate threats\nTherefore, the best first move is the queen check:\n```\nc6e8\n```"
