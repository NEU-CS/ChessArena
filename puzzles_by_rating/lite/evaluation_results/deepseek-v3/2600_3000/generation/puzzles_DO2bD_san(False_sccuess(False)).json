When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has queen, rook and pawns\n- White has queen, bishop and pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on d5, but it's blockaded by Black's e5 pawn\n- Black's rook on b4 is very active, attacking White's g4 pawn\n- Black's queen is centralized and can quickly switch between attack and defense\n- White's king is exposed on c3\n3. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is to capture the g4 pawn with Rxb4\n- White's main threat is to advance the d-pawn or create counterplay with the queen\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Rxb4 - wins a pawn but allows White counterplay with Qxb4\nb) Qf7 - centralizes queen more, defends b7 pawn\nc) Qe6 - blocks White's pawn, but less active\nd) Kb7 - improves king safety\n5. Best move analysis:\n- Rxb4 seems tempting, but after Qxb4 Qxb4 axb4+ Kxb4, Black is up a pawn but the position simplifies\n- Qf7 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Qe6 is too passive\n- Kb7 improves king safety while maintaining all options\nThe best move is to improve king safety while keeping all pieces active. Moving the king to b7 achieves this while also preparing to potentially bring the rook to b5 later.\n```\na7b7\n```"
