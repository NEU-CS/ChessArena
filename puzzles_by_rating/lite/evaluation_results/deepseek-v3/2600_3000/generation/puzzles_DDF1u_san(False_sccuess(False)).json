When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material balance and key features:\n   - Black has queen (b3), 2 rooks (d8,c8), bishop (b7), pawns (e4,h7,g5,h5)\n   - White has queen (d4), rook (a7), knight (d7), pawns (e3,g3,h2)\n   - Black's king is on g5, White's king on g1\n   - Black has a passed e-pawn that's well advanced\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's queen on d4 is very active and controls key squares\n   - Black's queen on b3 is also active but somewhat limited by White's pawn structure\n   - Black's rooks are not optimally placed (doubled on the d-file)\n   - Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on e4\n   - White's knight on d7 is well placed and could become dangerous\n3. Threats to consider:\n   - White could play Qd4xb6, winning the bishop\n   - White could play Rd1-d6, increasing pressure\n   - Black needs to activate pieces while maintaining the e4 pawn\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - b3d5: Queen trade, but after Qxd5 exd5, White's pieces become more active\n   - c8c1: Rook infiltration, but White can defend with Rd1xc1\n   - b7a6: Bishop move, but doesn't accomplish much\n   - d8d7: Challenging the knight, but White can play Nxf6+\n   - b3g8: Interesting queen maneuver, threatening to enter the kingside\n5. Best move seems to be b3g8:\n   - Gets the queen to a more active position\n   - Threatens mate on g2 (Qg8-g2#)\n   - Forces White to respond, gaining time\n   - Keeps all other pieces protected\n   - Maintains pressure on the position\nOther moves either don't improve the position or allow White counterplay. b3g8 is the most forcing and active move.\n```\nb3g8\n```"
