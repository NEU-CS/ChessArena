When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, and pawns vs White's two rooks, queen, and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on c5 is very active, eyeing the b4 pawn and e3 pawn.\n- Black's rook on e4 is centralized and can swing to attack.\n- White's rooks are doubled on the b-file, but b8 rook is very active.\n- White's queen on e2 is somewhat passive.\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Rb7 or Rxb6, but nothing immediate.\n- Black can consider attacking the weak e3 pawn or creating threats against White's king.\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5e3: Queen takes e3 pawn, but after Qxe3 Rxe3 Rxe3, Black loses the queen for rook and pawn - not favorable.\n- e4h4: Rook swing to h-file, threatening mate on h1. This looks dangerous for White.\n- f8e8: Consolidating the rooks, but not creating immediate threats.\n- g7g5: Pushing the pawn to create space, but not directly threatening.\n5. Best move analysis:\n- e4h4 is very strong because:\n  * It threatens Rh1# which must be addressed immediately.\n  * White's only defenses are Qf2 (blocking with queen) or g3 (pawn block).\n  * After e4h4, if Qf2 then Black can play Qxf2+ Kxf2 Rh2+ winning material.\n  * If g3, then Black can play Qxe3 with a strong attack.\nOther moves don't create such immediate threats or lose the initiative.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne4h4\n```"
