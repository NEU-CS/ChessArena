When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, knight, rook, 3 pawns\n- White has: king, bishop, rook, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is very active (f7)\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed (h8)\n- White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h6\n- Black has connected passed pawns on c3 and d3\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to advance the h-pawn (h6-h7) which would be dangerous\n- White's rook on h1 is eyeing the h-file\n- Black's rook on d2 is active but somewhat blocked by its own pawns\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d2h2: Rook swing to counter White's rook\n- b6d5: Knight centralization\n- a6a5: Pawn advance\n- c3c2: Pushing the passed pawn\n5. Analysis:\n- d2h2 looks strong as it challenges White's rook and defends against h-pawn advancement\n- b6d5 would be good but White can play Bxd5 winning the knight\n- a6a5 doesn't address immediate threats\n- c3c2 is tempting but White can play Kf7-e6 stopping the pawns\n6. Best move:\nd2h2 is the most forcing move that addresses White's threats while keeping our own counterplay with the passed pawns. It prevents White from playing Rh1-h2-h7 and maintains the rook's activity.\n```\nd2h2\n```"
