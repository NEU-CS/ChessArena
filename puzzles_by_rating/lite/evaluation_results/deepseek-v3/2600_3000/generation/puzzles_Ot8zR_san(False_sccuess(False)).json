When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, bishop, knight, rook, pawn vs Black's queen, 2 rooks, bishop, pawn\n- Material is roughly equal (White may be slightly better)\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has strong pieces near Black's king (queen on a7, bishop on b4, rook on e1)\n- Black has threats with queen on b5 and rook on d8\n- White's pawn on g5 is passed and dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e1e7: Rook sacrifice to expose the king\n- a7b6: Queen move attacking b5 queen while keeping pressure\n- b4d6: Bishop move attacking f8 rook\n- g5g6: Pushing the passed pawn\n4. Analyzing e1e7:\n- e1e7 kxe7 (forced)\n- Qa7xe7+ Kf8\n- Now White has Q vs R+B, but Black's king is very exposed\n- Follow up with Bb4-d6+ winning the rook\n- This seems very promising\n5. Other moves:\n- a7b6 allows Qxb6 which isn't clearly better\n- b4d6 allows Black to defend with Rd7\n- g5g6 is slow and gives Black time to organize defense\n6. Conclusion:\nThe rook sacrifice e1e7 leads to a forced sequence where White gets a strong attack against Black's exposed king, with good chances to win material or deliver mate.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne1e7\n```"
