When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's understand the material and position:\n- White has king at b4, bishop at c4, rook at h7, pawns at a3, b2, h4\n- Black has king at e8, rook at e4, bishop at d1, pawn at f5\n- White is to move (as indicated by 'w' in FEN)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's rook is attacking white's bishop on c4\n- White's rook is on the 7th rank, which is very strong\n- Black's bishop is poorly placed on d1 (blocked by its own pawn structure)\n- White has a passed pawn on h4 that could be dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h7h8 - rook promotion (but not necessary yet)\nb) h7e7 - pinning black's king to the rook\nc) b4c5 - moving king to safety while attacking black's rook\nd) h4h5 - advancing the passed pawn\n4. Evaluating the best move:\n- h7e7 looks very strong as it pins the black rook to the king\n- After h7e7, black cannot take the bishop because then Rxe8 is mate\n- Black would have to move the king, allowing white to win the rook\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or miss this opportunity\n5. Why not other moves:\n- b4c5 allows black to play Rxc4, which is bad for white\n- h4h5 doesn't address the immediate threat to the bishop\n- Rook promotions are premature when we have a better tactical shot\n6. After h7e7, sample continuation:\n- h7e7 Ke8f8 (only move to avoid losing the rook)\n- Bc4xe4 f5xe4\n- Now white has rook vs bishop with passed pawns, which should be winning\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh7e7\n```"
