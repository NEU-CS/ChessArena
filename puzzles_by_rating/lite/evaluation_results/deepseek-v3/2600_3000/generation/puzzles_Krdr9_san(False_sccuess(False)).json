When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: 1 bishop, 1 knight, 4 pawns\n- Black has: 1 rook, 1 bishop, 1 knight, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black has slight edge with rook vs bishop+knight)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on h6\n- Black has a strong knight on f5 eyeing g3 and h4\n- White's bishop on d5 is very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8\n- Black's rook on d8 is controlling the d-file\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) d5g8 - Bishop sacrifice to expose black king\nb) e2e8 - Rook lift to threaten back rank\nc) b3d4 - Knight centralization\nd) g3g4 - Pawn push to challenge black's knight\n4. Deep analysis:\n- d5g8 looks very promising: after Bxg8 Kxg8, white can play e2e8+ winning the rook on d8 (Rd8xe8 Rxe8+)\n- If black doesn't take the bishop, white can maintain pressure\n- Other moves don't create immediate threats or lose the initiative\n5. Calculation:\nAfter d5g8:\n- If Kxg8, then e2e8+ Rd8xe8 Rxe8+ Kf7, and white has rook vs bishop with passed h-pawn\n- If black doesn't take, white can follow up with threats against the exposed king\n6. Conclusion:\nThe bishop sacrifice d5g8 is the most forcing and promising move, creating immediate threats against black's king while maintaining material equality in most lines.\n```\nd5g8\n```"
