When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Count**: \n   - Black has queen, rook, bishop, pawns vs White's queen, rook, knight, pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal (Black has slight edge with bishop pair potential)\n2. **Positional Factors**:\n   - White has strong pressure on the kingside with queen on h3\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n   - White has a passed pawn on e5\n   - Black's bishop on c5 is very active\n3. **Threats**:\n   - White could play Qxh7+ if given the chance\n   - Black needs to address the kingside safety while maintaining counterplay\n4. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **b7e4**: Queen moves to e4, attacking the e5 pawn and eyeing h1\n   - **c5e7**: Bishop retreats to e7, defending h4 square against Qxh7 ideas\n   - **f8e8**: Rook moves to e8, putting pressure on the e5 pawn\n   - **g8h8**: King moves to safer h8 square\n5. **Best Move Analysis**:\n   - **b7e4** looks most promising:\n     * Attacks the e5 pawn\n     * Eyes the h1 square which could be useful for mating threats\n     * Maintains pressure on the position\n     * Prevents Qxh7+ ideas by controlling h7\n   - Other moves like c5e7 or g8h8 are more defensive and don't create counterplay\n   - f8e8 is okay but doesn't address the kingside safety as well\n6. **Potential Continuation**:\n   After b7e4, if White defends e5 with say f2f4, Black can consider doubling rooks on the e-file or bringing the other rook into play.\nThe move b7e4 combines defense with active counterplay, making it the best choice in this position.\n```\nb7e4\n```"
