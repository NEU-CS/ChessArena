When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's visualize the board based on the FEN:\n- Black king at c5\n- Black pawns at a6, b6, h5\n- White knight at g6\n- White pawns at b4, c4, h4\n- White king at f4\n- Black bishop at g4\n2. Key observations:\n- Black is down material (bishop vs knight + extra pawns)\n- White has a passed pawn on the h-file\n- Black's king is somewhat active in the center\n- White's king is well placed to support pawns\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\na) c5d6 - King moves forward\n   - Gets closer to white's pawns\n   - But allows white to push h5 (h4-h5) which is dangerous\n   - King might get cut off from defending b6 pawn\nb) c5c6 - King moves sideways\n   - Keeps pressure on b4 pawn\n   - Maintains flexibility\n   - But doesn't make progress\nc) c5d4 - King moves toward center\n   - Centralizes the king\n   - Puts pressure on white's c4 pawn\n   - Might help stop white's pawn advances\nd) c5c4 - King captures pawn\n   - c5c4 would be capturing the c4 pawn\n   - But after Kxc4, white can play h5 with strong passed pawn\n   - Black's b6 pawn becomes weak\n4. Best choice:\n- c5d4 seems most principled:\n  - Centralizes the king\n  - Puts pressure on white's pawns\n  - Maintains flexibility\n  - Doesn't allow immediate h5 push\n  - Keeps options to go after either side of the board\nThe other moves either allow white to create a dangerous passed pawn (h5) or don't make progress. c5d4 keeps the position more balanced.\n```\nc5d4\n```"
