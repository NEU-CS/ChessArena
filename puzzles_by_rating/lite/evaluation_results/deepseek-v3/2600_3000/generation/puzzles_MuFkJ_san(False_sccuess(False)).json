When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (f8), Rook (g2), Knight (h4), pawn (f6), pawn (d4)\n- White has: Rook (d5), Bishop (b3), pawn (a6), pawn (c2), pawn (b2), pawn (d3), pawn (e4), pawn (h2)\n- Black is down material (5 points vs 8 points), but White's king is very exposed.\n2. King safety:\n- White's king is on f1 with very little protection\n- Black's king is on e3, also exposed but has more escape squares\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White's rook on d5 is attacking Black's pawn on d4\n- Black's rook on g2 is attacking White's pawn on h2\n- Black's knight can potentially fork White's king and rook\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g2h2: Capturing the pawn immediately\n- h4f3: Forking the king and rook\n- e3f4: Moving the king to safety while attacking the e4 pawn\n5. Analysis of g2h2:\n- Captures the pawn and threatens the h-file\n- White can respond with Kf1g1, but then Black can play Rh2xh1\n- This leads to a rook exchange but keeps pressure\n6. Analysis of h4f3:\n- Forks king on f1 and rook on d5\n- White would likely move the king (Kg1)\n- Then we can take the rook (Nxd5)\n- But after exd5, we're still down material\n7. Analysis of e3f4:\n- Gets the king to relative safety\n- Attacks the e4 pawn\n- But doesn't create immediate threats\nThe best move appears to be g2h2, as it:\n- Wins material immediately\n- Maintains pressure on White's king\n- Opens the possibility of doubling rooks on the h-file\n- Creates immediate threats that White must respond to\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to consolidate their position. The immediate capture is most forcing and maintains Black's initiative.\n```\ng2h2\n```"
