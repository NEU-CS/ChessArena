When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Knight, Rook, pawns\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces and a passed h-pawn.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a dangerous passed pawn on h6\n- Black's rook on e2 is very active\n- White's queen and rook are well placed for an attack\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qg7+ next move if not prevented\n- The h-pawn is close to promotion\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2h2 (attacking the queen)\n- g6f5 (defending against Qg7+)\n- f8f7 (defending the 7th rank)\n5. Analysis:\n- e2h2 looks tempting but after Qxh2, Rxh2 Rg8+ wins the bishop\n- g6f5 allows Qg7+ anyway after f8f7\n- f8f7 seems most solid, preventing Qg7+ and keeping the rook active\n6. Best move:\nf8f7 is the most solid choice, preventing immediate threats while keeping the rook active. It maintains control of the 7th rank and defends against potential queen checks.\nHere's the move:\n```\nf8f7\n```"
