When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. First, let's assess the material balance:\n- White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns\n- Black has a queen, two rooks, and pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has a very active position with threats\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on g5 is very dangerous, eyeing g7 and h6\n- White's knight on e4 is centralized and strong\n- Black's queen is on a2, not very active\n- Black's rooks are not well coordinated\n- White has threats like Qh6 or Nf6+\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Qg5 threatens Qxg7# if not defended\n- After Qxg7+, Kxg7 allows Nf6+ forking king and rook\n- So we must defend g7\n4. Candidate moves to defend g7:\n- f8f7 - blocks the queen's attack on g7\n- g8h8 - moves the rook away but doesn't defend g7\n- f8f6 - blocks but allows Qxg6\n- f8f5 - blocks but allows Qxg6\n5. Other considerations:\n- d7e8 would block the bishop's attack on g7, but allows Qxg7#\n- a2a6 would move the queen but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- We must prioritize defending against mate\n6. Best defensive move:\nf8f7 is the most solid, directly defending g7 against the queen's attack. Other moves either don't defend or create bigger weaknesses.\n7. After f8f7:\n- White might play Qh6, but then we can play g8h8 to defend\n- Or White could play Nf6+, but we have Rxf6\n- The position remains complicated but we survive the immediate threats\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf8f7\n```"
