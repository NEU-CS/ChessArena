When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: knight, rook, 4 pawns\n- White has: bishop, rook, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but position is critical.\n2. King safety:\n- Black king is exposed on c4\n- White king is safer on h2 but not completely safe\n3. Pawn structure:\n- Black has passed pawn on a4\n- White has passed pawn on e5\n- Both sides have weaknesses in pawn structure\n4. Piece activity:\n- Black's rook on g4 is active\n- White's rook on d1 is somewhat restricted\n- Black's knight has many options\nKey observations:\n- White's e5 pawn is strong and needs to be stopped\n- Black's a4 pawn is a potential passed pawn\n- White's bishop on f8 is very active\nCandidate moves to consider:\na) d5e7 - attacking the bishop and preparing to jump to c6\nb) g4g5 - opening lines against white's king\nc) c4b5 - moving the king towards the a4 pawn\nBest move analysis:\n- d5e7 looks strong as it attacks the bishop and prepares Nc6\n- After d5e7 Bxe7, we lose the bishop but our rook becomes more active\n- g4g5 is tempting but opens our own king more\n- c4b5 is too slow and allows white counterplay\nThe best move is d5e7, as it:\n1. Gains time by attacking the bishop\n2. Prepares Nc6 to support the a4 pawn\n3. Maintains control of key squares\n4. Keeps the initiative\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or create weaknesses.\n```\nd5e7\n```"
