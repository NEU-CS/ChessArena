When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. **Material Balance**: Both sides have equal material (no pieces captured yet). White has a slight space advantage.\n2. **Key Features**:\n   - White has a strong knight on g5 attacking f7 (a critical square near Black's king)\n   - Black's king is still in the center (castled kingside but with some weaknesses)\n   - White's queen is centralized on e2\n   - Black has a bishop on d6 that's somewhat restricted by its own pawn on d5\n3. **Candidate Moves**:\n   - **Knight moves**: g5h7, g5f7, g5e6 look most promising\n   - **Queen moves**: e2e6 is interesting but may be premature\n   - **Pawn moves**: c3c4 could challenge Black's center\n   - **Other pieces**: Not particularly active options\n4. **Deep Analysis**:\n   - g5f7: This is a standard knight sacrifice on f7. After ...Rxf7, Qxe6 forks rook and king. Black can defend with ...Qe7, but White gets strong compensation.\n   - g5h7: Less forcing, Black can simply play ...Kxh7 or defend with ...Rh8.\n   - g5e6: Interesting but Black can take with ...fxe6 and the position remains unclear.\n   - e2e6: Looks tempting but after ...fxe6, Nxe6 Qe7 and Black holds.\n   - c3c4: Solid but not as forcing as the knight sacrifice.\n5. **Best Move**:\nThe knight sacrifice g5f7 is the most promising:\n- After 1. Nxf7 Rxf7 2. Qxe6 Qe7 (forced) 3. Qxf7+ Qxf7 4. Bxf7+ Kxf7\nWhite has rook + 2 pawns vs 2 minor pieces, which is roughly equal but with practical chances due to Black's exposed king.\nHowever, even stronger is that after 1. Nxf7 Rxf7 2. Qxe6, Black can't play 2...Qe7 because of 3. Qxf7+! Qxf7 4. Bxf7+ Kxf7 5. Re7+ winning material.\nTherefore, the knight sacrifice leads to a clear advantage.\n```\ng5f7\n```"
