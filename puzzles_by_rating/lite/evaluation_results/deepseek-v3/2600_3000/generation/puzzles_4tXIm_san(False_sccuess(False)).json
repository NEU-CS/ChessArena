When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal (both sides have pawns only)\n2. Black's king is at h3, White's at f3\n3. White has a passed pawn at d5 and potential passed pawns on the queenside\n4. Black's pawn structure is more flexible with pawns at a6, b7, c7, d6, e5, g6\n5. White's pawns are mostly fixed with a4, b4, c4, d5, g4, g5\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h3h4 - advances the king but doesn't help with pawn play\n2. h3h2 - retreats the king but might be useful to defend\n3. c7c6 - challenges White's d5 pawn\n4. b7b6 - prepares to push a6-a5\n5. a6a5 - immediately challenges White's b4 pawn\n6. e5e4+ - checks the white king and gains space\n7. c7c5 - creates a passed pawn on c-file\n8. b7b5 - challenges White's a4 pawn\nLet's evaluate the most promising options:\na6a5:\n- Creates immediate tension on the queenside\n- After b4xa5, Black can recapture with b7xa5\n- This would leave White with a passed a-pawn but Black gets counterplay\n- However, White's king is closer to the queenside\nc7c6:\n- Directly challenges White's strong d5 pawn\n- After d5xc6 b7xc6, Black gets a passed c-pawn\n- White would have connected passed pawns on a4 and b4\n- King position favors White in this scenario\ne5e4+:\n- Forces White's king to move (only to f4)\n- Then Black can play h3h4 to keep the king active\n- This gains space in the center\n- But White can push g5-g6 creating threats\nb7b5:\n- Creates immediate tension\n- After a4xb5 a6xb5, c4xb5 c7xb5\n- This would leave White with a passed a-pawn\n- Black gets a passed b-pawn but White's is more dangerous\nAfter considering all options, **e5e4+** seems strongest because:\n1. It forces White's king to declare its position\n2. Gains central space\n3. Maintains flexibility in pawn structure\n4. Keeps Black's king active\n5. Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\nThe move sequence would likely be:\n1. ... e5e4+\n2. Kf3f4 (only legal move)\nThen Black can follow up with h3h4 maintaining king activity.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5e4\n```"
