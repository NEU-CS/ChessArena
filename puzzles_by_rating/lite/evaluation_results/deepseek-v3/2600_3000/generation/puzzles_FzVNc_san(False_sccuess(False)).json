When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has bishop (b6), knight (c7), queen (d3), rook (d1,f1), pawns (a3,b2,e4,h3)\n- Black has rooks (c8,f8), queen (h5), bishop (e4), pawns (a6,b5,d6,f7,g7,h7)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on h5 is very active and threatening\n- White's knight on c7 is deep in enemy territory\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n- White has potential threats against the black king\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) c7e8 - knight forks queen and rook\nb) b6d4 - bishop move attacking queen\nc) d3d6 - queen move attacking pawn\nd) a2g8 - bishop sacrifice\n4. Analysis of best options:\n- c7e8 looks very strong: after Qxe8, Bxf7+ wins material (Kxf7 Qxf7+)\n- b6d4 is tempting but after Qh6, Black maintains threats\n- d3d6 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- a2g8 is flashy but after Rxg8, White doesn't have enough compensation\n5. Conclusion:\nc7e8 is the strongest move as it forces immediate material gain through a fork and subsequent discovered attack. After 1.Ne8 Qxe8 2.Bxf7+ Kxf7 3.Qxf7+, White wins a rook and has a continuing attack.\nThe best move is:\n```\nc7e8\n```"
