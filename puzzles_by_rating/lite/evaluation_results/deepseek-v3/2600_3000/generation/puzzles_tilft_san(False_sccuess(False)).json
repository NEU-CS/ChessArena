When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is in check from White's bishop on c6 (the white king is on e4)\n2. Black must respond to this check\n3. Black's king is on d6, and has limited options due to White's control of surrounding squares\n4. White has a dangerous passed pawn on d7 that could promote soon\n5. Black has a rook on b6 and bishop on d8\nLet's evaluate the king moves first (priority when in check):\n- d6e7: moves into the diagonal of White's bishop on c6 (still in check) - illegal\n- d6c7: moves away from check, but allows d7d8Q next move\n- d6e6: still in check from bishop on c6 - illegal\n- d6c5: moves away from check, but into b5 pawn's control - would be captured\nNow bishop moves to block/interpose:\n- d8e7: blocks the check, but White can play d7d8Q+ next move\n- d8c7: blocks the check, but allows Kxc7 losing the bishop\n- d8f6: doesn't block the check - illegal\n- d8g5/h4: same, doesn't block - illegal\nRook moves:\n- b6b8: doesn't address the check - illegal\n- b6b7: blocks the check, but allows d7d8Q next move\n- b6c6: captures the checking bishop (Bxc6), but then Kxc6 is possible\n- b6a6: doesn't address check - illegal\n- b6b5: doesn't address check - illegal\nPawn moves (don't address check):\n- f4f3, c4c3: irrelevant when in check\nAfter evaluating all options, the least bad seems to be:\n1. b6c6 (Bxc6) - at least we eliminate the checking piece\n   Then if Kxc6, we have d8a5+ skewering the king\n   But White can play d7d8Q+ instead of Kxc6\n2. d6c7 - gets out of check but allows promotion\n   After d7d8Q, we have Rd6+ but White can block with Qd6\n3. d8c7 - blocks but loses bishop to Kxc7\nThe best practical chance seems to be b6c6, as it at least eliminates the immediate threat and creates some counterplay potential with the bishop on d8.\n```\nb6c6\n```"
