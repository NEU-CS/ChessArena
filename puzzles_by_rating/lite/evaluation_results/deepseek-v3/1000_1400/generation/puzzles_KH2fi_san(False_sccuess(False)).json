When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Bishop, Knight vs Black's Rook, Knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on d6 is very active\n- Black's rook on e8 is tied to defending the back rank\n- Black's knight on f2 is threatening White's pawn structure\n- White has a passed pawn on h3 that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6d8: Rook trade, but this would simplify into an equal endgame\n- d6h6: Attacking the h6 pawn, but Black can defend with Rh8\n- b3g8: Bishop sacrifice, but after Rxg8 it's unclear\n- g3e4: Centralizing the knight and attacking f2\n- h3h4: Advancing the passed pawn\n4. Best options:\n- g3e4 looks strong, attacking the f2 knight and centralizing. After Nxe4, Bxe6 wins material.\n- b3g8 is tempting but risky. After Rxg8, Nxg8 Kxg8 and White has compensation but not clear advantage.\n5. After g3e4:\n- If Black takes: Nxe4 Bxe6 wins the exchange (rook for bishop)\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Rd8 or other threats\nThe most forcing and advantageous move appears to be g3e4, as it either wins material or improves White's position significantly.\n```\ng3e4\n```"
