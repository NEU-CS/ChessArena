When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal (Black has queen, knight, bishop, rook vs White's queen, rook)\n2. Black's king is exposed in the center (d5)\n3. White has a passed pawn on f2 that could become dangerous\n4. Black's pieces are more active, especially the rook on f5 and queen on b6\n5. White's queen on c8 is somewhat awkwardly placed\nLooking at the legal moves:\n1. c5d6 (bishop moves to d6):\n   - Blocks the d-file against White's rook\n   - But exposes the bishop to potential attacks\n   - Not immediately threatening\n2. c5b5 (bishop moves to b5):\n   - Attacks White's queen\n   - Queen would likely move to b7 or a6\n   - Doesn't create immediate threats\n3. c5b4 (bishop moves to b4):\n   - Doesn't accomplish much\n   - Bishop becomes less active\n4. b6c7 (queen moves to c7):\n   - Attacks White's queen\n   - White would likely trade queens (Qxc7 Nxc7)\n   - Leads to an endgame where Black's pieces are more active\n   - This seems promising\n5. b6c6 (queen moves to c6):\n   - Pins White's queen to the king\n   - But White can simply move their queen away\n   - Not as forcing as c7\n6. d5c7 (king moves to c7):\n   - Gets the king to safety\n   - But gives up central control\n   - Not the most active move\nAfter considering all options, b6c7 seems strongest because:\n- It forces the queen trade\n- After Qxc7 Nxc7, Black's pieces are more coordinated\n- The knight on c7 defends e6 and can jump to d5 or e6\n- Black's rook on f5 becomes very active\n- White's passed pawn is not yet dangerous\nThe resulting position would be favorable for Black with better piece activity and king safety.\n```\nb6c7\n```"
