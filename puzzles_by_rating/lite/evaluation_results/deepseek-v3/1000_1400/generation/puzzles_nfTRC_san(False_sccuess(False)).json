When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop pair, with the dark-squared bishop on c5 eyeing the black king.\n- Black's queen on g5 is somewhat exposed.\n- Black's king is vulnerable with limited pawn cover.\n- White's rook on a1 is not yet active.\n3. Threats:\n- Black has potential threats with the queen on g5, but no immediate danger.\n- White can create immediate threats against the black king.\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f2f7: This looks very strong, threatening mate on g7 while attacking the queen.\n- c5f8: Bishop sacrifice to expose the king, but not immediately winning.\n- b1h7: Interesting rook lift, but not as direct as f2f7.\n5. Analysis of f2f7:\n- If Qxf7, then Bxf8 wins the queen for rook and bishop.\n- If Black doesn't take, Qxg7# is mate.\n- Black's only alternative is to move the queen, but then White can play Qxg5, winning the queen.\n6. Other moves don't create such immediate threats or win material.\nConclusion: f2f7 is the most forcing and winning move, either leading to mate or significant material gain.\n```\nf2f7\n```"
