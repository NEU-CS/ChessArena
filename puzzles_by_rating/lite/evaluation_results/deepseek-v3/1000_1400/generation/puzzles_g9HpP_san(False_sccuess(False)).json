When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (no pieces captured yet)\n2. King safety: White's king is castled but Black's is still in the center\n3. Key threats: Black has Qh3 threatening mate on h2\n4. Development: White is slightly better developed\n5. Pawn structure: White has a strong pawn center\nThe most pressing issue is defending against the mate threat on h2. Let's evaluate candidate moves:\n1. g1f2 - Directly defends h3 but blocks the rook and looks passive\n2. f1f3 - Blocks the queen but leaves the rook vulnerable to Bxf3\n3. e1f3 - Also blocks but the knight is more valuable than the bishop\n4. e2h5 - Counterattack but Qxh5 is fine for Black\n5. e2g4 - Blocks the queen and develops the bishop\nAfter considering these, e2g4 seems best because:\n- It blocks the mate threat\n- Develops the bishop actively\n- Maintains control of the center\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Prepares potential future attacks on the kingside\nOther moves like c3d5 look tempting but don't address the immediate threat. The pawn moves don't help with development or defense.\nHere's the move:\n```\ne2g4\n```"
