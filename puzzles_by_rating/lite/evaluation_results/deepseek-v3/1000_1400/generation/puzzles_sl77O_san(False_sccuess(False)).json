When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong attack with queen on f8 and rook on h1 eyeing the h-file\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. Black's queen on a5 is active but somewhat disconnected from the defense\n5. White has threats like Qxg7# or Rh8+ with potential mating nets\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5f7 - Knight moves to f7 to block the h1-h8 diagonal and defend g7\n2. a5d8 - Queen moves to d8 to defend the back rank and help the king\n3. b2b8 - Rook moves to b8 to defend the back rank\n4. e5g4 - Knight moves to g4 attacking f2 pawn but seems too slow\nLet's evaluate e5f7:\n- Immediately blocks the h1-h8 diagonal\n- Defends g7 against Qxg7#\n- Opens possibility of ...Kg8-h8 if needed\n- Keeps knight active and centralized\nOther options:\n- a5d8 is too passive and allows Rh8+ winning\n- b2b8 is met with Qxb8 winning the rook\n- e5g4 doesn't address the immediate threats\nThe most urgent need is to prevent mate threats, so e5f7 seems best. It maintains material equality while addressing the most dangerous threats.\nAfter e5f7, possible continuations:\n- If Qxg7 then ...Kxg7 and Black is okay\n- If Rh8+ then ...Kxh8 Qxh8+ Kg7 and Black can defend\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5f7\n```"
