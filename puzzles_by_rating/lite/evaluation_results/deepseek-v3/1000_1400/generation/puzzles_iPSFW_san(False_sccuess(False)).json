When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's knight on b4 is very active and threatening.\n- Black's knight on f4 is dangerously placed near White's king.\n- Black's rook on d2 is very active and pinning White's pawn on a2.\n- White's e5 pawn is passed and could be dangerous if advanced.\n3. Threats:\n- Black is threatening ...Nxh2 or ...Rxa2.\n- White needs to address these threats while maintaining initiative.\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b4c6: Forking king and pawn, but allows ...Rxa2.\n- b4d5: Centralizing knight, but doesn't address threats.\n- e1d3: Blocking the rook's path to a2, but allows ...Nxh2.\n- c1c7: Very tempting - attacking the king and threatening mate.\n- e5e6: Pushing passed pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats.\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c1c7 is the most forcing move, creating immediate threats against Black's king.\n- After c1c7, Black must respond to the mate threat (Kb8 or Kxc7).\n- If Kb8, we can play b4c6+ winning the pawn on a6.\n- If Kxc7, we have b4a6+ winning the knight on f4 next move.\nThis seems like the most promising line to gain material advantage while keeping the initiative.\n```\nc1c7\n```"
