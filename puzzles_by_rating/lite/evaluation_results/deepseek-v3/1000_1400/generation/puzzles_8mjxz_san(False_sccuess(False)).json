When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (rook, bishop, knight, pawns), but Black has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a knight on g7 that looks dangerous, but it's not immediately threatening mate.\n- Black's queen and dark-squared bishop are very active, putting pressure on White's king.\n- White's king is exposed on h2 with limited pawn cover.\n- Black has a strong dark-squared bishop on h4 eyeing the vulnerable f2 square.\n3. Threats:\n- White's main threat is Qc2-g6+, but Black can defend with ...Qxg6.\n- Black has several attacking possibilities, especially targeting the weak f2 square.\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h4g3: This threatens mate on f2 and forces White to respond. After hxg3, Qxg3 with strong attack.\n- g5g7: This trades queens but leaves Black with a strong initiative.\n- g5e3: Another way to target f2, but less forcing.\n- e6d5: Centralizing the bishop, but not as direct.\n5. Best move:\nh4g3 is the most forcing and dangerous move. It threatens immediate mate on f2 and White has no good way to defend:\n- If hxg3, Qxg3 with unstoppable threats (Qxh3+ next)\n- If Qxg6, Qxg6 and Black wins material\n- Other moves allow ...Qxh3+ with a winning attack\nThe move h4g3 creates an immediate threat that White cannot satisfactorily meet.\n```\nh4g3\n```"
