Material count:\n- Black has: bishop, rook, queen, rook, pawns\n- White has: queen, pawn, knight, bishop, rook, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a very active queen on g6 threatening mate on g7.\n2. Key threats:\n- White's immediate threat is Qxg7# (queen takes g7 pawn is checkmate)\n- Black's king is very exposed on h7\n3. Available moves:\n- h7h8: King moves to h8, but then Qxh6 is mate (white queen takes h6 pawn with checkmate)\n- h7g8: King moves to g8, but then Qxg7 is still mate (queen takes g7 pawn with checkmate)\n- f7g6: Pawn takes the white queen, but this is forced\n4. Evaluation:\nThe only move that prevents immediate checkmate is f7g6, sacrificing the pawn to eliminate White's dangerous queen. While this loses material, it's absolutely forced to avoid mate.\nAfter f7g6:\n- White can recapture with gxf6, but Black survives\n- Black's king remains vulnerable, but at least the immediate mate threat is gone\n- The position remains difficult, but playable\nAll other moves lead to immediate checkmate, so we must take the queen.\n```\nf7g6\n```"
