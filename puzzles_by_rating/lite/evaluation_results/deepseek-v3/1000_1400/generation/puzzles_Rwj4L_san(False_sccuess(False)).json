When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a significant advantage with a rook, bishop, queen, and knight vs Black's rook and queen. Black's king is also very exposed.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on f7 is very powerful, attacking the black king's position\n- White has a rook on h1 and a pawn on g5 that can be used to attack\n- Black's king is stuck in the corner with minimal protection\n- White's queen on b3 is well placed to join the attack\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Sacrificing the bishop to open up the king\n- b3e6: Queen move attacking the knight and potentially joining the attack\n- h1h7: Rook lift to the 7th rank\n- g5g6: Pushing the pawn to open lines\n4. Forcing moves:\nf7g8 looks very promising as it forces the king to take (Kxg8) and then:\n- After Kxg8, g5g6 threatens mate with Qg8#\n- Black would have to give up material to prevent mate\n5. Alternatives:\n- b3e6 is also strong but not as forcing\n- h1h7 is good but gives Black more defensive resources\nThe most decisive move is f7g8, leading to a forced mate or massive material gain.\n```\nf7g8\n```"
