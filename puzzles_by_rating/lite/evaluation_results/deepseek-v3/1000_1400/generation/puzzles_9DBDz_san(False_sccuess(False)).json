When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, knight vs White's rook, bishop, queen). However, Black's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g4, eyeing the g2 bishop and potential threats to White's king\n- Black has a rook on d8 controlling the d-file\n- White's queen on b2 is somewhat exposed\n- White's king is slightly exposed with limited pawn cover\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Rd1-d3-g3 to attack the queen\n- Black can create immediate threats against White's king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4g3: Attacking the g2 bishop while opening discovered attacks\n- d5f4: Forking queen and rook\n- g4f3: Direct attack on the pinned g2 bishop\n- d8f8: Bringing rook to the f-file where White's king is vulnerable\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- g4g3 looks very strong as it attacks the bishop and threatens mate on g2 (Qg2#)\n- After g4g3, if White defends with Qxg3, then Rxg3 wins material\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Qxg2# or other threats\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be g4g3, creating immediate threats against White's king while maintaining pressure on the position.\nHere's the move:\n```\ng4g3\n```"
