When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, queen and pawns vs Black's queen, bishop, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on c6 that's very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- Black has doubled b-bishops which is awkward\n- White's bishop on e2 is very strong, pointing at Black's kingside\n- Black's pawn structure has weaknesses (isolated d5 pawn, doubled b-pawns)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6d8: Forking queen and king, but Black can simply take with queen\n- c6e7+: Discovered attack on queen, but Black can play Qxe7\n- e2h5: Threatening mate on g6, but Black has Qe5 defending\n- c2g6: Sacrificing the queen to open up Black's king\n- e2b5: Attacking the b7 bishop\nAfter careful consideration, the most promising move is c2g6! This is a queen sacrifice that leads to a forced mate or decisive material gain:\n1. If fxg6, then e2h5+ forces mate:\n   - ...Kg7 2. Nxe7 wins the queen\n   - ...Kh7 2. Bxg6+ Kg7 3. Bxf7+ Kxf7 4. Nxe7 wins\n2. If Black doesn't take, we have threats like Bxh6 or Qxg6+ next move\n3. Other queen moves by Black lose material to discovered attacks\nThis is the most forcing and decisive continuation. Here's the move:\n```\nc2g6\n```"
