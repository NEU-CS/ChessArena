When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has queen, rook, pawns\n- White has queen, bishop, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but position is critical.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active, eyeing the g8 rook\n- Black's king is exposed on the g8-h7 diagonal\n- White's bishop on e5 controls important squares\n- Black has passed pawns on c3 and d5\n3. Candidate moves:\na) g8h8 - moves king away from danger but leaves rook vulnerable\nb) g8h7 - moves king to h7 but exposes it to checks\nc) f8f7 - defends the rook and covers the 7th rank\n4. Analysis:\n- g8h8: After Qe6xg8+, Kh8xg8, White has bishop vs rook, which is drawish but Black's pawns may still be dangerous\n- g8h7: Qe6xh6+! is devastating, winning the rook after Kxh6\n- f8f7: Safest move, defends the rook and maintains material balance. After this, White can't immediately exploit anything.\nThe best move is f8f7 as it maintains material equality and doesn't expose the king to immediate dangers. The other moves either lose material or expose the king too much.\n```\nf8f7\n```"
