Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 6 pawns\nBlack is up material (Queen+Bishop vs Rook+Knight)\n2. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on f2 is attacking White's king and rook\n- Black's bishop on b4 is attacking White's pawn on b3\n- White's queen on h5 is attacking Black's rook on f7\n3. King safety:\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's queen is giving check on f2\n- The only legal move is to move the king to h1 (g1h1)\n4. After g1h1:\n- Black can play Qxf1+ winning the rook\n- Or Black can play Qxh2+ with a discovered attack on the queen\n- In both cases, White's position collapses\n5. Alternative ideas:\n- No other legal moves exist (only g1h1 is possible)\n- The position is lost as White cannot defend against all threats\nSince we must make a move and g1h1 is the only legal option, we have to play it despite the losing position.\n```\ng1h1\n```"
