When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White: Rook (a7), Bishop (e4), Pawns (b2, c3, f2, g3)\n- Black: Rook (h8), Knight (f4), Pawns (e6, g6, g7), Queen (h3)\n- Black is up a knight and pawn vs bishop, but White has some active pieces\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on f1\n- Black has queen and knight attacking near the white king\n- Black's queen on h3 is very dangerous, eyeing f1\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qh3xf1#\n- Black also has Nf4-g2+ ideas\n- White needs to address the mate threat first\n4. Move options:\n- f1g1: Gets out of check but allows Qh3xg3 with a discovered attack on the rook\n- f1e1: Gets out of check but leaves the king very exposed on e1\n- e4g2: Blocks the check by interposing the bishop, but Nf4xg2 would win the bishop\n5. Evaluation:\n- f1g1 seems the most resilient, though still difficult\n- After Qh3xg3, White can try to defend with Qd2-f4\n- Other moves lead to quicker losses\nThe best practical chance is to move the king to g1, though the position remains very difficult for White.\n```\nf1g1\n```"
