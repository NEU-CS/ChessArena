When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has some coordination issues with their rooks and minor pieces\n3. The black king is somewhat exposed\n4. White has pressure on the dark squares (e4 bishop vs black's weak dark squares)\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e4g6 - attacking the pawn and potentially opening lines against the king\n2. c1c8 - trading rooks and removing a defender\n3. f3d4 - challenging black's strong knight\n4. d2d4 - central push with tactical possibilities\nLet me evaluate these:\n1. e4g6:\n- Immediately threatens g6 pawn\n- After fxg6, hxg6 opens h-file for white's rook\n- But black can defend with Qe7 or Rg8\n2. c1c8:\n- Forcing rook exchange\n- After Rxc8, Bxc8 white has pressure but black can defend\n- Not the most ambitious\n3. f3d4:\n- Challenges the strong knight\n- After Nxd4, Bxd4 white gets strong bishop\n- But black can play Nxd4 first, then we recapture with bishop\n4. d2d4:\n- Central push attacking c5 and e5\n- Creates potential for discovered attacks\n- After Nxd4, Nxd4 Nxd4 Bxd4 white has strong center\nAfter considering all options, e4g6 seems most promising as it directly targets black's king position and creates immediate threats. The pawn capture leads to open files against the black king which is hard to defend.\nHere's the move:\n```\ne4g6\n```"
