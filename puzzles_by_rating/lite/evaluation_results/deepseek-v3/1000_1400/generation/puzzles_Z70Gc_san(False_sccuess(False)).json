When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

However, White's king is exposed due to the early queen move to e2.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on e6, but it's blockaded by the f7 pawn\n- Black's queen is very active on g3, attacking multiple squares\n- White's king is still in the center (d1)\n- Black has a strong dark-squared bishop on g6 eyeing the weakened light squares around White's king\n3. Threats:\n- Black's queen is threatening to capture on h2 or h4\n- The g6 bishop could potentially join the attack via e4 or d3\n- White's e6 pawn could become dangerous if not contained\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g3h2: Immediate queen capture, but after Qxh2, White can play Qg4+ with some counterplay\n- g6d3: Bishop move attacking the queen, but White can simply move the queen\n- g3e5: Centralizing the queen, but not immediately threatening\n- g6e4: Strong move, threatening to win the queen after ...Bd3+ next move\n- g3h4: Keeping pressure on the h-file while maintaining queen's activity\nAfter careful consideration, g6e4 seems strongest:\n- It threatens to win the queen after Bd3+ next move (since White's queen is pinned to the king)\n- If White moves the queen, we maintain strong pressure\n- The bishop becomes extremely active on e4, eyeing both the king and queen\n- It prevents White from castling\n- It maintains all of Black's attacking potential while improving piece coordination\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White some counterplay. The bishop move to e4 is both aggressive and solid.\n```\ng6e4\n```"
