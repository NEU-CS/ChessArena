When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a knight on f4 and queen on f3, while Black has a queen on g5 and knight on g4.\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g7 with limited pawn cover. White's king is on c1, also somewhat exposed.\n3. Immediate threats:\n   - White's queen on f3 is attacking Black's knight on g4\n   - White's knight on f4 is threatening to capture the pawn on d5 (but it's protected by the c5 pawn)\n   - Black's queen on g5 is eyeing the c1 king along the diagonal\n4. Key observations:\n   - White's rook on g1 is very active\n   - Black's rook on a8 is inactive\n   - Black's knight on g4 is under attack and needs to be addressed\n5. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - g4h6: Moves the knight to safety while maintaining pressure\n   - g5f5: Queen move that maintains pressure on the diagonal\n   - g5d8: Queen retreat to defend the back rank\n   - a8a7: Activating the rook\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g4h6 seems best as it saves the knight while maintaining pressure on f5 and potentially threatening to go to f7 later\n- g5f5 would leave the knight hanging after Qxg4\n- a8a7 is too slow and doesn't address the immediate threat\n- Other moves either lose material or don't improve Black's position\nThe move g4h6 also prevents White from playing Qh5+ which could be dangerous.\n```\ng4h6\n```"
