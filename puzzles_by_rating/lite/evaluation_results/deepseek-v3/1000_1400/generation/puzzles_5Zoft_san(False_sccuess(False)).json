When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (both have all pieces except a pawn difference)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong bishop on f4 pointing at black's kingside\n- Black has a bishop pair (both bishops active)\n- White's pawn on f5 is advanced but potentially weak\n- Black's knight on e7 is somewhat passive\n- White has castled queenside while black has castled kingside\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7g6: Developing the knight to a better square, attacking the f4 bishop\n- c5d4: Centralizing the bishop and creating threats\n- c6e5: Improving the knight's position\n- g7g6: Challenging the f5 pawn\n4. Evaluating the best options:\n- e7g6 looks tempting as it develops the knight and attacks the bishop, but after Nxg6 hxg6, white gets the h-file open which could be dangerous\n- c5d4 is interesting but after cxd4 Nxd4, white gets good central control\n- c6e5 seems solid, centralizing the knight and preparing to support d7-d5 push\n- g7g6 is probably best, challenging the f5 pawn immediately and opening the diagonal for the bishop\nAfter considering all options, g7g6 seems most principled:\n- It challenges white's advanced pawn\n- Opens the diagonal for the dark-squared bishop\n- Maintains flexibility in the position\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\nThe move also fits well with typical Sicilian structures where black wants to challenge white's central pawns.\nHere's the move:\n```\ng7g6\n```"
