When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully.\nThe FEN shows it's White's turn (the \"w\" in the notation). Let's assess the position:\nMaterial:\n- White has Q+R+N+2P vs Black's Q+B+3P\n- White is up a rook for a bishop, which is a significant material advantage.\nKey features:\n1. White's queen on a7 and rook on h7 are very active.\n2. Black's king is exposed on f8.\n3. Black has a queen on e1 and bishop on c6.\n4. White has a knight on g5 and pawns on b2, a2, g3, h3.\n5. Black has pawns on b5, f5, g6.\nPotential threats:\n- Black's queen on e1 is eyeing g3 and h1 squares.\n- Black could potentially create threats with ...Qe1xg3+.\nNow let's evaluate the legal moves:\n1. g5e4:\n   - Moves the knight to e4, attacking black's queen.\n   - Black would likely play Qe1xe4, trading queens.\n   - After Qa7xe4, we'd be up a rook for bishop in the endgame, which should be winning.\n2. g5f3:\n   - Blocks the potential ...Qxg3+ threat.\n   - But this seems passive and doesn't improve our position.\n3. f2f3:\n   - Also blocks the ...Qxg3+ threat.\n   - But this weakens our king position and doesn't create any threats.\nThe best move appears to be g5e4, forcing a queen trade that simplifies into a winning endgame. After:\n- g5e4 Qe1xe4\n- Qa7xe4\nWe'd have R+N vs B with pawns, which should be easily winning. The rook and knight can coordinate to pick off black's pawns while our king can advance.\nThe other moves don't create any threats or progress our advantage. Therefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5e4\n```"
