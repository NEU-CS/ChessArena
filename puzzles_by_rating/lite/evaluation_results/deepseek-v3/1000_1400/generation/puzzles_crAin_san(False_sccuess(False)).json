When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (both have a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and pawns). White has a bishop pair which could be a long-term advantage.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a bishop on b5 attacking the knight on c6\n- Black has a knight on e4 which is currently unprotected\n- White's queen on e2 is very active\n- Black's king is still in the center while White can castle kingside\n- Black has a pawn on d4 which could become weak\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) b5c6 - trading bishop for knight, but this would give up the bishop pair\nb) f3e5 - attacking the bishop on e6, but this allows Black to play ...d3\nc) f3d4 - capturing the pawn, but this seems premature\nd) e1g1 - castling to safety\ne) f3g5 - developing the knight with tempo on e6\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Castling (e1g1) is solid but doesn't take advantage of the immediate opportunity\n- f3g5 looks interesting as it develops the knight with tempo, attacking the bishop on e6\n- After f3g5, if Black moves the bishop (say to d7), then White can castle and maintain pressure\n- The pawn on d4 is a potential weakness that can be targeted later\nThe most active and promising move seems to be f3g5, developing with tempo and maintaining pressure while keeping all options open.\n```\nf3g5\n```"
