Material count:\n- White has Q, 2P, B, 2R, K\n- Black has R, N, P, Q, K\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces and passed pawns.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a dangerous passed pawn on d5\n- Black's queen is very active on e2, attacking White's king\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on c2\n- Black has a rook on b8 that could become active\n3. Candidate moves:\na) c2c3 - moves king away from attack but blocks the c-file for rooks\nb) c2c1 - moves king to corner, but might be safer\nc) d1d2 - blocks the queen's attack with the rook\nLet's evaluate each:\na) c2c3:\n- Gets king away from immediate danger\n- But blocks coordination between rooks\n- Black could play Qe2xc2+ next move\nb) c2c1:\n- King is safer in corner\n- But very passive and cuts off rook's retreat\n- Black could play Qe2xc2+ anyway with discovered check\nc) d1d2:\n- Blocks the queen's attack immediately\n- After Qe2xd2+, Kxd2 and White is up material\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White can double rooks on d-file\nThe best move is d1d2 as it:\n1. Immediately stops the queen's attack\n2. Leads to favorable exchanges if Black takes\n3. Maintains active piece coordination\n```\nd1d2\n```"

Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop, pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, knight, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White may be slightly better due to more active pieces)\n2.

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's queen is very active on c4, attacking d4 pawn and eyeing the white king\n- White's queen on a7 is somewhat out of play\n- Black has a rook on b8 that could become active\n4. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen is threatening to take d4 pawn\n- White needs to protect the king while maintaining the position\n5. The only legal move is c2d1 (Rook from c2 to d1):\n- This defends the d4 pawn indirectly (if Qxd4, then Rxd1+ wins the queen)\n- It also connects the rooks and brings the rook to a more active position\n- The king remains somewhat exposed, but this is the only reasonable move\nOther considerations:\n- If we had other moves, we might consider Qa7-b7 to activate the queen\n- Or perhaps Kd2-c1 to get the king to safety\n- But with only c2d1 available, this is clearly the best move\nThe move protects our pawn while maintaining some coordination between our pieces. Black will have to be careful about their queen's safety after this move.\n```\nc2d1\n```"
