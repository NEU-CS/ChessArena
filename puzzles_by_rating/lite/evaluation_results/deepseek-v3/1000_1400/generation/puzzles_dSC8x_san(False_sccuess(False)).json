When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h1, while Black's king is on h4 - also exposed but slightly better protected.\n3. Immediate threats: Black's queen is attacking White's bishop on d3. The pawn on f6 protects against Qxf7 ideas.\n4. Key observations:\n- White's queen is very active on d5\n- Black's queen is pinning the bishop to the king\n- Black's king is vulnerable to checks\n5. Candidate moves:\na) Qg8+ - forces the black king to move (Kh5 or Kg5)\nb) Qf7 - attacks the f6 pawn while defending the bishop\nc) Qe6 - centralizes the queen\nd) Bd3 moves - but most lose material\n6. Best move seems Qg8+:\n- After Qg8+ Kh5, we have Qh8+ Kg5 Qg7+ with perpetual check\n- Or Qg8+ Kg5 Qg7+ Kf5 Qf7+ Ke5 Qe6+ with strong pressure\n- This maintains the initiative and prevents Black from consolidating\nThe move Qg8+ keeps the initiative and prevents Black from exploiting the pin on the bishop. Other moves either lose material or allow Black to consolidate their position.\n```\nd5g8\n```"
