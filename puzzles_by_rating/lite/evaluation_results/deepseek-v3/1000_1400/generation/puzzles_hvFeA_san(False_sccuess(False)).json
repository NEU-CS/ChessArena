When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has 2 rooks, 1 pawn, 1 queen vs Black's king, bishop, queen, 4 pawns\n- White is up a rook but down several pawns\n2. Positional factors:\n- White's rooks are very active (e7 and c7)\n- Black's queen is centralized but somewhat exposed\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but Black's pieces aren't coordinated to attack it\n- Black's bishop is passive on g8\n3. Candidate moves:\na) h1g1 - King moves to g1. This seems passive and doesn't improve our position.\nb) e7e4 - Rook moves to e4, attacking the black queen. This looks promising as it forces the queen to move or be captured.\nc) h3g2 - Queen moves to g2. This seems less active and doesn't create immediate threats.\n4. Analysis of e7e4:\n- After e7e4, Black's queen must move or be captured\n- If queen moves (say to d4), we can play Rxd4, winning the queen for a rook\n- If queen doesn't move, we take it with a rook\n- In either case, we gain material advantage\n5. Other considerations:\n- The h3g2 move doesn't create any immediate threats\n- King move is too passive\n- e7e4 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for Black\nConclusion: e7e4 is the strongest move as it either wins the queen or forces Black to give up material.\n```\ne7e4\n```"
