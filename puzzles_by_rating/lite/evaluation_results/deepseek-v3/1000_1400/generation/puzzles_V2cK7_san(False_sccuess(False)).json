When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The position is a pawn endgame with:\n- Black has pawns on a5, b6, c5, d6 and king on f4\n- White has pawns on a4, b3, c4, d5 and king on h3\nKey observations:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have 4 pawns)\n2. White has a passed pawn on d5\n3. Black's king is more active (centralized)\n4. White's king is somewhat restricted on h3\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n1. f4g5 - King moves towards white's pawns but might allow white counterplay\n2. f4f5 - Advances king but doesn't address the passed d-pawn\n3. f4e5 - Best move! Centralizes king and blocks the dangerous d-pawn\n4. f4e4 - Doesn't make progress\n5. f4f3 - Retreats king unnecessarily\n6. f4e3 - Also retreats king\n7. b6b5 - Creates a passed pawn but allows d5-d6 which is dangerous\nThe most principled move is f4e5, which:\n- Blocks the passed d-pawn\n- Centralizes the king\n- Prepheres to support the advance of Black's own pawns\n- Limits White's counterplay\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or unnecessarily retreat the king. The pawn push b6b5 looks tempting but is premature as it allows White to push d6, creating a dangerous passed pawn.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf4e5\n```"
