When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's knight on e4 is very strong, controlling many squares\n- Black has connected passed pawns on the c and d files\n- White's rooks are somewhat passive\n- White's king is exposed on f1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g8\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play ...d4 next, gaining more space\n- Black's knight could jump to g3 or d2 if given the chance\n- Black's pawns could advance if not restrained\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e2e4: Challenges the knight, but after ...Nxf2! is very strong for Black\n- e2e3: Solid, but doesn't improve our position\n- a1a2: Gets the rook more active\n- f1g1: King safety\n- h3h4: Prepares g4 to challenge the knight\n- g2g3: Prevents ...Ng3 ideas\n5. Best move seems to be f1g1, improving king safety first. Other moves either don't improve our position or allow tactical problems.\nAfter f1g1, we can think about activating our rooks next. The immediate e2e4 is too risky due to ...Nxf2 winning material.\n```\nf1g1\n```"
