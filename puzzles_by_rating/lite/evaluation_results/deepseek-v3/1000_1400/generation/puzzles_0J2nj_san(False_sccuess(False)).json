When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have pawns only. White has 5 pawns vs Black's 4. White's king is more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is centralized at f5\n- Black's king is at d5\n- Both sides have passed pawns (White's g-pawn, Black's b-pawn)\n- White has a protected passed pawn at g4\n- Black has a protected passed pawn at b5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5f6: Advances king towards black's pawns\n- g4g5: Pushes the protected passed pawn\n- f5g5: King supports g-pawn advance\n- h3h4: Prepares to create another passed pawn\n4. Evaluation:\n- g4g5 looks tempting to push the passed pawn, but after ...h6 it's not clear\n- f5f6 seems strong, bringing the king closer to both black's pawns and potential queening squares\n- f5g5 is also good, supporting the g-pawn advance\n- Other moves don't seem as purposeful\n5. After f5f6:\n- Black's king can't stop both white's g-pawn and king's approach\n- If ...Kd6, then g5 and white's king can support the pawn\n- If ...Kc5, then Ke7 heading towards black's pawns\nThis seems like the most direct winning plan - centralize the king further while keeping options to support the g-pawn or attack black's pawns.\n```\nf5f6\n```"
