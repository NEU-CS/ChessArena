When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, bishop, 3 pawns vs Black's queen, rook, pawn\n- White is up a bishop and pawn, but Black has active pieces\n2. King safety:\n- White king is on h3, somewhat exposed\n- Black king is on d6, relatively safe\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black has Qf2 threatening mate on h2\n- Black's rook on e3 is attacking the f3 bishop\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qh7: threatens Qh8# but Black can play Qh2+ first\n- Qf7: blocks the f2 queen's path to h2\n- Qe7: forks king and rook but allows Qh2+ first\n- Qd7+: forces king movement but loses queen after Kxd7\n- g5: pushes passed pawn but doesn't address immediate threat\n5. Best move analysis:\n- Qf7 is most forcing as it blocks the mate threat while maintaining our own threats\n- After Qf7, if Qxf7, then Bxe3 wins the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, we maintain control and can push pawns\n6. Other options:\n- Qh7 allows Qh2+ Kg4 Qh5#\n- Qe7 allows Qh2+ Kg4 Qh5#\n- Pawn pushes don't address the immediate threat\nThe best move is to block the mate threat while maintaining our material advantage and threats. \n```\ng7f7\n```"
