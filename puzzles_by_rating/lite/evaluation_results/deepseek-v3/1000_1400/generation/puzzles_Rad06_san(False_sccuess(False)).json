When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black has a strong knight on d5\n- White has pressure on the g-file with rook and queen\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed d6 pawn\n- Black has a queenside pawn majority\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) King safety: f8g8 or h8g8 to connect rooks and protect the king\nb) Counterplay: d5e3 or d5f4 to activate the knight\nc) Pawn breaks: c5c4 to challenge White's center\nd) Queen moves: d8e7 to defend the d6 pawn\n4. Evaluation:\n- f8g8 looks solid but passive\n- d5e3 is tempting but after Nxe3 dxe3, White gets strong central control\n- c5c4 could be good but after dxc4 bxc4, White's pieces become more active\n- d8e7 seems most flexible, defending d6 while keeping options open\n5. Best move: d8e7\n- Defends the d6 pawn\n- Keeps the queen active\n- Prepares potential ...Qe7-g7 to challenge White's queen\n- Maintains flexibility for future plans\nAfter d8e7, if White plays Qg4 then ...Qxg4 hxg4 would lead to an endgame where Black's queenside majority could become significant.\n```\nd8e7\n```"
