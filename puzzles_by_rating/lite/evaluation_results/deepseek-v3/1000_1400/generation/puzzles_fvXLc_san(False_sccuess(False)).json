When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a rook, bishop, knight, queen and pawns vs White's equivalent). However, White has a very active knight on e7 that's threatening Black's position.\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8 with White's pieces well-coordinated around it. White has potential threats like Qh5 or Ng6+.\n3. Immediate threats: White's knight on e7 is a major problem - it's attacking Black's queen and rook simultaneously. The queen must move, but any queen move allows Nxg7 forking king and rook.\n4. Possible defenses:\n   - Moving the queen to e6 or e5 would allow Nxg7+\n   - Moving the queen to h6 would allow Qh5 with strong mating threats\n   - Moving the queen to g6 seems best, but then f7 is hanging to Nxg7\n   - Moving the rook to e8 would block the queen's defense of g7\n5. Best defensive idea: We need to address both the threat to our queen and the potential Nxg7 threat. The only way to do both is to move the queen to e7, exchanging it for the knight, though this leads to a worse endgame.\n6. Alternative idea: We could try to counterattack with ...Qh6, but after Qh5 Qxh5 Nxg7+ Kg8 Nxh5, we're down material.\nAfter careful consideration, the best practical choice is to exchange queens on e7, even though it leads to a slightly worse endgame, because all other options lead to immediate material loss or mate threats.\nThe move is:\n```\nd6e7\n```"
