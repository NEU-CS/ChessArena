When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Queen, Knight, 3 pawns, King\n- Black has: Queen, Rook, 4 pawns, King\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with Queen vs Rook+pawn)\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d8\n- Black's queen is on g7, defending the h8 promotion square\n- Black's rook is on c1, potentially threatening to invade\n- Both kings are somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed pawn on b5\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qd8xh8+ if Black's queen moves\n- Black can consider rook moves to create counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\na) g7h8 - would lose the queen to Qxh8\nb) c1c8 - pinning the queen to the king, but Qd8xc8 Qxc8 is equal\nc) c1h1 - threatening mate on h2\nd) g6g5 - moving the king away from potential checks\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c1h1 looks most promising as it creates immediate threats against White's king\n- After c1h1, White must respond to the mate threat on h2\n- White would likely play Kh2, after which we can consider Qg7xg2+ with strong counterplay\nThe move c1h1 creates the most immediate threats and maintains our active pieces. Other moves either lose material or don't create enough counterplay.\nHere's the move:\n```\nc1h1\n```"
