When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on c4\n- Black's queen is on f2, attacking the undefended pawn on b2\n- Black has a rook on e8 controlling the e-file\n- White has a passed h-pawn on h6 which is very dangerous\n- White's rook on h1 is very active and can potentially join the attack\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qxb2 from Black\n- White can create threats against Black's king which is somewhat exposed on h8\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c4g8: Queen sacrifice to deflect the rook from e8\n- h1h5: Rook lift to join the attack\n- c4f7: Threatening mate with Qg8#\n- d1g1: Defending the b2 pawn while activating the rook\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c4g8! is very strong. After 1...Rxg8 2.hxg7+ Rxg7 3.Rh8# it's mate.\n- If Black doesn't take the queen with 1...Qxg8 then 2.Qxe8+ wins material.\n- Other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black counterplay.\nThe most forcing and winning move is the queen sacrifice:\n```\nc4g8\n```"
