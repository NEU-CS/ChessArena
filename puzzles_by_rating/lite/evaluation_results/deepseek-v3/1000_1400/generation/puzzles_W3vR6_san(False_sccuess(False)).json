When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (b8), Queen (f4), Rook (f1), pawn (g2, h3)\n- Black has: Rook (a7), Queen (a3), Knight (c2), Rook (f8), pawns (g7, h7, e6)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a more active position with threats.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on f4 is eyeing the c7 square (potential fork)\n- Black's knight on c2 is well placed, attacking White's rook on f1\n- Black's queen is very active on a3, pinning White's g2 pawn to the king\n- White's rook on b8 is threatening to invade the 7th rank\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qc7, forking the rook and king\n- White might play Rxf8+ followed by Qxf8, winning material\n- Black needs to be careful about back rank weaknesses\n4. Candidate moves:\na) a3e7 - Queen moves to e7, defending the rook and preventing Qc7\nb) f8e8 - Rook moves to e8, getting off the f-file and defending against Rxf8 ideas\nc) c2e1 - Knight forks the rook and king\nd) a7e7 - Rook moves to e7, defending against Qc7\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c2e1 looks tempting but after Rxe1 Qxe1, White has Qc7+ winning the rook\n- a7e7 is solid but blocks the queen's defense\n- f8e8 is passive\n- a3e7 is the most precise, defending against Qc7 while maintaining the queen's activity\nThe best move is:\n```\na3e7\n```"
