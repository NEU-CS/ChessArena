When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on d6 is very active\n- Black's rook is on e3, attacking the g3 pawn\n- White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h4\n- Black has a passed a-pawn on a6\n- Both kings are active in the center\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6d7: Centralizing the rook further and threatening to penetrate\n- d6g6: Attacking the g6 pawn and potentially creating threats against the black king\n- h4h5: Pushing the passed pawn\n- f4f5: Gaining space and opening lines\n4. Analysis of d6g6:\n- Immediately attacks the g6 pawn\n- If Black takes with hxg6, then h5xg6 opens the h-file for White's rook\n- If Black doesn't take, White can pile up pressure on g6\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7\n5. Analysis of d6d7:\n- Good centralization but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Black can defend with ...Re7 or ...Kf7\n- Less forcing than d6g6\n6. Analysis of h4h5:\n- Pushes the passed pawn but allows Black counterplay with ...Rxg3+\n- After h5xg6 Rxg3+ Kf4 Rg4+ Ke3 Rxh4, Black wins a pawn\n7. Analysis of f4f5:\n- Opens lines but gives Black's rook more scope on e3\n- Black can play ...hxg5 with counterplay\nAfter careful consideration, d6g6 seems the most forcing and promising move, creating immediate threats against Black's position while maintaining White's activity advantage.\n```\nd6g6\n```"
