When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on h5, eyeing the f7 pawn\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n- White has a strong pawn center (d4, e4)\n- Black's dark-squared bishop is very strong on b6, controlling key central squares\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qxf7+ or Ng4 ideas\n- Black needs to address the immediate pressure while developing counterplay\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7g6: Pushes the pawn to challenge the queen, but weakens dark squares\n- d8e7: Develops the queen to a safer square, connects rooks\n- b6d4: Bishop sacrifice to disrupt White's center\n- c8g4: Pinning the knight to the queen\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g7g6 seems too weakening (Qg4 would maintain pressure)\n- b6d4 is tempting but may not be sound after cxd4\n- c8g4 is interesting but White can play Qg5 maintaining pressure\n- d8e7 is solid and develops the queen while covering f7\nThe best move appears to be d8e7, which:\n- Safely develops the queen\n- Protects the f7 pawn\n- Connects the rooks\n- Maintains flexibility for future plans\nHere's the move:\n```\nd8e7\n```"
