When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, N, 4 pawns\n- Black has: Q, R, 6 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but black's pawns are more advanced.\n2. King safety:\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n- Black's king is safer on g8\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on f2 is attacking the knight on h2\n- Black's rook on g3 is threatening to capture the pawn on g4\n- Black has potential mating threats with Qf2-h2#\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h2f3: Blocks the queen's path to h2 and defends g4 pawn\n- d1f3: Defends g4 pawn and attacks black's queen\n- e1e4: Centralizes the queen but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g4f5: Pawn capture, but opens up the position\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h2f3 seems most urgent as it prevents mate threats and defends g4\n- d1f3 is also good but leaves the knight hanging\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threats\nBest move is h2f3, which:\n1. Blocks the queen's path to h2 (preventing Qf2-h2#)\n2. Defends the g4 pawn from the rook\n3. Maintains control of key squares\n```\nh2f3\n```"
