When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on h7, while White's king is relatively safer on g5.\n3. Key threats:\n   - White has a very dangerous queen on h4 attacking h7\n   - White's rook on e4 is very active\n   - Black's queen on h1 is somewhat trapped\n4. Immediate concerns:\n   - Need to defend against Qh4 threatening mate on h7\n   - Need to activate the black queen\n   - Need to coordinate pieces better\nLooking at candidate moves:\n1. f8h8 - Moving the rook to h8 would block the queen's defense of h7, allowing Qxh7#\n2. f8f7 - This seems better, defending h7 but allows White's rook to infiltrate via e7\n3. h7g7 - Moving the king away from danger, but then Qh6+ is crushing\n4. h1e4 - Trading queens with Qxe4 seems best, removing White's most dangerous piece\nAfter Qxe4 Rxe4:\n- Black's king is safer\n- Material remains equal\n- Black can then activate the rook\nOther moves either allow mate or lose material. Qxe4 is the most forcing and solves multiple problems at once.\n```\nh1e4\n```"
