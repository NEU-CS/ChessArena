When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Knight, Queen, 6 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has minor piece for pawn advantage)\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on h8 (very advanced)\n- Black has a queen on a6 and knight on g3\n- White's bishop pair could become powerful if activated\n- Black's king is still in the center (c8)\n3. Threats:\n- Black's knight on g3 is threatening to capture h1 bishop or fork with Ne2+\n- Black's queen is eyeing the b1 rook\n4. Candidate moves:\na) h8f7 - knight retreat but seems passive\nb) g2f3 - trading knights, but Black's queen could recapture\nc) d2h6 - bishop sacrifice, but not clearly winning\nd) b1b6 - attacking queen while defending b2 pawn\ne) d5c6 - pawn sacrifice to open lines\nAfter careful consideration:\n- b1b6 is very strong as it:\n  * Attacks the black queen\n  * Defends the b2 pawn\n  * Prepares to double rooks on the b-file\n  * Black's queen has few good squares (a5 runs into Bb3+)\nOther moves either don't address the threats or are less active. The bishop sacrifice on h6 doesn't seem to lead to anything concrete yet.\n```\nb1b6\n```"
