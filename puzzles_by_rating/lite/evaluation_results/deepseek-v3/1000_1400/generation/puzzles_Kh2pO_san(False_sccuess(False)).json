When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Rook, Queen, and pawns), but Black has more active pieces.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8, while White's king is on g1 with some protection.\n3. Key features:\n   - Black has a strong queen on h4 eyeing the h2 pawn and potentially the g3 square.\n   - White's queen on e3 is defending the rook on g3.\n   - Black's rook on f6 is very active and can potentially swing to h6 or other squares.\n   - The passed h-pawn on h5 could become dangerous if advanced.\n4. Threats:\n   - Black's immediate threat is Qxh2, but this would be met with Rxh4 Rxf6, which seems roughly equal.\n   - White has potential threats like Qe7+ or Qh6, but nothing immediate.\n5. Candidate moves:\n   - Qxh2: As mentioned, leads to exchanges but doesn't seem clearly winning.\n   - Rf6h6: Prepares to double on the h-file and increase pressure on h2.\n   - Rf6f3: Pinning the g3 rook to the queen.\n   - Qh3: Keeping pressure on h2 while moving the queen to a safer square.\nAfter careful consideration, Rf6h6 seems the most promising:\n- It prepares to double rooks on the h-file\n- Maintains all threats against h2\n- The rook on h6 also defends h7 in case of Qh6 ideas\n- It keeps maximum pressure on White's position\nOther moves either lead to exchanges or don't improve Black's position as much.\n```\nf6h6\n```"
