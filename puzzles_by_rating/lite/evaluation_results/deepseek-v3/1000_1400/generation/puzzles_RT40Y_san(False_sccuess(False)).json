When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed on g8\n3. White has a passed pawn on b5, but it's currently blocked by b6\n4. Black's rook on a7 is passive, while White's rooks are more active\n5. Black's knight on a4 is somewhat out of play\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f1f8 - Rook to the 8th rank, pinning White's king\n2. a7f7 - Activating the rook to a more central position\n3. g8h7 - Moving the king to a safer square\n4. a4c3 - Bringing the knight into play\nLet me evaluate these:\n1. f1f8 looks very strong:\n- Pins White's king to the e-file\n- Threatens to win the rook on g6 with f8g8+\n- After f8g8+, Kxg8 Rxa7 and Black is up material\n- White's best reply would be Ke3, but then f8g8+ still wins\n2. a7f7:\n- Activates the rook but doesn't create immediate threats\n- White can respond with Rg8+ forcing Kh7\n- Not as forcing as f1f8\n3. g8h7:\n- Gets the king to safety but doesn't improve Black's position\n- White can continue improving their position\n4. a4c3:\n- Develops the knight but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- White can play Rg8+ with a strong attack\nAfter careful consideration, f1f8 is clearly the strongest move as it creates immediate threats and wins material. White has no good way to defend against the threat of f8g8+ winning the rook.\n```\nf1f8\n```"
