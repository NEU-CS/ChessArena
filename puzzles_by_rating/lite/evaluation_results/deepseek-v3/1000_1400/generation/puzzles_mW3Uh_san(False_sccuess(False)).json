When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (c5), Bishop (b2), 3 pawns (a4, e3, h2), King (g1)\n- Black has: Rook (d8), Bishop (b1), 2 pawns (a7, g6), King (h6)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces and better pawn structure.\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on c5\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h6\n- Black's bishop on b1 is very passive\n- White has passed pawns on a4 and e3\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Rook moves:\n- c5c8 - attacking the black rook (but black can just move it)\n- c5h5 - pinning the black king to the bishop (very strong)\n- c5g5 - also pinning the king to the bishop\nb) Bishop moves:\n- b2h8 - threatening mate (but black can defend with Rf8)\n- b2f6 - attacking the pawn and controlling important squares\nc) King moves:\n- g1g2 - centralizing the king\n4. Best move analysis:\n- c5h5 is very strong because:\n  * It pins the black bishop to the king\n  * Black cannot capture the rook due to b2h8 mate\n  * Black's only reasonable response is to move the king, allowing White to win the bishop\n  * Even if black tries Rf8, White can play b2f6 with strong threats\nOther moves like c5c8 or b2h8 are less forcing and give black more options.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc5h5\n```"
