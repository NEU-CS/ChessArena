When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has bishop pair vs White's bishop + knight, but pawns are equal)\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong pawn center with e5 and f4 pawns\n- Black's dark-squared bishop is very active on d4\n- White's c6 bishop is strong but could be traded\n- Black's rooks are not optimally placed (c8 and h8)\n- White's king is exposed on e2\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8/h8f8/h8e8/h8d8 - Rook moves to centralize\n- c8d7 - Developing the bishop to a more active square\n- d4e5 - Trading bishops, but this would give White a strong pawn center\n- d4c5 - Pressuring the b4 square and maintaining the bishop's activity\n- b6b5 - Pawn push to gain space on queenside\n4. Evaluation:\n- The most critical factor is Black's active bishop on d4. We should try to maintain its activity.\n- Trading it (d4e5) would relieve pressure and give White a strong center.\n- Centralizing the rook (h8e8) seems sensible to connect rooks.\n- The move d4c5 maintains bishop activity while preventing White's b4 ideas.\n5. Best move: d4c5\n- Maintains the strong bishop\n- Puts pressure on b4 and e3 squares\n- Prepares potential ...b5-b4 pawn pushes\n- Keins options open for rook centralization next move\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\nd4c5\n```"
