When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count: Both sides have equal material (Q+R+B+N vs Q+R+B+N), but White has a more active position with better piece coordination.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on a1 and bishop on c4 are eyeing the black king's position\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- Black's rooks are not well coordinated (a5 and a8)\n- White has a strong knight on f4 controlling key squares\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qa1-f6 threatening mate\n- White could also consider moves like Rf1-f3 or g2-g4 to increase pressure\n4. Candidate moves for Black:\na) King safety: g8f8 - moves the king away from potential checks\nb) Counterplay: c7e5 - queen centralization, attacking the knight\nc) Defensive: c8d7 - developing the bishop to defend\nAfter evaluating:\n- g8f8 is too passive and allows White to build up pressure\n- c7e5 looks interesting but after Nxe6! White gets a strong initiative\n- c8d7 seems most solid, developing the bishop while keeping defensive options\nThe best move appears to be c8d7, developing the bishop and preparing to possibly bring the rook into play via d8 later. It also prevents any immediate tactical threats from White.\n```\nc8d7\n```"
