When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook on b8, queen on c7, bishop on f6, and pawns on d5, e4, c3, g7, h7.\n3. White has a queen on a4, rook on c1, pawns on e3, g3, h2, f2 (king is at g2).\n4. Black has a passed pawn on e4 that could become dangerous.\n5. White's queen is attacking the c3 pawn, but it's defended by the bishop on f6.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b8e8 - Rook to e8 to support the e4 pawn's advance\n2. c7e5 - Queen centralization, attacking g3 pawn\n3. f6e5 - Bishop move, attacking white's rook\n4. e6e5 - Pawn move, opening bishop's diagonal\nAfter careful consideration:\n- b8e8 looks interesting as it supports the e-pawn's advance to e3, which could be very strong.\n- c7e5 is tempting but allows white to play Qxc3 with discovered attack on the queen.\n- f6e5 attacks the rook but after Rxc3, black's position becomes messy.\n- e6e5 weakens the dark squares.\nThe best move appears to be b8e8, supporting the e-pawn's advance while keeping all pieces coordinated. The e4 pawn is a key asset in this position and supporting its advance could create serious threats against white's king.\n```\nb8e8\n```"
