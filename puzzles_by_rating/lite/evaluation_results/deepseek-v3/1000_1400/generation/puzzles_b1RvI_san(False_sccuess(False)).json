When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Rook vs Black's Rook, Bishop. Material is equal but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a rook on h8 pinning the black king to the rook on e8\n- White has another rook on c7 very actively placed\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Trading rooks would relieve pressure but leave White with a small advantage\n- c7e7: Challenging the black rook directly\n- c7h7: Creating a battery with the h8 rook\n- h3h4: Preparing to push the h-pawn to create threats\n4. Best move analysis:\n- h8g8 seems tempting but after Rxe8 Kxe8, Black's king becomes active\n- c7e7 is strong - after Rxe7 Bxe7, White can play Rh7 pinning the bishop\n- c7h7 creates immediate threats - if Black doesn't defend properly, Rh7 could be deadly\n- h3h4 is too slow given Black's passed pawn\nBetween c7e7 and c7h7, c7h7 is more forcing and creates immediate threats. After c7h7:\n- If Black plays Rxh7, then Rxh7 and White has a winning rook endgame\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Rh7 with devastating effect\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc7h7\n```"
