When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, queen, rook and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a knight on c7 that's very active\n- Black has a knight on d4 that's well placed\n- White's bishop on a6 is strong, controlling the long diagonal\n- Black's queen on d8 is somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7e8 (knight fork attacking queen and king)\n- c3d4 (queen takes knight)\n- a6b7 (bishop takes rook)\n- f4e5 (pawn takes pawn)\n4. Deep analysis:\n- c7e8 looks very tempting as it forks queen and king. After Qxe8, Rxe8 Kxe8, White wins the queen for rook and knight, but Black gets counterplay with the bishop pair.\n- c3d4 Qxd4 exd4 leaves White with doubled isolated pawns but removes Black's strong knight.\n- a6b7 Rxb7 Nxb7 gives White rook for bishop but leaves Black's queen very active.\n- f4e5 dxe5 opens the d-file for Black's rook.\n5. Best move:\nc7e8 is the most forcing and disruptive move. Even though it leads to an exchange of queen for rook+knight, it disrupts Black's coordination and leaves White with active pieces. The passed e-pawn also becomes more dangerous after this exchange.\nAfter 21. Nce8 Qxe8 22. Rxe8 Kxe8, White has Q+R vs Q+B+N but with better pawn structure and active pieces.\n```\nc7e8\n```"
