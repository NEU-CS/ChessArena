When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White: Queen, Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black: Queen, Rook, 2 pawns\nWhite is up a bishop and pawn, but Black has some counterplay with the a2 queen and c2 rook.\n2. King safety:\n- White king is relatively safe on f2\n- Black king is exposed on g8\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on a2 is threatening mate in 1 (Qa1#)\n- White's queen on e5 is very active and can deliver checks\n- Black's rook on c2 is pinning the e2 bishop to the king\n4. Immediate threats:\n- Must prevent Qa1# first and foremost\n- Need to deal with the pin on the bishop\n5. Candidate moves:\na) Defending against mate:\n- e1a1 (rook blocks) but then Rxa1 and we lose material\n- f2g3 (king moves) but allows Qxf2+ next move\n- e5a1 (queen blocks) is interesting but Qxa1 is forced\nb) Counterplay with checks:\n- e5h8+ looks very strong: Kh8 is forced, then we can play Qh5+ with a discovered attack on the rook\n- e5g7+ is also possible but less forcing\nAfter calculating:\n- e5h8+ Kh8 (forced)\n- Qh5+ Kg8\n- Qxc2 wins the rook and maintains the material advantage\n- Black has no immediate threats after this sequence\nOther options either don't solve the mate threat or lead to worse positions. The forcing line with e5h8+ seems best.\n```\ne5h8\n```"
