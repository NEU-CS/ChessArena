When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, queen vs White's queen, knight, rook). \n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on b7, while White's king is on c2 - both somewhat vulnerable.\n3. Key features:\n   - Black's bishop on h4 is very active, pinning White's pawn on f2 to the king\n   - White has a strong knight on e4 and queen on b3 putting pressure\n   - Black's rook on g8 is currently passive\n   - White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - h4g3: Maintains the pin and threatens to win the f2 pawn\n   - g8g2: Rook infiltration, attacking the weak pawns\n   - d7d5: Central break, but might open lines for White\n   - b7c8: Moving the king to safety\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h4g3 looks very strong as it maintains the pin and threatens to win material\n- g8g2 is tempting but White can defend with Kd2\n- Other moves either don't improve our position or create weaknesses\nThe best move is to maintain the pin and increase pressure on White's position with:\n```\nh4g3\n```"
