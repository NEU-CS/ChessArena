When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is on a6, rook on b7, pawn on b5, pawn on a4\n3. White has queen on c6, rook on b1, pawn on h3, pawn on g2, king on h1\n4. White's queen is attacking Black's rook on b7\n5. White's rook on b1 is also attacking Black's rook on b7\n6. Black's king is in a precarious position near the edge\nLet's evaluate the legal moves:\na6a7 (King moves forward):\n- Moves king closer to center but still vulnerable\n- Doesn't address the double attack on the rook\n- White can play Qxb7 winning the rook\na6a5 (King moves backward):\n- Moves king away from center\n- Still doesn't address the rook attack\n- White can play Qxb7 winning the rook\nb7b6 (Rook moves down):\n- Gets the rook out of immediate danger from both queen and rook\n- Maintains some activity for the rook\n- King remains somewhat exposed but not immediately threatened\nThe best move is b7b6 because:\n1. It saves the rook from being captured immediately\n2. The rook remains active and can potentially counterattack\n3. Other moves lose material immediately\n4. While the position remains difficult, this prolongs the game\n```\nb7b6\n```"
