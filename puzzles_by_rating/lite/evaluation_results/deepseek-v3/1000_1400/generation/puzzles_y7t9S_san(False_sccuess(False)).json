When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight, and pawns)\n2. White has a very active knight on f5 attacking black's weak squares\n3. Black has a knight on e3 that looks dangerous but is currently pinned to the queen by White's bishop on d3\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White has castled\n5. Black has some pressure along the e-file and dark squares\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) f5g7 - Forking queen and rook, but black can play Qxg7\nB) f5e7+ - Discovered attack on black's queen while checking the king\nC) d3b5 - Pinning the b7 bishop to the queen\nD) c3d5 - Centralizing the knight with threats\nLet's analyze f5e7+ in depth:\n- After f5e7+, black must move the king (Ke8 is forced)\n- Then we can capture the queen with e7c7 winning material\n- Black's best response would be Qxc7 Bxc7, but we win the queen for a knight and bishop\n- Black's position would collapse as their king is exposed\nOther moves:\n- f5g7 allows Qxg7 and we don't gain material\n- d3b5 is interesting but black can play Bc6 or a6\n- c3d5 is solid but doesn't exploit the immediate tactical opportunity\nThe move f5e7+ is the most forcing and wins material immediately. It's the best move in this position.\n```\nf5e7\n```"
