When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except White has an extra pawn)\n2. White has a slight space advantage with pawns on c4/d4 vs Black's d5/c6\n3. Black's dark-squared bishop is very active on g4, pinning the f3 knight\n4. White's light-squared bishop is well-placed on g5, putting pressure on f6\n5. Black's king is still in the center while White's is castled\nKey observations:\n- The pin on f3 is uncomfortable and should be addressed\n- Black's bishop on g4 is a key defender of their position\n- We have potential to open the position with c4-c5 or cxd5\n- The g5 bishop is a strong piece that could be used to create threats\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5h6 - trading the bishop for the knight, but this gives Black the bishop pair\n2. g5f6 - also trading, but Black can recapture with the g7 bishop\n3. h2h3 - challenging the bishop, but Black can play Bh5 maintaining the pin\n4. c4d5 - opening the center, which might favor White's better development\n5. f3e5 - a tactical shot that looks interesting\nAfter careful consideration, f3e5 seems very promising:\n- It attacks the pinned bishop on g4\n- If Black takes the knight (dxe5), we have Bxe7 winning material\n- If Black moves the bishop (Bxe5), we have dxe5 opening the d-file\n- Other bishop moves allow us to win the exchange with Bxf6\nThis move both breaks the pin and creates immediate threats. Let's calculate some lines:\n1. f3e5 Bxe5 2. dxe5 Ng4 3. Qd4! with strong pressure\n2. f3e5 dxe5 3. Bxe7 Qxe7 4. dxe5 and White is better\n3. f3e5 Bh5 4. e6! fxe6 5. Bxf6 Bxf6 6. Qd4 with advantage\nAll lines seem favorable for White. Therefore, the best move is:\n```\nf3e5\n```"
