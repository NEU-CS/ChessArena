When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (f5), King (e5), Bishop (g4), Rook (c1), pawns (a5, b4, h5)\n- White has: Rook (d5), Rook (d2), Bishop (d7), King (f2), pawns (a2, b3, h4)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is very active in the center (e5)\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on f2\n- Black has two rooks vs White's two rooks, but Black's rooks are more active\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning White's rook on d2 to the king\n- White's bishop on d7 is blocked by its own pawn on b3\n3. Candidate moves:\na) f5g6 - Rook moves to g6, attacking the h4 pawn\nb) f5f4 - Rook moves forward, increasing pressure\nc) f5e4 - Rook moves to e4, centralizing and attacking the d2 rook\nAnalysis:\n- f5g6: After Rxh4, White can play Rd4 with counterplay\n- f5f4: Puts more pressure on f2, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- f5e4: Most forcing move - attacks the d2 rook while maintaining all threats\nBest move is f5e4, as it:\n1. Attacks the pinned rook on d2\n2. Centralizes the rook\n3. Maintains all other threats\n4. White has no good way to defend the rook (if Rd1, then Rxd1 wins material)\n```\nf5e4\n```"
