Material count:\n- White: Rook (f1), Queen (e2), Pawns (a3,b2,c3,d4,f3,g2,h3)\n- Black: Rook (d5,h5), Queen (g3), Pawns (a6,b5,c4,e6,f7,g7,h7)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces and threats.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on g3 is very dangerous, eyeing h2 mate\n- Black's rooks are active on the d-file and h-file\n- White's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- White's queen is somewhat trapped with limited good squares\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qxh2# if we don't defend\n- Black can also play Rdh5 doubling on the h-file\n- Black has potential for ...Rxd4 or ...cxd3 ideas\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h3h4 - blocks the h-file but weakens g4\nb) f1f2 - defends h2 but blocks the queen\nc) e2f2 - blocks the queen's path to h2\nd) e2e1 - gets the queen to safety\ne) h1g1 - moves the king away\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h3h4 seems too weakening\n- f1f2 blocks our queen's activity\n- e2f2 is the most direct way to prevent mate while keeping the queen active\n- e2e1 is passive and allows Black to increase pressure\n- h1g1 doesn't solve our problems\nThe best move is e2f2, which:\n1. Blocks the queen's path to h2\n2. Keeps the queen active\n3. Maintains control of key squares\n4. Doesn't create new weaknesses\n```\ne2f2\n```"

Immediate threat: Black is threatening Qxh2# (queen takes h2 checkmate)\n2. White's options:\n   - h1g1 (king moves to g1)\n   - g2h3 (queen takes h3 pawn)\nLet's evaluate both options:\n1. h1g1:\n   - Gets the king out of immediate danger\n   - But after 1...Qxh2, white is still in big trouble with black's attack continuing\n   - Black can follow up with Rh1+ etc.\n2. g2h3:\n   - Queen takes the pawn on h3\n   - Removes the immediate mating threat\n   - After Qxh3, if black plays Qxh3, then Rxh3 and white has eliminated black's dangerous queen\n   - White's position remains difficult but more playable\nThe queen capture is more forcing and eliminates black's most dangerous attacking piece. While the position remains difficult, this gives white the best practical chances.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng2h3\n```"
