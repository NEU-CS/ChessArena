When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has king, bishop and 2 pawns vs Black's king, knight and 2 pawns. Material is equal but White's pawns are more advanced.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed a-pawn that's already on the 5th rank\n- Black's e4 knight is well placed but can be challenged\n- Black's king is somewhat restricted by White's bishop\n- Black has connected passed pawns on e5 and g5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: f7g6 looks interesting to attack the e4 knight\n- King moves: b5c4 centralizes the king and threatens to attack the knight\n- Pawn moves: a5a6 advances the passed pawn\n4. Analysis:\n- f7g6: After Bg6, if Nxg3 then Bxe4 and White wins a pawn\n- b5c4: Centralizing the king is good, but Black can play Nxg3\n- a5a6: Pushing the passed pawn is tempting but Black can respond with Kb7\n5. Best move seems to be f7g6, attacking the knight:\n- If Black takes g3 with Nxg3, then Bxe4 wins a pawn\n- If Black moves the knight, we can consider pushing a6 next\n- The bishop is very strong on g6, controlling key squares\nOther options:\n- b5c4 allows Nxg3 which is messy\n- a5a6 is good but not as forcing as Bg6\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf7g6\n```"
