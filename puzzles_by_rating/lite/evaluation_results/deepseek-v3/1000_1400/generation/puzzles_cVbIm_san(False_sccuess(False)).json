When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: Black's king is more exposed than White's, but both kings are somewhat active\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - Black has connected passed pawns on b6 and a7\n   - White has a passed pawn on f4\n   - Black's h-pawn is advanced but isolated\n   - White's pawns on a2, b2, c2 are connected but not advanced\nKey observations:\n- White's rook is actively placed on e2, eyeing the e-file\n- Black's rook on f7 is somewhat passive\n- Black's king is near White's passed f-pawn\n- The position looks roughly equal, but Black has some initiative with the connected passed pawns\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f7f8 - brings rook to more active position, but might be too passive\n2. f6g6 - centralizing the king, but allows White counterplay\n3. b6b5 - advancing the connected passed pawn, which seems most promising\n4. a7a5 - also advancing queenside pawns, but b6b5 seems more direct\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- b6b5 creates immediate pressure on White's position\n- After b5, White would have to deal with the advancing pawns\n- The rook can later support the pawns from b7 if needed\n- Other moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White counterplay\nThe best move is to advance the connected passed pawn:\n```\nb6b5\n```"
