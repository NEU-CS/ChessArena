When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King positions: White king is on d2, Black king on e5. Both kings are active but White's is slightly safer.\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White has pawns on a2 and b2\n   - Black has pawns on d4 and g5\n4. Key features:\n   - Black's knight is centralized on f5\n   - White's rook is very active on d6\n   - Black's d4 pawn is passed but blockaded by White's rook\n   - White has potential to create passed pawns on either queenside\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rook moves:\n   - d6d8: Controls the 8th rank but might be premature\n   - d6f6: Attacks the knight and gains space\n   - d6d5: Puts pressure on e5 and d4\n2. King moves:\n   - d2e2: Centralizes the king\n   - d2c2: Prepares to support queenside pawns\n3. Pawn moves:\n   - b2b4: Creates space and potential passed pawn\n   - a2a4: Similar idea\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d6f6 looks strong as it attacks the knight and gains space. Black would likely respond with knight moves (Nf5-h4 or Nf5-d6), but White can then centralize the king or push pawns.\n- d2e2 is also reasonable to centralize the king.\n- b2b4 creates potential for a passed pawn.\nThe most active and forcing move is d6f6, putting immediate pressure on Black's position.\n```\nd6f6\n```"
