When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop, and some pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, knight, bishop, and pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (White may be slightly better)\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on c8\n- Black has threats with Qg3 attacking h2\n- White's rook on f4 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's bishop on g2 is blocked by its own pawn on h3\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qg3xh3+ winning the pawn\n- Black's rook on h7 could become active\n- White has potential mating threats against the black king\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Qe6e8+ looks tempting to check the king\n- Qe6f7 attacks the rook on h7\n- Qe6d7 attacking the knight\n- Defending against Qg3 with Rf4f3\n- Pushing h3h4 to defend against Qg3\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qe6e8+ forces the king to move (only legal move is Kc8b7)\n- Then we can play Qe8d7+ forking king and knight\n- This sequence wins material while keeping the initiative\nThe best move is:\n```\ne6e8\n```"
