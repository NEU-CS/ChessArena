When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has king + bishop + pawn vs Black's king + knight + pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed d-pawn which could be significant.\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is very active (b5)\n- Black's knight is well placed on e2, controlling key squares\n- Both sides have passed pawns (White's d3, Black's g5)\n- White's bishop is very active on f5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: The bishop is very strong and should be preserved. Moving it to h7 or g6 would allow Black to play ...Nf4+ winning the g4 pawn. e6 looks interesting to control more squares.\n- King moves: b5c6 looks tempting to support the d-pawn's advance, but we must consider Black's counterplay with ...g4.\n4. Main threats:\n- Black can play ...Nf4+ at some point, winning the g4 pawn\n- Black's king is close to White's passed pawn\n- Black's g-pawn is dangerous if it advances\n5. Best plan:\n- Support the d-pawn's advance while restraining Black's g-pawn\n- Keep the bishop active and controlling key squares\n- Prevent Black's knight from becoming too active\nAfter careful consideration, b5c6 seems strongest:\n- Supports d4 advance next move\n- Controls key squares\n- Prevents Black's king from approaching the d-pawn\n- If Black plays ...g4, we can respond with Bxg4\nOther moves:\n- Bishop moves mostly allow ...Nf4+ tricks\n- King moves like b5a5/b6 don't make progress\n- b5a4 would be too passive\n```\nb5c6\n```"
