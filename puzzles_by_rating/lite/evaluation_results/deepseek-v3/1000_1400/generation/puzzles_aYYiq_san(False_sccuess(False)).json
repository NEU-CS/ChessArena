When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (White has R+B vs Black's Q+B), but White has more active pieces and better coordination.\n2. Black's king is exposed on a7, while White's king is relatively safe.\n3. Black has several pawn weaknesses (c5, e4, f6) that can be targeted.\n4. White's bishop on c3 is very strong, eyeing both the black king and the f6 pawn.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c3f6 - attacking the queen and threatening mate on b8\n2. b3b7 - sacrificing the queen to expose the black king\n3. b3e6 - attacking the queen while developing threats\n4. e3f4 - challenging the e4 pawn\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c3f6 looks very strong as it attacks the queen and threatens Qb8# next move. Black's only way to defend is Qxf6, but then:\n  - After Qxf6, Rxf6 wins a pawn and maintains pressure\n  - The black king remains very exposed\n- b3b7 is tempting but after Kxb7, Rxb6+ Ka7, White doesn't have an immediate knockout blow\n- b3e6 allows Qxe6 which isn't as forcing\n- e3f4 is too slow and doesn't capitalize on White's initiative\nThe most forcing and strongest move is c3f6, which creates immediate threats against both the queen and the king. Black has no good way to defend against both threats simultaneously.\n```\nc3f6\n```"
