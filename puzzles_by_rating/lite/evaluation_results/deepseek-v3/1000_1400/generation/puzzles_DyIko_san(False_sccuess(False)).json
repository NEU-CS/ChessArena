When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has a bishop, two pawns (c5, d7) and a king\n- Black has a rook, pawn (g6, f3) and a king\n- White is up a pawn, but the position is very sharp\n2. Key features:\n- White's d7 pawn is about to promote\n- Black's rook is active on d1, controlling the d-file\n- White's bishop is very active on h4, pinning the g6 pawn\n- Black's f3 pawn is threatening to promote soon\n3. Candidate moves:\n- d7d8q (promoting to queen): This seems natural, but after ...Rd8, White must deal with the threat of ...f2\n- h4f6: Capturing the g6 pawn with check, but after ...Kxf6, Black's king becomes active\n- c5c6: Pushing the pawn, but this seems too slow given Black's threats\n- b3b4: Not immediately helpful\n4. Best move analysis:\n- After d7d8q Rd8, White must play Kc4 to stop ...f2, but then Black has ...Rd4+ winning the c5 pawn\n- h4f6+ Kxf6 is dangerous as Black's king can support the f-pawn\n- The best option seems to be h4d8! - this is a zwischenzug (in-between move) that deflects the rook from controlling d8\nAfter h4d8:\n- If Rxd8, then d7d8q promotes with check and White wins\n- If Rxh4, then d7d8q promotes and White has a winning queen vs rook endgame\n- Black has no good way to prevent promotion\nThis seems like the most forcing and winning line.\n```\nh4d8\n```"
