When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook on e8 and queen on e6, while White has rook on e1 and queen on e3.\n2. King safety: Black's king is on g8 with pawns on f7 and g7. White's king is on h1 with pawns on f2 and h2. Both kings are somewhat exposed.\n3. Pawn structure: Black has pawns on a7, b6, d5, f7, g7, h7. White has pawns on a2, b2, d4, f2, h2. Black's d5 pawn is isolated but controls important squares.\n4. Piece activity: Black's queen is very active on e6, eyeing both sides of the board. The rook on e8 is currently passive. White's queen on e3 is well placed, controlling key squares.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- e6e4: Attacking the d4 pawn and gaining space\n- e6g4: Threatening the f2 pawn and creating mating threats\n- e6f5: Centralizing the queen and increasing pressure\n- b6b5: Preparing queenside expansion\n- e8e7: Activating the rook\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e6g4 looks very strong as it threatens f2 and creates potential mating threats with Qh3+\n- The move also prevents White from playing Qg5+ which would be annoying\n- White's defenses would be stretched trying to defend against this\nThe best move is:\n```\ne6g4\n```"
