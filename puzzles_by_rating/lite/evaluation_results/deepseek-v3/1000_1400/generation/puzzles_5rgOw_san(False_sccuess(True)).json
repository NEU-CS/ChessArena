When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns\n- Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but positionally White is better\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen is on g7, attacking Black's king which is stuck in the center\n- White has a strong knight on e6, supported by the rook on d6\n- Black's king is very exposed with no castling rights\n- Black's bishop is still on c8, undeveloped\n- The only legal move is d7d6, which is forced\n3. Forced move analysis (d7d6):\n- This moves the pawn to block the queen's attack on g7\n- However, it allows White to play Qxg6, winning a pawn and maintaining pressure\n- The alternative would be to resign as the position is lost\n4. Evaluation:\n- After d7d6 Qxg6, White has a clear advantage with:\n  - Better king safety\n  - More active pieces\n  - Passed pawn potential\n- Black's position is very difficult to defend\nSince d7d6 is the only legal move, we must play it despite the unfavorable consequences. There is no better alternative.\n```\nd7d6\n```"
