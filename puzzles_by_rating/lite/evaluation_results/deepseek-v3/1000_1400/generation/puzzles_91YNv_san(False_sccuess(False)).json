When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have only kings and pawns. Black has 2 pawns (a5, h3) vs White's 2 pawns (a4, f3). Material is equal.\n2. King positions:\n- Black king is very active on d5\n- White king is on f2, defending the f3 pawn\n3. Pawn structure:\n- Black's a-pawn is blocked by White's a-pawn\n- Black's h-pawn is advanced to h3\n- White's f-pawn is on f3, restricting Black's king movement\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e6/d5d6/d5c6 - advancing the king towards White's pawns\n- h3h2 - pushing the passed h-pawn\n- d5c4 - moving king to support the a-pawn\nKey observations:\n- The h-pawn is passed and can potentially queen\n- White's king is tied to defending f3\n- Black's king is well placed to support either pawn\nBest move seems to be pushing the h-pawn immediately:\n- After h3h2, White must respond with Kf2g2 to stop the pawn\n- Then Black can bring the king closer with d5e4 or d5c4\n- This creates zugzwang where White must give way\nOther moves like king moves allow White to bring his king closer to the h-pawn. The immediate h-pawn push is most forcing.\n```\nh3h2\n```"
