When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n   - White has a knight on e5 which is well placed\n   - Black has a knight on e4 which is also strong\n   - White's light-squared bishop is very active on f4\n   - Black's king is still in the center (castled kingside but rook moved back)\n   - White has some pressure on the f-file with rook on f1\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e4f6: Trading knights, but after gxf6 White's bishop becomes very strong\n   - e4d6: Centralizing the knight, but it might get kicked by c4-c5\n   - g7f6: Developing the bishop to challenge White's strong knight\n   - c6e5: Trading knights, but this gives White the bishop pair\n   - d8d7: Moving the queen to connect rooks\n4. Best options:\n   - g7f6 looks interesting to challenge the e5 knight\n   - e4f6 is tempting but gives White too much activity\n   - d8d7 is solid but a bit passive\nAfter careful consideration, g7f6 seems most principled:\n- It challenges White's strong knight\n- Maintains control over e5\n- Keeps options open for future development\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\nThe move also prepares to potentially double rooks on the f-file later. Other moves either give White too much activity or don't address the immediate imbalance in the position.\n```\ng7f6\n```"
