When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, queen, knight, pawn vs White's rook, bishop, queen, knight, pawn)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on d6\n- White has a knight on c4 that's well placed\n- Black's e5 pawn is weak and potentially backward\n- White has pressure on the d-file with rook on d1\n- Black's king is still in the center (though castled kingside)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e7: Centralizing the queen more, but might be too passive\n- f6e4: Knight jump attacking c3 bishop, but after dxe4 dxe4 White has Qxe4\n- d5d4: Pushing the pawn to challenge White's center\n- c8e6: Developing the bishop to a more active square\n- f6g4: Knight jump with ideas of Nh6 or Nf2+\n4. Best continuation seems to be d5d4:\n- Challenges White's pawn structure immediately\n- Opens lines for Black's pieces\n- After c3xd4, Black can consider Qxd4 with active play\n- If White doesn't take, Black gains space in the center\nOther moves like f6e4 or c8e6 are playable but don't address the central tension as directly.\nHere's the move:\n```\nd5d4\n```"
