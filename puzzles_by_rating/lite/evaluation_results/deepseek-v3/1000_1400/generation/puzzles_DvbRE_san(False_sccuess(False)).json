When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a bishop pair, but White has active pieces)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong knight on e5 and bishop pair\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has pressure on the e-file and potential threats against f7\n- Black's queen on d6 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6d7: Protecting the bishop on b7 and potentially preparing to double rooks\n- f6d5: Challenging White's strong knight\n- g7g5: Trying to create counterplay on the kingside\n- a7b6: Developing the bishop to a more active square\n4. After deeper analysis:\n- d6d7 seems passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n- f6d5 is interesting but after Nxd5 exd5, White's bishop pair becomes very strong\n- g7g5 is risky as it weakens the king position\n- a7b6 seems most flexible, developing the bishop and potentially preparing ...c5 to challenge White's center\n5. The move a7b6:\n- Develops the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- Prepares ...c5 to challenge White's center\n- Maintains flexibility in the position\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or create weaknesses. Therefore, a7b6 appears to be the best choice in this position.\n```\na7b6\n```"
