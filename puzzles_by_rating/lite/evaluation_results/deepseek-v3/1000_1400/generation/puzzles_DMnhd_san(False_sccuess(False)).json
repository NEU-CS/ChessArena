When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has king + 2 pawns vs Black's king + 3 pawns. Black is up one pawn, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on b6\n- Black has a passed pawn on b7\n- White's king is very active\n- Black's king is somewhat restricted by White's pawns\n3. Candidate moves:\na) f5g6 - captures the f6 pawn, but after ...fxg6, White's king is pushed back\nb) f5f6 - advances the pawn, but allows ...g5 with counterplay\nc) f5e6 - centralizes the king and threatens to support the b-pawn\nLet's analyze each move deeper:\na) f5g6 fxg6\n   Ke5 (threatening Kd6) Kc5\n   Kxe5 Kxb6\n   Kd6 Kb5\n   e5 Kc4\n   e6 Kd3\n   e7 Ke2\n   e8=Q Kf2\n   Qxg6 - White should win, but it's complicated\nb) f5f6 g5\n   Ke6 Kc5\n   Kf5 Kxb6\n   Kxg5 Kc5\n   Kf5 Kd4\n   Kg6 Ke3\n   Kxh6 Kf4\n   Kg6 Kg4\n   h6 - White can promote but Black's king is close\nc) f5e6\n   - Immediately centralizes the king\n   - Threatens to go to d7 to support the b-pawn\n   - Cuts off Black's king from the kingside\n   - After ...Kc5, White can play Kd7 Kxb6 Ke7 and promote the e-pawn\nMove c) seems most straightforward and strongest. It gives White a clear path to promotion while keeping Black's counterplay under control.\n```\nf5e6\n```"
