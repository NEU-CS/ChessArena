When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, queen, rook and pawn vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on e5 attacking f7 and d7\n- Black's king is exposed on f8 with only a rook on h8 for protection\n- Black has pressure on c3 with their rook and knight\n- White's queen is very active on g3 with potential threats against the black king\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Knight sacrifice to open the king\n- g3g7: Direct queen attack\n- b5e8: Bishop sacrifice to expose the king\n- h1h4: Rook lift to join the attack\n4. Calculating e5f7:\nAfter e5f7 kf7, we have:\n- g3g7+ ke6\n- b5d7+! (discovered check) kd7\n- g7e7+ kc8\n- White has strong threats but black can defend with qe7\n5. Calculating g3g7:\ng7 is defended by the queen, but after g3g7 qg7, h5g6 forks queen and rook, winning material.\n6. Calculating b5e8:\nb5e8 re8, g3g7 qg7, h5g6 wins the queen, but black gets some counterplay with re1+\n7. Calculating h1h4:\nThis is more positional, preparing to double rooks or swing to the kingside, but may be too slow.\nThe most forcing and strongest line appears to be g3g7, winning the queen after h5g6. Even though the queen is defended, the pawn fork wins material decisively.\nHere's the move:\n```\ng3g7\n```"
