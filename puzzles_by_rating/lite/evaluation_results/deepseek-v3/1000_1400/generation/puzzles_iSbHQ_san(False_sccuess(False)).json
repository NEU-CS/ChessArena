When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has queen, rook, 5 pawns\n- White has queen, rook, 3 pawns (including a passed a-pawn)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed a-pawn on a6\n- Black's queen is very active on a7\n- Black's rook on d3 is well placed\n- White's queen on e1 is somewhat passive\n- Black's king is slightly exposed but not in immediate danger\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) a7e7 - attacking the white queen while keeping pressure\nb) d3d1 - pinning the white queen to the king\nc) a7b7 - protecting the b7 square against potential rook invasion\nd) g8g7 - improving king safety\n4. Analysis:\n- a7e7 looks strong as it forces the white queen to move or be exchanged\n- d3d1 is tempting but after Qxd1 Rxd1, White has Q+R vs Q+R with a passed pawn\n- a7b7 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- g8g7 is too passive\n5. Best continuation:\na7e7 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the white queen\n- Maintains control of the position\n- Keeps all pieces active\n- Doesn't allow White any counterplay\nAfter 29...Qe7, White would likely have to move their queen, allowing Black to maintain pressure.\nHere's the move:\n```\na7e7\n```"
