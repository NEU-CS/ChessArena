When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, pawn vs Black's rook, bishop, queen, pawn. Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on c6\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 but it's blockaded\n- White has a passed f-pawn that could be dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: c6e8 looks tempting to attack the rook\n- Rook moves: e1e6 could be strong to double on the e-file\n- Pawn moves: f5f6 or g3g4 to advance passed pawns\n4. Deep analysis:\n- c6e8: Attacks the rook, but after ...Rxe8 Qxe8+ Kh7, Black's queen defends\n- e1e6: Very strong - threatens Qe8+ winning the rook, and if ...Qxe6 fxe6 leaves White up material\n- f5f6: Creates a passed pawn but gives Black counterplay with ...Qh6+\n- g3g4: Advances pawn but doesn't create immediate threats\n5. Best move:\ne1e6 is crushing because:\n- It threatens Qe8+ winning the rook\n- If Black takes with Qxe6, fxe6 and White's passed pawns will decide\n- If Black doesn't take, White can double on the e-file with devastating effect\nAll other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black counterplay. e1e6 maximizes White's active piece play and creates decisive threats.\n```\ne1e6\n```"
