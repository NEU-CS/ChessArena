When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed c-pawn that could become dangerous.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on b5 is very active, pinning the c8 rook\n- Black's queen is centralized but exposed\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White has pressure on the e5 pawn\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4c6: Queen trade, but after Qxc6 Bxc6, White's passed pawn becomes stronger\n- f5d4: Centralizing the knight, but allows Bxd4 Qxd4 Nxd4 with complications\n- f8d6: Developing the bishop while protecting e5\n- c8b8: Unpinning the rook\n4. Best options seem to be:\n- f8d6: Develops the bishop, protects e5, and maintains flexibility\n- c8b8: Immediately solves the pin issue\nAfter deeper consideration, c8b8 is more precise because:\n- It removes the pin immediately\n- Prepares to potentially double rooks on the b-file\n- Keeps options open for the bishop\n- Maintains control over d8 square for possible king evacuation\nThe other moves either allow complications or don't address the immediate pin issue.\n```\nc8b8\n```"
