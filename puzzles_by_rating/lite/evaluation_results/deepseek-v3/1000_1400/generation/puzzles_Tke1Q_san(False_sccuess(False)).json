When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed on g8 with weak dark squares around it\n4. Black's queen on f6 is defending key squares but is overloaded\n5. White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\nKey observations:\n- Black's bishop on h7 is bad (blocked by its own pawns)\n- Black's rook on f8 is tied to defending f7\n- White has potential for a kingside attack\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e3h6 - immediate threat to win the queen (Qg6 Qxh6 Qxf8+)\n2. g4g6 - attacking the queen and threatening Qxg7#\n3. c1f1 - doubling rooks on the f-file\n4. d5d6 - advancing the passed pawn\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- e3h6 looks very strong: after 1...Qxh6 2.Qxf8+ Kh7 3.Qxf7 White wins material\n- If 1...gxh6 then 2.Qg6+ Kh8 3.Qxh6+ Kg8 4.Qg6+ Kh8 5.Rf1 and mate is coming\n- Other moves don't create such immediate threats\nBlack's best try would be 1...Qe7 after e3h6, but White still maintains a strong attack with moves like Qg6 or Rf1.\nTherefore, the most forcing and strongest move is:\n```\ne3h6\n```"
