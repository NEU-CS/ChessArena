When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: White king is exposed on f2, Black king is somewhat exposed on h8\n3. Threats: Black's queen on e4 is attacking White's rook on d3 and knight on d5\n4. Black's knight on g4 is threatening mate in 1 with Qxf2#\n5. White's queen on a7 is very active and controlling important squares\nCandidate moves:\n1. f2g3 - blocks the mate threat but leaves the king very exposed\n2. f2g1 - gets the king to relative safety but allows Qxf2+ next move\nAfter f2g1, Black can play Qxf2+ and then:\n- If Kg2, then Qxg3+ winning material\n- If Kh1, then Qf1+ with mate to follow\nAfter f2g3, it blocks the immediate mate threat but:\n- Black can play Qxd5 winning the knight\n- Or Nxh2 with complications\nThe best practical chance seems to be f2g3, as after Qxd5 we have Qxd7 with some counterplay. f2g1 leads to immediate material loss or mate.\n```\nf2g3\n```"
