When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: rook, bishop, pawn (potentially more, but FEN shows limited pieces)\n- White has: queen, 2 knights, rook, pawns\n- Black is down material (queen vs. rook+bishop)\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on e7 attacking f5 and g6\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White's queen on c5 is very active\n- Black's rook on e8 is under attack from White's knight\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White's knight on e7 is attacking Black's rook on e8\n- White's queen can potentially create mating threats\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8e7 - trading rooks but leaving Black's position very weak\n- e8h8 - moving the rook to safety but passive\n- f6e7 - counterattacking the knight with the queen\n- f6g6 - moving queen to defend g7\n- f7e6 - moving the king away from danger\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f6e7 seems tempting but after Nxe7 Rxe7, White's queen can create threats\n- e8h8 is too passive\n- The best practical chance is f6g6, defending the g7 pawn and keeping some coordination\nThe move f6g6:\n- Defends g7 pawn\n- Keeps queen active\n- Prevents immediate disasters\n- Maintains some counterplay possibilities\nHere's the move:\n```\nf6g6\n```"
