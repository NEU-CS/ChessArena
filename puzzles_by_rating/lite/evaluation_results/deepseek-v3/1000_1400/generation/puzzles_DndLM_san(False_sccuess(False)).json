When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook on d4 and a pawn on f7\n3. White has rooks on e6 and h6, with passed pawns on g5 and f4\n4. Black's pawn structure is a7, b5\n5. White's king is at b1\nImmediate threats:\n- White's rook on h6 is attacking Black's king\n- White could potentially play Rh7+ next move if not addressed\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g7g8 - moves king away from attack but leaves it exposed\n2. g7f8 - similar to above but slightly more active\n3. f7f6 - blocks the rook's attack but weakens pawn structure\n4. d4d8 - counterattack by threatening to pin White's rook\n5. d4f4 - captures the passed pawn but leaves rook vulnerable\nAfter evaluating:\n- g7g8 seems too passive and allows White to continue attacking\n- f7f6 blocks the rook but weakens the pawn structure unnecessarily\n- d4d8 is interesting as it threatens to pin the rook on e6 after Rd8\n- d4f4 captures the passed pawn but after gxf4, Black's position remains difficult\nThe best move appears to be d4d8, creating counterplay by threatening to pin the rook on e6. After 31...Rd8, possible continuation could be 32. Rh7+ Kf8 33. Rf7+ Ke8, where Black maintains some activity.\nThis move maintains the most active possibilities for Black while addressing the immediate threats.\n```\nd4d8\n```"
