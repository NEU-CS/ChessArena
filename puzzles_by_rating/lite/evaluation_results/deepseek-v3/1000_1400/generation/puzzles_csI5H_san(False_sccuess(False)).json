When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White has doubled rooks on the g-file, eyeing the g7 bishop\n- Black's queen is very active on f5\n- White's knight on b5 is well placed\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on b1\n3. Candidate moves:\na) b1a2 - King moves to a2, getting away from potential checks\nb) e3e4 - Queen moves forward, attacking black's queen\nc) e3d3 - Queen moves sideways, defending the b3 knight\nLet me evaluate each:\na) b1a2:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- But doesn't improve our position actively\n- Black could play Qf5xf3 next move\nb) e3e4:\n- Attacks the black queen\n- Black would likely play Qf5xe4\n- Then we could play Nxe4, but after ...Bxe4 our queen is gone\n- Doesn't seem advantageous\nc) e3d3:\n- Defends the knight on b3\n- Maintains queen's central position\n- Prevents any tactics involving the b3 knight\n- Keeps options open for future moves\nAfter careful consideration, e3d3 seems the most solid move. It maintains our position's stability while preventing any potential tactics from Black. The other moves either don't improve our position or could lead to unfavorable exchanges.\n```\ne3d3\n```"
