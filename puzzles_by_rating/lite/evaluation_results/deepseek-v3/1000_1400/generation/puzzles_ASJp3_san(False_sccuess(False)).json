When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully.\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a queen on g4 and rook on b7, while Black has a queen on d3 and rook on f8.\n2. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover.\n3. White's king is relatively safe on g1.\n4. Material is roughly equal (Q+R vs Q+R), but White has more active pieces.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qg4-c8: Threatening mate on c8, but Black can defend with Qd3-d8\n2. Qg4-g7: Direct attack on the king, but Black can take with rook (f8xg7)\n3. Rb7-f7: Pinning the f-pawn to the king, but Black can play Qd3-g6 defending\n4. Rb7-b8: Promoting threat, but Black can simply take with rook (f8xb8)\nAfter careful consideration, the most forcing and dangerous move is Qg4-g7, sacrificing the queen but leading to a forced mate:\n1. Qg4-g7 f8xg7 (forced)\n2. Rb7-b8+ (discovered check) kg8-h7\n3. Rb8-h8# (mate)\nEven if Black tries other defenses after Qg7, White maintains a winning advantage. For example:\n- If Black doesn't take the queen with 1...Qd3-g6, then 2. Qxg6 hxg6 3. Rb8+ wins the rook\n- Or if 1...Qd3-d8, then 2. Qxf8+! Qxf8 3. Rb8 wins the queen\nThe immediate queen sacrifice is the most decisive path to victory.\n```\ng4g7\n```"
