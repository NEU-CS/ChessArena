When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a passed d-pawn but it's currently blockaded.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d3 is very active\n- Black's queen on g6 is eyeing the h5-e8 diagonal\n- Black's rook on d8 is controlling the d-file\n- White has rooks on c1 and f1 with potential to double on the f-file\n- Black has a kingside pawn majority but it's not yet dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- Black has no immediate threats\n- White can consider several active options\n4. Candidate moves:\na) d3a6 - Queen takes pawn with check, but after ...Qxa6 we lose coordination\nb) d3f5 - Attacking the queen, but after ...Qxf5 exf5 we get a rook ending that might be equal\nc) c1c8 - Rook invasion, but after ...Rxc8 Qxc8+ Kg7 it's unclear\nd) e5e6 - Pushing the pawn to create threats against the king\ne) f1f4 - Blockading the f-pawn and preparing to double rooks\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e5e6 looks very promising as it opens lines towards Black's king and creates threats\n- After e5e6, Black has to deal with the passed pawn and potential discovered attacks\n- If Black takes exe6, we can consider Qxe6+ with strong pressure\n- If Black ignores it, we can push e6e7 creating more threats\nThis seems like the most forcing and promising continuation. The pawn push creates immediate problems for Black to solve while maintaining our piece activity.\n```\ne5e6\n```"
