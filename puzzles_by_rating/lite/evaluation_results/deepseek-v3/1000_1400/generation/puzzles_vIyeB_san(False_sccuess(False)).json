When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (rook, bishop, knight, pawns). White has doubled rooks on the h-file which could be useful.\n2. King safety: White's king is safely castled while Black's king is still in the center, which is a potential weakness.\n3. Piece activity:\n   - White's bishop on c4 is very active, eyeing the f7 pawn and potentially the e6 square\n   - Black's bishop on b4 is pinning the c3 knight to the king\n   - Black's bishop on e6 is somewhat passive\n4. Pawn structure:\n   - White has a passed pawn on e5 which could be advanced\n   - White has a kingside pawn majority (g4, h3 vs f7, h6)\nCandidate moves to consider:\na) c4e6 - Bishop takes bishop, removing a defender of f7 and opening the d-file\nb) c3d5 - Knight jump, attacking the bishop on b4 and potentially freeing the c-file\nc) h1h2 - Rook lift, preparing to double on the h-file or swing to the center\nd) g4g5 - Pawn push, opening lines against Black's king\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c4e6 seems most promising as it:\n  * Removes a defender of f7\n  * Opens the d-file for White's rooks\n  * Creates potential threats against Black's king\n  * After ...fxe6, White can consider moves like Nh4 or Rdf1 with strong pressure\nThe other options:\n- c3d5 allows ...Bxc3 when White's pawn structure would be compromised\n- h1h2 is too slow\n- g4g5 is premature as Black can respond with ...h5\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc4e6\n```"
