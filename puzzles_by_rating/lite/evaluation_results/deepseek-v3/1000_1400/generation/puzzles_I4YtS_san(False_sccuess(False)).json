When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black is up a bishop but White has a passed e-pawn.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h4 is very active\n- Black's queen on h6 is defending the rook on d8\n- White's e5 pawn is passed and could be dangerous\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h7\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4d8 (queen trade) - but after Qxd8 Rxd8, Black's rook is active\n- h4h6 - forcing queen trade, but again leads to rook endgame\n- e1e4 - centralizing the rook, but not immediately threatening\n- e5e6 - advancing the passed pawn, but can be blocked by ...f6\n- h4f6 - attacking the queen while keeping ours active\n4. Best move seems to be h4f6:\n- Attacks the black queen\n- Maintains our active queen\n- If Qxf6, then exf6 opens the e-file for our rook\n- If Q moves away, we can consider advancing e-pawn or other ideas\nThis maintains maximum activity and pressure while not allowing Black to simplify into a favorable endgame.\n```\nh4f6\n```"
