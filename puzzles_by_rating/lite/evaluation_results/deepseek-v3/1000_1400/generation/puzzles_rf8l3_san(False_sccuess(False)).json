When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (rook + minor pieces vs rook + queen is often balanced).\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h2 with limited pawn cover. Black's king is safer behind pawns.\n3. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on e4 attacking f6 and g5 squares\n- Black's queen is very active on f7\n- Black has a passed e3 pawn that could be dangerous\n- White's rooks are not optimally placed yet\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f6: Knight fork attacking queen and rook\n- f4h6: Bishop checks king, potentially forcing it to h8\n- h1g1: Rook lift to potentially double on g-file\n- d2e3: Capturing the dangerous passed pawn\nLet me evaluate e4f6 first:\n- After e4f6, if Qxf6 then Bxf6 Rxf6 and we have rook vs rook + bishop ending which should be drawn\n- But Black can play Qe7 instead, keeping queens on the board\nf4h6 looks interesting:\n- f4h6+ Kh8 (forced)\n- Then e4f6 attacks queen and rook\n- Q moves away, then we can capture rook on g8\nBut Black might have Qxh6 after e4f6\nd2e3 seems solid:\n- Removes the dangerous passed pawn\n- Opens d-file for rooks\n- But Qxe3 would be strong for Black\nAfter careful consideration, e4f6 seems the most forcing move, creating immediate threats. Even if Black avoids the queen trade, we gain activity.\n```\ne4f6\n```"
