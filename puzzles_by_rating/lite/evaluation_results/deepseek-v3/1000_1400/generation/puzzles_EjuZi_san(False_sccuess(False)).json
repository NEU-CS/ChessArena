When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's queen is very dangerous near our king.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on f2 is threatening mate in 1 (Qf1#)\n- Our bishop on g2 is pinned to the king by Black's queen\n- Black's knight on e2 is also very dangerous\n- Our rook on b6 is our most active piece\n3. Immediate threats:\nWe must address the mate threat Qf1# first and foremost. Let's examine possible defenses:\na) Moving the rook doesn't help - all rook moves leave Qf1# possible\nb) Knight moves:\n- e3f5 blocks the bishop's defense of f1, allowing Qf1#\n- e3d5 doesn't help\n- e3g4 blocks the bishop but still allows Qf1#\nc) Bishop moves:\n- g2d5 or g2e4 unpins but still allows Qf1#\nd) Queen moves:\n- d1e2 seems interesting as it blocks the knight's attack and defends f1\ne) Other moves:\n- c1d2 might help by reinforcing e2\nAfter careful consideration, d1e2 seems best as it:\n1. Blocks the knight's attack on g1\n2. Defends against Qf1#\n3. Attacks Black's knight on e2\nThe move also sets up potential discovered attacks if Black takes our queen.\nOther options either don't stop mate or lose material. For example, c1d2 allows Qf1+ followed by Nxd1.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd1e2\n```"
