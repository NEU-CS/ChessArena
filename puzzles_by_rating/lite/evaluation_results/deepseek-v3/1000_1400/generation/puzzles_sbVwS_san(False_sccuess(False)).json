When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully. Here's my thought process:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a bishop pair but White has better coordination)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong pawn on e5 cramping Black's position\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n- White has pressure on the b-file with the rook on b1\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's knight on f3 is well-placed, controlling key squares\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6c8: Developing the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- e6d7: Protecting the c5 bishop and potentially preparing ...Bc6\n- b6c7: Moving the queen to a safer square while maintaining pressure\n- d5d4: Trying to open the position for the bishops\n- g6g5: Gaining space on the kingside\n4. Evaluating the best move:\n- e6c8 looks interesting as it develops the bishop to a more active diagonal (a6-f1) and potentially prepares to double rooks on the e-file\n- b6c7 is safe but a bit passive\n- d5d4 could be premature as it opens the position when White is better developed\n- g6g5 weakens the kingside and gives White targets\n5. Potential threats:\n- White might play Bb2 next, increasing pressure on the long diagonal\n- White could consider doubling rooks on the b-file\n- The e5 pawn is cramping Black's position\nAfter careful consideration, e6c8 seems the most principled move, activating the bishop and preparing potential rook doubling. It also keeps options open for both kingside and queenside play.\nHere's the move:\n```\ne6c8\n```"
