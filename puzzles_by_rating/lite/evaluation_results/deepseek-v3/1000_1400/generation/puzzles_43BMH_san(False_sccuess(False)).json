When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has queen vs rook + bishop for White, but White has extra pawns to compensate). \n2. King safety: White's king is castled but has some exposure on the f-file. Black's king is still in the center which is dangerous.\n3. Key features:\n   - Black's queen is very active on d4\n   - White has a bishop pair and control of the d-file\n   - Black's f6 knight is pinned to the king by White's bishop on d3\n   - Black's bishop on b4 is active but could be vulnerable\n4. Immediate threats:\n   - White could play Qxd4 next move, winning the queen due to the pin\n   - White could also play moves like Bxb4 or Nxb4\nThe most critical issue is the pin on the f6 knight and the threat to the queen. We need to:\n- Either protect the queen\n- Or move it to a safe square where it can't be captured with advantage\nLooking at queen moves:\n- d4d5 looks interesting, attacking the bishop on d3\n- d4e5 also looks reasonable, keeping pressure\n- d4d8 would get the queen to safety but seems passive\nLooking at other pieces:\n- We should consider castling (e8g8) to get the king to safety\n- b4c3 looks tempting to fork the knight and bishop, but after Bxc3 Qxc3, White has Qxd3 winning material\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be castling to get the king to safety while also connecting the rooks. This solves our immediate king safety issues and prepares to bring the h8 rook into play.\nThe move e8g8 addresses the most pressing concerns while maintaining our active queen position. Other queen moves either leave the queen vulnerable or don't solve the king safety issue.\n```\ne8g8\n```"
