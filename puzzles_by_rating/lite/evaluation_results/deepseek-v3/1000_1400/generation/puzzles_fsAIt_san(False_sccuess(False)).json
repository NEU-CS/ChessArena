When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has bishop and knight vs White's two bishops, but otherwise balanced)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong knight on e5 and bishop pair\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with the rook on f8\n- White has pressure along the h3-c8 diagonal and h-file\n- Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on b6\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g8h8: Moves the king to safety but doesn't address other issues\n- f8f7: Defends the e7 queen but leaves the f-file open\n- e7f7: Queen moves to defend f7 but blocks the rook\n- e7e6: Queen moves to e6 but could be vulnerable to discovered attacks\n- b7d5: The most active move, trading off White's strong bishop\n4. Best move considerations:\n- b7d5 is the most principled move, trading a passive bishop for White's active one\n- After Bxd5, Black can recapture with c6xd5, opening the c-file for the rook\n- This reduces White's attacking potential while activating Black's pieces\n- Other moves either don't improve Black's position or create new weaknesses\n5. Potential lines:\n- After b7d5 Bxd5 c6xd5, White might play Qh3-h5 with some pressure, but Black can defend with ...Qe7-f7 if needed\n- The position remains balanced but Black's pieces become more active\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb7d5\n```"
