When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook on d8 and bishop on d5\n3. White's king is somewhat exposed on h2\n4. Black has pawn weaknesses on b5 and c4\n5. White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qf8 - threatening mate, but Black can defend with Rxf8\n2. Qe7 - attacking the rook and bishop, but Black has Qxe7\n3. Qd6 - attacking the bishop, but after Bxd6, dxd6 we lose our strong queen\n4. Bh6 - threatening mate, but gxh6 is possible\n5. Bg5 - threatening mate, but Black can play f6\n6. Qb6 - attacking the b5 pawn and threatening to penetrate\nLooking deeper:\n- Qf8 Rxf8 is bad as we lose our queen\n- Qe7 Qxe7 is also bad\n- Qb6 looks interesting as it attacks b5 and threatens Qd8+\n- Bh6 gxh6 Qg1+ Kh8 Qxh6+ Kg8 Qg5+ Kh8 Qh6+ would be perpetual check, but we might want more\n- Bg5 f6 Bxf6 Rxf6 Qxf6 Qf7 holds for Black\nThe most promising seems Qb6:\n- After Qb6, if Black defends b5 with a6, we have Qd8+ Rxd8 Rxd8+ Qf8 Rxf8+ Kxf8 and we win material\n- If Black plays Qxb6, then axb6 and we have a strong passed pawn on d4\n- Black's best might be Qe6, but then Qxe6 fxe6 and we have a winning endgame\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous line.\n```\nc5b6\n```"
