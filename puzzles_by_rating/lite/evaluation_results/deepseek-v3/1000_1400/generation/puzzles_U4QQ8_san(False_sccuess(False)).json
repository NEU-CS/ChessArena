When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (no pieces captured yet). White has a slight space advantage and more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on e5 and bishop on b4 putting pressure on black's position\n- Black's pawn structure is solid but the d6 pawn is backward and potentially weak\n- Black's king is safely castled but the f8 rook is not connected yet\n- White has pressure along the d-file and potential to increase it\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6e4: Challenging the strong e5 knight immediately\n- f6d7: Retreating the knight to defend d6 pawn\n- c8d7: Developing the bishop while defending d6\n- b8d7: Developing the knight while defending d6\n4. Evaluating f6e4:\nAfter f6e4 dxe4 dxe4, white can play Qxd8 Rxd8 Bxe4 with a slight edge due to bishop pair and better structure.\n5. Evaluating c8d7:\nThis develops the bishop but leaves the d6 pawn still vulnerable to future pressure.\n6. Evaluating b8d7:\nThis seems more flexible - it develops the knight, defends d6, and keeps options open for the bishop. After b8d7, possible continuations could be c8b7 or f8e8 next.\n7. The move f6d7 seems too passive, just retreating without improving other pieces.\nAfter considering all options, b8d7 seems the most principled move:\n- Develops a piece\n- Defends the weak d6 pawn\n- Maintains flexibility for other pieces\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\nHere's the move:\n```\nb8d7\n```"
