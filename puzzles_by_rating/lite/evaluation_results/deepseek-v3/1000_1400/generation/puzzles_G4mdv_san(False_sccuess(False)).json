When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, B, R, 3 pawns\n- Black has: R, B, Q, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop pair)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on g1\n- Black king is vulnerable on e7 with White's queen and bishop eyeing it\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White's queen on h8 is very active\n- White's bishop on g6 is pinning the f7 pawn to the king\n- Black's queen is somewhat passive on f6\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7c8: Trading rooks but leaves Black's king more exposed\n- f6g5: Moving queen to a more active square\n- f6f7: Protecting the king but blocks the bishop\n- b6b5: Pushing the pawn but doesn't address immediate concerns\n5. Best move seems to be f6g5:\n- Gets the queen to a more active diagonal\n- Prepares potential ...Qg3+ in some lines\n- Maintains pressure on the g6 bishop\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\nAfter f6g5, if White plays Qh8xe8, Black can respond with Bc7xe8, maintaining material equality while activating the bishop.\nHere's the move:\n```\nf6g5\n```"
