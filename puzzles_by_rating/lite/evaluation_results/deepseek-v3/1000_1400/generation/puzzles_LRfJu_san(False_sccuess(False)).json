When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, rook, bishop, pawns (b5, b7, d6, e5, g6)\n- White has: king, rook, bishop, pawns (a2, b2, c2, d5, e4)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces (rook on c8 is very strong)\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on c8 is pinning Black's bishop to the king\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's pawn on d5 is passed and potentially dangerous\n- Black's bishop on f3 is active but could be vulnerable\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Moving the king away from potential checks\n- f3e4: Counterattacking the e4 pawn\n- g7f7: Moving the rook to defend the bishop\n- b5b4: Advancing the pawn to create counterplay\n4. Analysis of best options:\n- g8h8 seems passive but safe\n- f3e4 looks tempting but after dxe4, White's passed d-pawn becomes more dangerous\n- g7f7 defends the bishop but doesn't solve the pin issue\n- b5b4 creates some counterplay on the queenside\n5. Best choice:\nb5b4 seems most principled, creating counterplay and opening lines for Black's pieces. It also prevents White from playing a future a2-a4 to undermine the pawn structure. The pawn push challenges White to find accurate defensive moves while Black maintains active possibilities.\nAfter b5b4, if White takes (cxb4), Black can recapture with the a-pawn (a7xb4) and gain queenside space. If White doesn't take, Black can consider advancing further or activating the rook via the b-file.\n```\nb5b4\n```"
