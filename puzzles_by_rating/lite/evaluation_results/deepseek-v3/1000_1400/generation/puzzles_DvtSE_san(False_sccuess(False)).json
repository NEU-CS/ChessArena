King positions:\n- White king is at e4, very active\n- Black king is at b6, somewhat restricted\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White has connected passed pawns on a6 and c6\n- Black has a passed e-pawn and connected f/g pawns\n- White's b5 pawn is restraining Black's a-pawn\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f5: King moves towards Black's pawns, but allows ...e4\n- e4e5: King blocks Black's e-pawn, but allows ...f3\n- c6c7: Advances passed pawn, but Black can play ...Kxc7\n- a6a7: Advances passed pawn, but Black can play ...Kxa7\n5. Key observations:\n- White's connected passed pawns are very strong\n- Black's king is tied to stopping them\n- White's king is more active than Black's\nBest move is c6c7:\n- Forces Black's king to take: ...Kxc7\n- Then a6a7 and the a-pawn will queen\n- Black cannot stop both passed pawns\n- Even if Black pushes his pawns, White's king can stop them while the a-pawn queens\nOther moves either don't make progress or allow Black counterplay. For example:\n- e4f5 allows ...e4 and Black's pawns become dangerous\n- e4e5 allows ...f3 creating passed pawns\n- a6a7 first allows ...Kxa7 and then c6c7 is met with ...Kb6\n```\nc6c7\n```"

Key features:\n- White has connected passed pawns on a6 and b5\n- Black has a passed e-pawn and connected f/g-pawns\n- Black's king is slightly more active than White's\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e4f5: Attacks black's g4 pawn but leaves e5 pawn free\n- e4e5: Blocks black's e-pawn but doesn't make progress\n- e4d5: Centralizes king but allows black's pawns to advance\n- e4d3: Retreats king, not helpful\n- a6a7: Advances passed pawn but black can respond with Kb7\n- b5b6: Creates a protected passed pawn\n4. Best move analysis:\n- b5b6 is strong because:\n  * Creates a protected passed pawn on b6\n  * Prepares to advance the a-pawn with support\n  * Black can't stop both pawns (if Kb7 then a7, if Kc6 then b7)\n  * Even if black pushes pawns, white's connected passed pawns are more dangerous\n5. Other moves:\n- a6a7 immediately allows Kb7 stopping the pawn\n- King moves don't make progress with the pawns\n- Black's pawns aren't immediately threatening\nThe best move is to create a protected passed pawn with b5b6, which will be decisive in the long run.\n```\nb5b6\n```"
