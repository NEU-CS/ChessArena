When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a passed pawn on d7 that is very dangerous and close to promotion.\n3. Black's king is on g5, white's king is on h2.\n4. Black has pawns on g7 and h6, white has a pawn on g4.\nThe immediate threat is white's d7 pawn advancing to d8=Q. Black must address this first.\nLet's evaluate candidate moves:\n1) e6f8 - knight moves to block the pawn's path. But after d7d8Q, Nxd8, Rxd8 and white has a queen vs rook endgame which is winning.\n2) e6d8 - knight captures the pawn immediately. But after Nxd8, Rxd8 and again queen vs rook.\n3) d3d7 - rook captures the pawn. This seems best as it eliminates the immediate threat and keeps material balanced.\nOther moves like king moves or pawn moves don't address the passed pawn threat.\nAfter d3d7:\n- If white recaptures with Nxd7, then Nxd7 and we have knight vs knight endgame which should be drawn.\n- If white recaptures with Rxd7, then Nxd7 and we have knight vs rook which is worse but still better than losing to the pawn promotion.\nTherefore, d3d7 is the best move to eliminate the dangerous passed pawn immediately.\n```\nd3d7\n```"
