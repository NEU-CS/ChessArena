When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, queen, bishop, knight vs White's rook, queen, bishop, pawn). However, White has a passed pawn on d5 which could become dangerous.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8 with White's rook on f1 pointing at it. White's king is safer on g1.\n3. Piece activity: White's queen on b3 is very active, eyeing both f7 and b7. Black's queen on c7 is somewhat restricted.\n4. Threats: White has potential threats like Qxf7+ or advancing the d-pawn. Black needs to address these while improving his own position.\nCandidate moves to consider:\na) Rook moves (a8f8/a8e8): Bringing the rook to the open file or connecting rooks makes sense. a8f8 seems better to defend f7.\nb) Queen moves: c7d7 looks interesting, defending the bishop and potentially preparing ...Qd6 to challenge White's queen.\nc) Bishop moves: e6d7 would defend the queen but block the d-file.\nAfter careful consideration:\n- a8f8 is solid, defending f7 and connecting rooks\n- c7d7 is more active, preparing to challenge White's queen\n- e6d5 would trade bishops but leave the e-file open\nThe best move appears to be c7d7, as it:\n1. Defends the bishop on e6\n2. Prepares ...Qd6 to challenge White's strong queen\n3. Keeps options open for the rook\n4. Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n```\nc7d7\n```"
