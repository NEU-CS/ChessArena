When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's knight on h5 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n4. Black's dark-squared bishop is very strong on g6\n5. White's queen is centralized but could be vulnerable to ...Nf6 ideas\nKey considerations:\n- The e4 pawn is potentially weak if not supported\n- Black has pressure along the a8-h1 diagonal\n- White's king is relatively safe but could be exposed if pieces are exchanged\nCandidate moves worth considering:\n1. e3c5 - Queen to c5, attacking the c5 pawn and eyeing the kingside\n2. f4f5 - Pushing the pawn to challenge Black's strong bishop\n3. c3d5 - Knight jump to central outpost\n4. g2g4 - Trying to trap the h5 knight\nAfter careful evaluation:\n- f4f5 seems most promising as it challenges Black's strong bishop and gains space\n- If Black takes exf5, White can recapture with e4xf5, opening the e-file for the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, White can continue with f5xg6, eliminating the strong bishop\n- This also limits Black's counterplay by restricting the g6 bishop\nOther options:\n- e3c5 allows Black to play ...b6 with tempo\n- c3d5 can be met with ...Nf6 challenging the knight\n- g2g4 is too committal and weakens the kingside\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf4f5\n```"
