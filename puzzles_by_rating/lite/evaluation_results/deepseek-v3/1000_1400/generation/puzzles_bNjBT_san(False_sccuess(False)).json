Key features:\n- Black king is on e5, White king on h5\n- Black has a passed pawn on f6\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- White rook is very active on d7\n- Black rook is on d4, controlling the d-file\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White's d-pawn is advanced and may promote soon\n- White rook can potentially check from d5 or d6\n- Black's f-pawn is also a passed pawn but further back\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4d5 - trades rooks but leaves White's d-pawn very strong\n- e5f5 - king moves toward White's pawns\n- f6f5 - advances the pawn but may be premature\n- d4h4 - checks the White king\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d4d5 seems forced to stop the d-pawn from promoting\n- After d4d5, Rxd5, Kxd5, White's king can stop the f-pawn while the h-pawn is too far\n- e5f5 allows Rd5+ winning the f-pawn\n- f6f5 allows Rd6 pinning the pawn\n- d4h4+ Kh5 Rh4+ Kg5 and White can push the d-pawn\nThe best move is to trade rooks immediately to stop the d-pawn's advance, even though it leads to a lost pawn endgame. The alternatives are worse.\n```\nd4d5\n```"

Current material: Black has only a king and pawn, White has king and rook\n3. The position is:\n   - Black king on e5\n   - Black pawn on f6\n   - White king on h5\n   - White rook on d5\n   - White pawn on h4\nKey observations:\n- White's rook is attacking the d5 square\n- Black's pawn is blocked by White's rook\n- White's h-pawn is far advanced but not yet threatening to promote\n- Black's king has limited safe squares\nLet's evaluate each legal move:\n1. e5e6 (king moves forward):\n   - White can play Rd6+ next move, forcing the king back\n   - Then White can push h5, bringing king closer\n   - Not ideal as it doesn't make progress\n2. e5d5 (king takes rook):\n   - This would be Kxd5\n   - But then White plays h5, and the pawn will promote\n   - Black can't stop it: Kd6 h6 Ke7 h7 Kf7 h8=Q\n   - White queens first and wins easily\n3. e5f4 (king moves toward White's pawn):\n   - Best practical chance\n   - Threatens to approach the h-pawn\n   - White would likely play Rd4+ next, but we have f5 available\n   - Creates counterplay against the h-pawn\n4. e5e4 (king moves back):\n   - White can play Rd6, cutting off the king\n   - Then push h5-h6-h7 etc.\n   - Black can't stop the pawn\nThe best move is e5f4, as it:\n- Creates counterplay against White's pawn\n- Avoids immediate checks\n- Maintains some activity for the black king\n```\ne5f4\n```"
