When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (no pieces captured yet)\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (not castled yet), Black's king is also uncastled\n3. Piece activity: White's bishops are very active (Bb5 and Bf4), Black's pieces are somewhat cramped\n4. Key observations:\n   - White has a strong bishop pair\n   - Black's queen on d7 is awkwardly placed\n   - Black's pawn on d5 is potentially weak\n   - White has the option to castle either side\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b5c6 - Capturing the knight with the bishop, but after bxc6, Black can recapture with dxc6 and open the b-file\n2. f4c7 - Forking queen and rook, but Black can play Qxc7\n3. e1g1 - Castling kingside to improve king safety\n4. f3d5 - Challenging the center pawn, but after exd5, Black can recapture with exd5\n5. d2e4 - Centralizing the knight with tempo on the queen\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Castling (e1g1) is solid but doesn't immediately press the advantage\n- f4c7 looks tempting but after Qxc7 Bxc7, we lose the bishop pair\n- b5c6 is interesting as it disrupts Black's pawn structure\n- f3d5 is also interesting as it challenges the center\nThe best move appears to be b5c6, as it:\n1. Captures a knight\n2. Forces Black to recapture with the pawn (bxc6), damaging their pawn structure\n3. Opens the b-file for potential rook activity\n4. Maintains all of White's positional advantages\n```\nb5c6\n```"
