When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop pair (Bishops on g7 and e4)\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n- White's rook on f1 is very active, eyeing the f-file\n- Black's queen on d8 is somewhat passive\n- Black has doubled rooks on the a-file, but they're not very threatening\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qh5, targeting the weak h7 square\n- The bishop on g7 is pinning the f8 rook to the king\n- White could play Rf7 at some point, attacking the e7 bishop\n4. Available moves:\n- h8g8: Moves the king away from the pin but leaves it on an open file\n- h8g7: Captures the bishop but walks into a discovered attack from the e4 bishop\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h8g7 seems too dangerous due to the discovered attack after Bxg7\n- h8g8 is the safer option, though the king remains exposed\nThe best practical choice is to move the king to g8, avoiding immediate tactics while keeping the material balance.\n```\nh8g8\n```"
