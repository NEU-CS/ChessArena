When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Pawn structure:\n- White has pawns on a3, b2, c3, e4, f3, g2, h3\n- Black has pawns on a6, b5, c5, e6, g5, h7\n- White's pawns are generally well placed, controlling key squares\n- Black's pawns are more advanced but potentially vulnerable\n3. King safety:\n- Both kings are somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n- White's king is on f3, which is a decent central post\n- Black's king is on e6, also centralized\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4e5: This challenges Black's central pawn and opens the position. However, after ...fxe5, Black gets a passed pawn.\n- f3f4: This gains space but weakens the e4 pawn and allows ...gxf4.\n- c3c4: This challenges Black's queenside pawns and could create weaknesses.\n- g2g3: This solidifies the kingside but is somewhat passive.\n- e3d3: This centralizes the king more and prepares to support the e4 pawn.\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e4e5 is too committal and gives Black counterplay\n- f3f4 weakens our structure\n- c3c4 is interesting but might not achieve much after ...bxc4\n- e3d3 seems most flexible, improving the king's position while maintaining all options\nThe best move appears to be centralizing the king while keeping all pawn options open. This maintains flexibility and doesn't create any weaknesses.\n```\ne3d3\n```"
