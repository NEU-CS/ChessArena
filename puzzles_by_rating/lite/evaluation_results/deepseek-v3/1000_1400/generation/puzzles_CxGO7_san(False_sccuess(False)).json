When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king, queen, rook, knight, bishop, 3 pawns\n- White has: queen, rook, 4 pawns\nBlack is up a minor piece (bishop) but White has some compensation with active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e6, eyeing the g8 square\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7\n- Black's rook on h5 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Both sides have passed pawns (White's d4, Black's a4)\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qg8+ or Rc7+\n- Black needs to be careful about king safety while maintaining the material advantage\n4. Candidate moves:\n- King moves: g7h7 looks safest, getting away from potential checks\n- Knight moves: c6e5 looks interesting, attacking the queen while developing\n- Rook moves: h5h6 could be useful to defend g6 pawn\n- Bishop moves: b6d4 looks tempting to trade off White's strong d4 pawn\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g7h7 is too passive and allows White to consolidate\n- c6e5 Qxe5 dxe5 gives White connected passed pawns\n- b6d4 seems best, trading off White's strong central pawn while maintaining material advantage\nThe move b6d4:\n- Removes White's strong d4 pawn\n- Opens the b-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains all of Black's material advantages\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\nOther options either allow White counterplay or don't improve Black's position as much. Therefore, the best move is:\n```\nb6d4\n```"
