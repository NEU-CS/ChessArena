Key features:\n- White's queen and rook are very active on the d-file\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has a rook on f3 attacking f2\n- White's knight on e6 is very strong\n3. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is Rxf2, but this can be met with Qxf3\n- White has several strong candidate moves to consider:\nCandidate moves to analyze:\na) e6f8 - knight fork attacking queen and rook\nb) d5d8 - queen sacrifice leading to mate\nc) d5f3 - trading queens while removing the attacking rook\nd) e6g7 - knight sacrifice to expose the king\nLet me analyze these in detail:\na) e6f8:\nAfter 1...Qxf8 2.Qxf8+ Rxf8 3.Rxf8# - immediate mate!\nb) d5d8:\nThis looks tempting as 1...Rxd8 2.Rxd8+ Qf8 3.Rxf8# is mate\nBut Black can play 1...Qxd8 instead, though after 2.Rxd8 Rxf1+ 3.Kh2 we're up material\nc) d5f3:\n1.Qxf3 Qxf3 2.Rxf3 - this simplifies but may not be best\nd) e6g7:\n1...Kxg7 2.Qg5+ Kh8 3.Qh6 with strong attack\nThe most forcing and decisive move is e6f8, leading to immediate mate after Qxf8. Even if Black tries to avoid with Qb7, we have Qd8+ winning the rook.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne6f8\n```"

Material count:\n- White has: King, Rook (d1), Rook (f1), Queen (d5), Knight (f8), 3 pawns\n- Black has: King (h8), Queen (b8), Bishop (g6), Rook (h3), 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs queen + minor piece)\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black has strong pressure with rook on h3 and bishop on g6\n- White's knight on f8 is very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qb1# (queen to b1 would be checkmate)\n- Black's rook on h3 is eyeing h2, which could lead to mate threats\n- Black's bishop controls the long diagonal\n4. Available moves:\nOnly h1g2 and h1g1 are legal (king moves)\n5. Analysis of options:\n- h1g1:\n  * Gets out of potential back rank mates\n  * But leaves Qb1# threat still possible\n  * King remains somewhat exposed\n- h1g2:\n  * More active king position\n  * Covers h1 square against Qb1#\n  * Still keeps an eye on the h-file\n  * Better centralization for potential endgame\n  * Removes immediate mating threats\n6. Best move:\nh1g2 is clearly superior as it:\n- Prevents immediate mate threats\n- Centralizes the king\n- Maintains more flexibility\n- Is more active in general\nThe move h1g1 would be too passive and still leave some mating threats.\n```\nh1g2\n```"
