When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a knight on g5 that is very active and threatening\n3. Black has a rook on g6 defending against potential knight checks\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n5. White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous\nKey observations:\n- The knight on g5 is very strong and Black is struggling to defend against it\n- Black's rook on b8 is undefended\n- The queen on d2 has several interesting options\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5h7 - immediate knight sacrifice, but after Kxh7, Qh6+ Kg8, we don't have enough follow-up\n2. g5f7 - tempting fork, but after Kxf7, Qh5+ Ke8 and Black survives\n3. d2a5 - attacking the undefended rook on b8\n4. e1e4 - centralizing the rook with threats\n5. g5e6 - strong knight move threatening multiple things\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d2a5 looks very strong as it wins the rook on b8 immediately\n- Black can't defend both the rook and prevent mate threats\n- After Qa5, if Black moves the rook, we have Qxb8 winning material\n- If Black tries Qd7 to defend, we have Qxb8 Qxb8, Rxb8 winning the exchange\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous continuation. All other moves either don't win material or allow Black counterplay.\n```\nd2a5\n```"
