When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully.\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a bishop pair (Bc7 and Bg2) vs Black's bishop and queen\n2. Black's queen is very active on g3, attacking g2 bishop\n3. White has rooks on c1 and d2, Black has no rooks\n4. White has passed pawns on a5 and b4\n5. Black has a passed pawn on e5\n6. White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Bg2xf3 - removes Black's active bishop but gives up the bishop pair\n2. Rc1-c6 - centralizes the rook and threatens to go to g6\n3. a5-a6 - advances the passed pawn\n4. b4-b5 - advances the other passed pawn\n5. Bc7-d6 - blocks Black's d-pawn and keeps pressure\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Bg2xf3 Qg3xf3 leaves Black's queen very active\n- a5-a6 can be met with b7xa6 and Black gets counterplay\n- b4-b5 is interesting but doesn't address immediate threats\n- Rc1-c6 looks most promising, preparing to double rooks or go to g6\nThe best move appears to be Rc1-c6, which:\n1. Centralizes the rook\n2. Prepares potential doubling on the c-file\n3. Threatens Rg6 in some lines\n4. Maintains all options for pawn advances\n5. Doesn't allow Black any immediate counterplay\nHere's the move:\n```\nc1c6\n```"
