When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except White has an extra pawn)\n2. White has a strong bishop pair and active pieces\n3. Black has some weaknesses on the dark squares (f6, h6) due to the fianchettoed bishop being on g6\n4. Black's king is still in the center\n5. White has a strong queen on b3 putting pressure on b7 and f7\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f4h6 - This looks tempting to win the bishop, but after gxh6, White's attack may not be strong enough\n2. b3b7 - Immediate queen sacrifice, but after Rxb7 Bxb7, it's unclear if White has enough compensation\n3. g2c6 - Developing the bishop with tempo, attacking the queen\n4. e1g1 - Castling to safety\n5. g4g5 - Pushing the pawn to gain space and potentially open files\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- g2c6 looks very strong as it develops with tempo (Qd8 must move) and opens possibilities of doubling rooks on the d-file\n- Black's queen has few good squares after Bc6 (Qd7 blocks the bishop, Qc8 is passive)\n- This maintains all of White's positional advantages while increasing pressure\nThe best move is:\n```\ng2c6\n```"
