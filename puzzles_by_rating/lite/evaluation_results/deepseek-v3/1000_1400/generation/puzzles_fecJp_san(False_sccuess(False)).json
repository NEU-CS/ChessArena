When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Looking at the position:\n- White has a very active queen on h5 and knight on g6, attacking f8 and h8 squares\n- Black's king is on e7, which is very exposed\n- White's bishop on c4 is pinning the f7 pawn to the king\n- Black's king has no castling rights (no KQ in the notation)\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- e7e8: King moves to e8, but this walks into a discovered attack from the bishop on c4 (after Qxh7)\n- e7f7: King moves to f7, but then Qxh7+ wins the rook\n- e7d7: King moves to d7, but Qxh7 is still possible\n- e7e6: King moves to e6, but then Nxf8+ wins material\n- e7d6: King moves to d6, but Qxh7 is still possible\n- h7g6: The only move that doesn't immediately lose material - captures the knight with the pawn\n4. After h7g6:\n- If Qxg6, then Black can play Qxg6 (though White has compensation)\n- If Qxh8, then Qxg6 and Black is better\n- White might have other options, but this is the least bad\nThe other moves all lead to immediate material loss or checkmate threats. While h7g6 gives up the rook, it's the only move that doesn't lose immediately.\n```\nh7g6\n```"
