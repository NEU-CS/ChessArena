When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal, but White has a dangerous passed pawn on f6.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on f5 is very active, eyeing h7 and controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on the g-file with White's rook on f2\n- Black's queen is centralized but could be vulnerable\n- White's f6 pawn is a major threat that needs to be addressed\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential mating threats with Qh7#\n- The f6 pawn is threatening to promote\n- White could play Rf2-f8+ winning material\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2h5: Queen trade, but after Qxh5 Rxh5, White's f-pawn is still dangerous\n- f8e8: Rook moves to defend against Rf8+ ideas\n- b7c8: Bishop moves to potentially block Rf8+\n- h4g3: Creates counterplay by attacking the g2 bishop\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to bring the rook to e8 to:\n- Defend against Rf8+ threats\n- Keep the queen protected\n- Maintain flexibility in the position\nThe move also prepares potential counterplay along the e-file if White's queen moves. Other moves either don't address the immediate threats or lead to worse positions.\n```\nf8e8\n```"
