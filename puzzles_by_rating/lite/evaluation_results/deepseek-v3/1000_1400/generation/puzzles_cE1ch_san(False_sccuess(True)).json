When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (a8), Bishop (b6), Queen (d2), King (h5)\n- White has: Bishop (c6), Pawn (b5, d6, e4, f3, g6), Queen (f5), King (a4)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed but currently not in immediate danger\n- White has a passed pawn on d6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's queen is very active on d2\n- White's queen is also active on f5, eyeing h7\n3. Evaluating the two legal king moves:\n- h5h6: Moves the king forward, potentially exposing it more to checks from the white queen\n- h5h4: Moves the king towards the center and away from potential queen checks\n4. Potential threats:\n- After h5h6, Qf5-h7 could be dangerous, threatening mate\n- h5h4 keeps the king safer from queen checks and potential mating nets\n5. Best move:\nh5h4 is clearly better as it:\n- Moves the king towards a safer position\n- Avoids potential mating threats on the h-file\n- Maintains flexibility for the king to move further if needed\n```\nh5h4\n```"
