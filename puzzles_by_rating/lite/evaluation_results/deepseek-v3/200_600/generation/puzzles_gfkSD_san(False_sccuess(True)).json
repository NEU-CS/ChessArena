When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (c8), King (f8), Rook (e8), pawns (h7, a6, g6, f5), Bishop (a3), Bishop (a2)\n- White has: Rook (d8), Rook (d1), Knight (c6), Bishop (c4), pawns (e4, b3, f3, h2), King (c2)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed and under pressure from White's rook on d8\n- White has a strong knight on c6 attacking Black's rook on e8\n- Black's bishops are active but not immediately threatening\n- White has a passed pawn on e4 that could become dangerous\n3. The only legal move is c8d8, which is a rook move:\n- This would place the rook on d8, attacking White's rook on d8\n- After the exchange Rxd8 Rxd8, White would have a slight material advantage (minor piece vs pawn)\n- However, Black's king would remain exposed and White's pieces are more active\n4. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves available for Black\n- The position is very constrained due to White's control of key squares\n5. Evaluation:\n- The position is difficult for Black\n- The exchange of rooks is forced and leads to a worse endgame\n- However, it's the only legal move available\nSince c8d8 is the only legal move, Black must play it:\n```\nc8d8\n```"
