When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has some pressure on the long diagonal (c8-h3)\n4. Black's knight on c6 is somewhat awkward with the pawn on c4\n5. White's bishop on h4 is very active\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) h4f6 - This looks tempting as it forks queen and knight, but after Qxf6 Bxf6 Nxf6+ Rxf6, White gets two pieces for rook and pawn, which may not be best.\nB) e2h5 - Threatening to win the queen with Bh7+, but Black can defend with g6\nC) d1a4 - Putting pressure on the a4-e8 diagonal and potentially targeting the c4 pawn\nD) d2e4 - Centralizing the knight and threatening to jump to f6 or d6\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h4f6 gives up the strong bishop but wins material\n- e2h5 can be defended\n- d1a4 is interesting but doesn't create immediate threats\n- d2e4 is very strong, centralizing the knight with multiple threats (f6, d6, possibly g5)\nThe best move appears to be d2e4, which:\n1. Centralizes the knight\n2. Threatens Nf6+ winning the queen\n3. Prepares potential Nd6 attacks\n4. Maintains all of White's positional advantages\nBlack's best response would likely be Qe7 to defend f6, but then White can continue developing pressure.\n```\nd2e4\n```"
