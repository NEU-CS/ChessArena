When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key threats:\n- White's rook on e6 is very active and could potentially check the king if it moves to e8\n- White's queen on f5 is eyeing the h7 pawn and has potential to create threats\n- White's pawn on f4 could advance to f5, gaining more space\n3. Black's defensive needs:\n- King safety is critical - currently on h8\n- Need to protect the h7 pawn which is under threat from the queen\n- Need to maintain control of the e-file where White's rook is active\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: King moves to g8, getting away from potential checks on the h-file\n- f8f7: Rook moves to f7, defending h7 pawn and keeping control of the 7th rank\n- g7g6: Pushing the pawn to challenge White's queen\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h8g8 seems passive and allows White to increase pressure\n- g7g6 would weaken the kingside pawn structure\n- f8f7 is the most solid move, defending h7 and maintaining rook activity\nThe best move is:\n```\nf8f7\n```"
