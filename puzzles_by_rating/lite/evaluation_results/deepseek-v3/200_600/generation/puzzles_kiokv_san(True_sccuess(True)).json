When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Queen (b5), Knight (e5), pawns (b3, f4, h3, a2, c2, g2)\n- Black has: King (g8), Bishop (b7), Queen (d4), pawns (a5, b4, e6, f5, g7, h7)\n- Material is roughly equal (White has knight vs Black's bishop)\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b5 is very active, eyeing both the b7 bishop and f5 pawn\n- Black's queen is centralized but potentially exposed\n- White's knight on e5 is strong, but Black can challenge it with ...f4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with limited pawn cover\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxb7 winning the bishop\n- White could also play Qd7 with threats against the black king\n- Black needs to address these threats while maintaining counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Qxe5: Seems tempting but after Nxe5, White gets a strong knight and Black's structure is weakened\n- Qd5: Defends b7 and maintains central presence\n- Qd8: Retreats but seems passive\n- Bc8: Defends b7 but blocks king's escape route\n- h6/g6: Improves king safety but doesn't address immediate threats\n5. Best move appears to be Qd5:\n- Defends the b7 bishop\n- Maintains central control\n- Prepares potential ...f4 to challenge the knight\n- Keeps options open for king safety moves later\nAfter Qd5, if White plays Qxb7, Black has Qxb5 winning the queen back with a roughly equal position.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQd5\n```"
