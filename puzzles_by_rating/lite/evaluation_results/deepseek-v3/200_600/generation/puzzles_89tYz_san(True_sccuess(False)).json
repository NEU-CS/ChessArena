        "content": "Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.\n**Position Analysis:**\n- White has a king on g6, pawns on g4 and h5\n- Black has a king on d2 and a pawn on b3\n- It's White's turn to move (as indicated by \"w\" in the FEN)\n**Key Observations:**\n1. Black's pawn is very advanced (b3) and could potentially queen soon\n2. White has two connected passed pawns (g4 and h5)\n3. White's king is well-placed to support the pawns or try to stop Black's pawn\n4. Black's king is somewhat distant from both sets of pawns\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n1) King moves towards Black's pawn:\n   - Kf5: heads towards b3 but might be too slow\n   - Kg5: similar idea but slightly less direct\n   - Other king moves away from the pawns seem less effective\n2) Pawn moves:\n   - h6: doesn't accomplish much, just fixes the pawn\n   - g5: pushes the pawn forward but might not be urgent\n3) King moves supporting our pawns:\n   - Kh6/Kh7: prepares to push h-pawn\n   - Kg7/Kf7: less useful\n   - Kf6: centralizes king while keeping options open\n**Best Plan:**\nThe most urgent matter is Black's passed pawn. White's king should try to intercept it while our pawns are not in immediate danger. The connected pawns can advance later when the king is closer.\n**Calculating Kf5:**\nAfter 1.Kf5 Kc3 2.Ke4 b2 3.Kd3 (only move to stop promotion) Kb3 and Black queens anyway.\n**Alternative Idea:**\nMaybe we should push our pawns first since our king can't stop Black's pawn alone. The race might be winning for White.\n**Calculating g5:**\n1.g5 Kc3 2.g6 Kb2 3.g7 b2 4.g8=Q b1=Q\nNow White has queen vs queen, but our h-pawn is still there which could be decisive.\n**Even Better:**\nAfter 1.g5 Kc3 2.g6 Kb2 3.h6 b2 4.h7 b1=Q 5.h8=Q and White has two queens vs one, which should be winning.\n**Conclusion:**\nPushing the g-pawn immediately starts a winning pawn race. The connected pawns will promote faster than Black's single pawn, especially with our king already well-placed to support them.\n```\ng5\n```"
