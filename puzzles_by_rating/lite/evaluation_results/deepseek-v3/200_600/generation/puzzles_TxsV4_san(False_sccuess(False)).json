When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong knight on g4 attacking our bishop on e3\n3. Our knight on d4 is very active and can potentially fork pieces\n4. Black's king is still in the center while ours is castled\n5. Black has some pressure on the dark squares (e6, f5, g4)\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) d4e6 - Forking queen and bishop. However, after fxe6 our knight is lost and we don't get enough compensation.\nB) e3g5 - Trading the bishop for the knight. This relieves pressure but gives Black the bishop pair.\nC) d4f5 - Attacking the queen while defending our e3 bishop. This looks promising as after Qxf5, exf5 we win a pawn and open the e-file.\nD) e2g4 - Trading queens but this seems too simplifying when we have attacking chances.\nE) c2h7 - Sacrificing the bishop with check. After Kxh7, Qxg4 we have some play but it's unclear.\nAfter careful consideration, d4f5 seems strongest:\n1. It defends our bishop on e3\n2. It attacks the queen\n3. After Qxf5 exf5, we win a pawn and open lines\n4. Even if Black avoids with Qe7, we maintain pressure\nOther moves either don't solve our problems or give up our initiative. The pawn capture line seems most promising.\n```\nd4f5\n```"
