When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n   - Black has a knight on e4 that's quite active\n   - White's knight on b3 is well placed but could be more active\n   - White's bishop on c1 is blocked by pawns\n   - Black's king is still in the center (castled queenside)\n   - White has the option to castle queenside\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b3d4 - Challenging the strong e4 knight\n   - After 1...exd4 2.Nxd4, we get rid of the strong knight but give up our own\n   - Or 1...Nxd4 2.Qxd4, but this seems equal\n2. c1h6 - Developing the bishop with tempo (threatening g7)\n   - Black can defend with ...f6 or ...g6, but this seems promising\n   - This also opens the possibility of castling queenside\n3. e1e4 - Trading rooks on e4\n   - After 1...Nxe4 2.Nxe4 Rxe4, we get rid of the knight but lose the rook exchange\n   - Not ideal\n4. c2c4 - Gaining space in the center\n   - But doesn't address the immediate knight issue\nAfter considering these options, c1h6 seems the most promising as it:\n- Develops a piece\n- Creates threats against Black's kingside\n- Maintains flexibility for castling\n- Doesn't weaken our position\nThe other moves either don't improve our position or lead to exchanges that don't benefit us.\n```\nc1h6\n```"
