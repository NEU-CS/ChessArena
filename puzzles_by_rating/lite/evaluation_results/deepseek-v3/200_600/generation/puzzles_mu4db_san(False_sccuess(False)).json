When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (e4), Rook (e1), Queen (c2), Knight (c6), 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook (a8), Rook (f6), Bishop (e6), Queen (b5), 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has knight vs Black's bishop and extra pawn)\n2. Key features:\n- White has strong pressure on the e-file with both rooks\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's knight on c6 is very active\n- Black's queen is active but potentially exposed on b5\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to double rooks on the e-file with Ree1-e3\n- White could play Qc2xb5, but after axb5 the a-pawn becomes strong\n- Black needs to address the pressure on the e-file\n4. Candidate moves:\n- a8e8: Defends e6 but leaves a8 rook passive\n- f6e5: Challenges the rook but allows Nxe5\n- e6e7: Blocks the e-file but leaves bishop passive\n- b5b6: Queen retreat but gives up pressure\n- b5c6: Queen exchange, but after Qxc6 Rxc6, White has pressure\n5. Best move seems to be b5c6, forcing a queen exchange:\n- After Qxc6 Rxc6, Black can play e6d5 next, activating the bishop\n- This reduces White's attacking potential\n- The resulting position should be roughly equal\nHere's the move:\n```\nb5c6\n```"
