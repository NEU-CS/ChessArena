When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. White has a knight on g5 attacking f7, which is only defended by the black king\n3. Black has a bishop on g4 pinning the white queen to the king\n4. White has castling rights (KQ) while Black has already castled (r in their FEN)\nKey observations:\n- The knight on g5 is very active and threatens f7\n- The pin on the queen is annoying but can be broken\n- White has potential for a kingside attack\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5h7 - attacking the rook, but after ...Kxh7 white doesn't have immediate compensation\n2. g5f7 - sacrifing the knight, but after ...Rxf7 white's queen is still pinned\n3. f3g4 - breaking the pin by capturing the bishop\n4. e1g1 - castling to safety\n5. c1f4 - developing the bishop with tempo on the queen\nBest options seem to be:\n- f3g4: Immediately breaks the pin and maintains pressure\n- g5f7: Interesting sacrifice but needs calculation\nCalculating g5f7:\n12. g5f7 Rxf7 (forced) 13. f3g4 Qxg4 14. Qxf7+ Kh8 - white has rook for knight but black's queen is active\nCalculating f3g4:\n12. f3g4 Qxg4 13. g5f7+ Kh8 14. Nxh7 - wins the exchange (rook for knight) with a strong position\nThe f3g4 line seems more promising as it breaks the pin while maintaining the initiative. After 12.f3g4 Qxg4 13.g5f7+ Kh8 14.Nxh7, white wins material and has a strong attack.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf3g4\n```"
