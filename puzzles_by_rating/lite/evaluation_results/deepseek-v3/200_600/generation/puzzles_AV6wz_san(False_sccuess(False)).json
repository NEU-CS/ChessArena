When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: White's king is slightly safer as it's castled while Black's king is still on g8. Black's rook on e8 is active but not directly threatening.\n3. Piece activity: White's queen on f3 is very active, bishop on d2 is decent, rook on a1 is not yet active. Black's queen on e7 is somewhat passive, rook on e8 is active, knight on f6 is solid.\n4. Pawn structure: White has a passed d-pawn but it's not yet advanced. Black has a slight weakness on c6 that could be targeted.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- f3f6: This looks very promising as it attacks the knight and threatens to win material (if ...gxf6 then Qxf6+ wins the rook)\n- d2h6: Threatening to sacrifice on g7, but Black can defend with ...Qf7\n- d4d5: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n- a1e1: Activating the rook, but not forcing\nAfter careful consideration, f3f6 seems strongest as it:\n1. Attacks the knight immediately\n2. If Black takes with ...gxf6, then Qxf6+ wins the rook\n3. If Black moves the knight, we can consider follow-ups like Qxc6 or other active moves\n4. It maintains maximum pressure on Black's position\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate.\n```\nf3f6\n```"
