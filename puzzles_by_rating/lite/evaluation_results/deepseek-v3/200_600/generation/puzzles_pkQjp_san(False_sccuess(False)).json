When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black: Rook (e8), pawns (a6, c5, g7, h6)\n- White: Rook (d7), Queen (e6), pawns (a2, c3, g6, h2)\nWhite has a significant material advantage with queen vs no queen.\n2. King safety:\n- Black king is on h8, somewhat exposed\n- White king is on h3, relatively safe\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White has a passed pawn on g6 threatening to promote\n- White's queen and rook are very active\n- Black's rook is currently passive on e8\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Rook moves: e8g8 seems most logical to defend the g7 pawn\n- Pawn moves: h6h5 or c5c4 could create some counterplay\n5. Evaluation:\n- If Black does nothing, White will push g6-g7 and promote\n- Black needs to defend g7 while trying to create counterplay\nBest move seems e8g8:\n- Defends the g7 pawn directly\n- Prepares potential rook activation via g8-g3+\n- Keeps the rook connected to the king for defense\nOther options:\n- e8e7 blocks the queen but allows g6-g7\n- h6h5 weakens the kingside further\n- c5c4 doesn't address the immediate threat\nAfter e8g8, White will likely play g6-g7, but Black can then consider moves like g8-g3+ to harass the white king.\nFinal move:\n```\ne8g8\n```"
