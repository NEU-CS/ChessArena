When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a rook (c1), pawns (a4, b3, e3, e4), and a king on e2. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's king is exposed on e2 with Black's rook on h3 eyeing the 2nd rank.\n- Black's rook on f6 is very active and can potentially join the attack.\n- White's pawn structure is solid but lacks dynamic potential.\n- Black's pawns are mostly passive but the h6 pawn could become dangerous if advanced.\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h3h2: Direct attack on White's king, forcing it to move.\n- f6f2: Sacrificing the rook to expose White's king, but seems premature.\n- f6f1: Threatening the white rook, but allows White counterplay.\n- h6h5: Preparing to push the h-pawn, but slow.\n4. Best move seems to be h3h2:\n- It immediately threatens the white king, forcing it to move.\n- After Ke1 or Ke3, Black can follow up with f6f1 or f6f2 to increase pressure.\n- White has no good way to defend against this direct attack.\n- Other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate.\n5. Calculating variations:\n- If h3h2 Ke1, then f6f1 is strong, pinning the rook.\n- If h3h2 Ke3, then f6f3+ wins material.\n- White has no good defensive resources against this plan.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh3h2\n```"
