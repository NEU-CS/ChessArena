When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black has strong pressure on the dark squares (bishop on f4)\n- Black's rook on c4 is very active\n- White's knight is well-placed on g3\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on b1\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5d6: Pushing the passed pawn, but after ...Bxd6, Black gets strong counterplay\n- g3f5: Centralizing the knight, attacking e7 and d6 squares\n- e1e3: Doubling rooks on the d-file\n- c3b4: Challenging Black's active rook\n4. Best move seems to be g3f5 because:\n- It centralizes the knight to a strong outpost\n- Threatens to jump to e7 or d6\n- Prepares to support the d-pawn advance\n- Controls important squares in Black's camp\n- If Black takes with ...exf5, White recaptures with exf5, opening the e-file for the rook\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- d5d6 allows ...Bxd6 with counterplay\n- e1e3 allows Black to maintain pressure\n- c3b4 is met with ...Rxb4, giving Black more active play\nAfter g3f5, if Black plays ...exf5, then exf5 opens the e-file and activates White's rook. If Black doesn't take, the knight remains very strong on f5.\n```\ng3f5\n```"
