When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has rook, bishop vs White's queen, rook, pawns\n- Black is down material (rook+bishop vs queen is roughly equal, but White has extra rook and pawns)\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very active, eyeing the a1-h8 diagonal\n- Black's rook on e8 is tied to defending the e-file\n- Black's bishop on a2 is poorly placed, blocked by its own pawns\n- White has a passed pawn on c2 that could become dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to play Rd7, attacking the weak f7 pawn\n- White could also consider Qe7, pinning the f7 pawn to the king\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8/g8f8 - King moves to safer squares\n- e8e7 - Blocking the e-file, but allows Qxe7\n- a2b3 - Developing the bishop, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f7f6 - Creates luft but weakens e6\n- h7h6 - Creates luft without major weaknesses\n5. Best choice:\nThe most prudent move appears to be creating luft with h7h6. This:\n- Gives the king an escape square\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Maintains flexibility\n- Prepares potential future ...Kh7 if needed\nOther options either don't address the king safety or create weaknesses. The bishop is bad but can't be improved immediately without concessions.\n```\nh7h6\n```"
