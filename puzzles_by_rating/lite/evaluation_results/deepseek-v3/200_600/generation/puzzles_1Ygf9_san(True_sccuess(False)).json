If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Key features:\n   - White's e-pawn is passed and could become dangerous\n   - Black's rook on f6 is active but potentially vulnerable\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n   - White's rook is very active on f1\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Rxf6: Immediate capture, but after ...Rxf6, Black's rook remains active\n   - Rf5: Centralizing the rook, threatening to go after Black's pawns\n   - e5: Advancing the passed pawn, but allows ...Rxe5\n   - Kg1: King safety, but doesn't improve the position\n4. Best options:\n   - Rxf6 seems tempting but leads to equal material and Black's rook remains active\n   - Rf5 is more promising as it centralizes the rook and threatens to attack Black's pawns (c5 and a6)\n   - After Rf5, Black has to defend carefully. If ...Rxf5, exf5 gives White a passed f-pawn\n   - If Black doesn't take, White can consider Rxc5 next, winning a pawn\n5. Other moves like pawn pushes don't seem as effective in this position.\nThe most active and promising move is Rf5, centralizing the rook and creating multiple threats.\n```\nRf5\n```"
