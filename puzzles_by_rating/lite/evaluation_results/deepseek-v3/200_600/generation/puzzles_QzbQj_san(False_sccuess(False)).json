When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (1 rook, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 knights, pawns). Black has doubled rooks on the c-file which could be useful.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on f6, pinning the black pawn on e6 to the black king\n- Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n- White has pressure on the kingside with queen on d3 and knight on f3\n- Black has some potential play on the queenside with the a5 knight and b5 pawn\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7f6: Capturing the strong bishop, but after Qxf6, White maintains pressure\n- c8c3: Trying to create counterplay on the queenside\n- d8d7: Moving the queen to connect rooks and defend the bishop\n- b7a8: Retreating the bishop to safety\n4. Best move seems to be c8c3:\n- Creates immediate threats on the queenside\n- Attacks the pawn on a3\n- Prepares potential doubling of rooks on the c-file\n- If White takes with b2xc3, then a5xc4 gains a pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can increase pressure with moves like Qb6 or Rfc8\nOther options:\n- e7f6 is too passive and just trades a good bishop\n- d8d7 doesn't create any threats\n- b7a8 retreats without purpose\nHere's the move:\n```\nc8c3\n```"
