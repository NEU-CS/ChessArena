When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, 2 pawns\n- White has: Queen, 2 Rooks, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black has minor piece vs White's extra pawn)\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on e8, attacking Black's rook on d8\n- Black's queen is on g5, eyeing White's kingside\n- Black's knight on g6 is somewhat passive\n- White has doubled rooks on the e-file\n3. Candidate moves:\na) d8e8 - trading rooks but allowing White to recapture with queen\n   After 1...d8e8 2.Qxe8, Black's position becomes passive\nb) g6f8 - moving knight to defend the rook\n   This maintains material balance and keeps more pieces active\n4. Evaluation:\n- d8e8 leads to simplification where White's queen becomes very active\n- g6f8 maintains tension and keeps more pieces on the board\n- With Black's queen actively placed, keeping more pieces favors Black\n5. Potential threats:\n- White might try to play Re7 or Qe7 in some lines\n- Black's queen can create threats against White's king\nThe best move is to defend the rook with the knight, maintaining piece activity and avoiding simplification that would favor White.\n```\ng6f8\n```"
