When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and bishop vs White's rook, bishop and pawn. White is up a pawn.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on h6 is very active, pinning Black's g-pawn to the king\n- Black's rook on e8 is active but somewhat exposed\n- White's king is exposed on d2\n- Black's bishop on e4 is well placed but could be vulnerable\n- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to play h5, opening lines against Black's king\n- Black needs to find active counterplay or defensive resources\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8e7: Centralizing the rook, but allows White to play h5 with tempo\n- e4f5: Bishop moves to attack h3 pawn, but h5 is still coming\n- g6g5: Trying to block the h-pawn, but weakens the kingside\n- e4d3: Trading bishops, but after Kxd3 White's king is safer\n5. Best move seems e4d3:\n- Forces the trade of bishops\n- After Kxd3, Black can play e8e5, activating the rook\n- Reduces White's attacking potential\n- Keeps the position more balanced\nThe alternative g6g5 is too weakening as after hxg5 hxg5, White's rook gets active on the f-file.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne4d3\n```"
