If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- Black has a strong passed pawn on c4\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n- Black's rook on c8 is very active\n- White's d5 pawn is strong but blockaded\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Nh5: Could target f6/g7, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- Rd4: Challenges Black's rook and defends c4 pawn indirectly\n- d6: Pushing the passed pawn, but may be premature\n- Rf3: Defends against Bg5 ideas and prepares to double rooks\n4. Best move seems to be Rd4 because:\n- It challenges Black's active rook on c4\n- If Black takes (Rxd4), we recapture with cxd4 and our pawn structure improves\n- If Black moves the rook, we gain time to activate our pieces\n- It maintains control over key squares\nOther moves either don't address the immediate pressure or create new weaknesses.\n```\nRd4\n```"
