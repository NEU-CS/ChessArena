When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Black has queen + knight vs White's queen + bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on b4 which could become dangerous.\n2. King safety: Both kings are somewhat exposed. Black's king is on g7 while White's is on g1. White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 square.\n3. Immediate threats: White's bishop on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares. The h5 pawn is also threatening to advance.\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7f5: Queen moves to f5, attacking the g3 queen while also defending the knight\n- d5f6: Knight moves to f6, defending against potential queen checks\n- d7e7: Queen moves to e7, centralizing and defending the knight\n- g7g6: King moves to g6, getting away from potential checks\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d7f5 looks tempting but after Qxf5 Nxf5, Bxf5 leaves White with bishop vs knight and a strong passed pawn\n- d5f6 is solid but allows White to keep pressure with Qg4\n- g7g6 is too passive and allows White to push the h-pawn\n- d7e7 seems most flexible, keeping the queen active while defending the knight\nThe best move appears to be d7e7, maintaining control of key squares and keeping options open. It prevents any immediate tactical threats while keeping the queen centralized.\n```\nd7e7\n```"
