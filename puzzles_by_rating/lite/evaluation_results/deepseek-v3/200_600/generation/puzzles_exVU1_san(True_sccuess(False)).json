When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "```\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. The FEN shows it's Black's turn to move (indicated by 'b' after the position)\n2. Material is equal - both sides have a pawn and a knight, but White has an extra pawn (b4 vs d5)\n3. Black's king is at c4, White's king at g2, White's knight at d3\n4. Black's pawn is at d5, White's pawn at b4\nKey observations:\n- White's knight is currently attacking Black's pawn on d5\n- Black's king is very active in the center\n- White's pawn on b4 is passed but not yet dangerous\n- The position appears roughly equal, but Black has some initiative due to king activity\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Kb5 - Centralizing the king and attacking the b4 pawn\n2. Kd4 - Also centralizing, but doesn't immediately threaten anything\n3. Kxd3 - Capturing the knight, but after Kxd3, White's king can defend the pawn ending\n4. Kc3 - Less active than other king moves\n5. Kb3 - Similar to Kb5 but less aggressive\n6. d4 - Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn\nBest move analysis:\n- Kxd3 leads to a drawn pawn ending after 1...Kxd3 2.Kf3 Ke3 3.Ke3 d4+ 4.Kd3 Kd5 etc.\n- d4 creates a passed pawn but after 1...d4 2.Nf4 the knight becomes very active\n- Kb5 is most active, threatening the b4 pawn and maintaining central control\nAfter 1...Kb5:\n- If 2.Nc5 then 2...Kxb4 3.Nxd5+ Kc5 and Black should win the pawn ending\n- If 2.b5 then 2...Kc5 and Black's king dominates\n- White has no good way to defend the b4 pawn\nTherefore, Kb5 is the strongest move, activating the king maximally while creating threats against White's pawn structure.\n```\nKb5\n```"
