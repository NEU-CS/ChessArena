When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except White has an extra pawn)\n2. White has a strong pawn on e5 and active pieces (Ng5, Bh4)\n3. Black's king is still in the center (though castled, the e-file is open)\n4. White has pressure on f7 (Ng5 eyeing it, Bh4 supporting)\n5. Black's dark-squared bishop is very active on c5\nKey observations:\n- White's pieces are more active and coordinated\n- Black needs to complete development and secure the king\n- The immediate threat is Ng5xf7, which would be dangerous after ...Kxf7 Bh4xe7+\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g6h4 - trades off the dangerous bishop, but leaves f7 weak\n2. f7f6 - challenges the knight but opens the e-file\n3. d7d5 - counter in the center but allows exd6\n4. c5e7 - retreats the bishop but blocks the queen\n5. d8e7 - connects rooks and defends e7\nBest move seems to be d8e7 because:\n- Connects the rooks\n- Defends the e7 square against Bh4xe7+\n- Maintains flexibility\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Prepares to possibly double rooks on the e-file\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- f7f6 opens the position when we're not ready\n- g6h4 gives up the bishop pair\n- c5e7 blocks the queen\n- d7d5 is too loosening\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd8e7\n```"
