When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has queen, bishop, knight vs White's rook, knight, bishop). However, White has a more active rook on e5 and knight on d4.\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on e5 is very active, eyeing the e-file and potentially threatening to penetrate.\n- Black's queen on c6 is centralized but could be vulnerable.\n- Black's knight on c3 is well-placed but could be challenged.\n- Black's king is still in the center (g8) which could be a concern.\n3. Threats:\n- White's knight on d4 could potentially fork the queen and bishop with Nf5.\n- White could play Bxc3 at some point, damaging Black's pawn structure.\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c6e8: Queen retreat to defend the king and connect rooks\n- c8e6: Bishop development, challenging White's rook\n- g8h8: King safety move\n- c3e4: Knight move attacking the rook\n- c6d6: Queen move defending the knight\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c3e4 looks tempting to attack the rook, but after Rxe4 Qxe4 Nxe4, Black loses material.\n- c6e8 is solid but passive.\n- c8e6 is interesting but after Rxe6 Qxe6, Black's queen is overworked.\n- g8h8 is safe but doesn't address the immediate position.\nThe best move appears to be c6d6, defending the knight on c3 while maintaining central control. This prevents any immediate tactics and keeps options open for future play.\n```\nc6d6\n```"
