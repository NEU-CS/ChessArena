When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong centralized queen on e4 and pawn on d4\n- Black's queen is very active on g5\n- Black has a knight on d3 that's forking White's rook and bishop\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n- Black has potential threats against White's king\n3. Immediate threats:\n- The knight on d3 is attacking White's rook on d1 and bishop on b2\n- White's queen on e4 is unprotected and could be a target\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5d2: Queen takes bishop, but after Qxd3 we lose the queen\n- g5e3: Queen checks the king, but after Kc1 we don't have a clear follow-up\n- d3e1: Knight takes rook, but White can play Qxe1 with advantage\n- d3f2: Knight fork attacking queen and rook\n- g5f5: Queen moves to maintain pressure while keeping an eye on e4\nAfter careful consideration, d3f2 seems the most promising:\n- It forks White's queen and rook\n- If White moves the queen, we take the rook\n- If White takes the knight with Qxf2, we have Qxc1+ winning material\n- It maintains pressure while developing threats\nOther moves either lose material or don't create enough threats. The knight fork is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for White.\n```\nd3f2\n```"
