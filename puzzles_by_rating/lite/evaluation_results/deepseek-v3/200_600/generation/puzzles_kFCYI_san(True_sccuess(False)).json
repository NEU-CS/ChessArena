If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed on a6\n- Black's bishop on d4 is unprotected\n- White has a rook battery on the b-file\n- Black's pawn structure is slightly weak with isolated pawns\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rb6+: Immediate check that forces the black king to move\n- Bxd4: Capturing the unprotected bishop\n- Rb5: Preparing to double rooks or attack the d5 pawn\n4. Analysis of Rb6+:\n- Kxb6 is forced (other moves lose material)\n- Then Bxd4 wins a piece as the bishop was unprotected\n- After ...exd4, White has won a bishop for a pawn\n5. Analysis of Bxd4:\n- Immediate material gain\n- But after ...Rxd4, Black gets active rooks\n- White's advantage is less clear\n6. Analysis of Rb5:\n- Prepares to double rooks\n- But doesn't immediately exploit Black's weaknesses\nThe most forcing and advantageous line is Rb6+, winning material by deflection. After Kxb6 Bxd4, White is clearly better with an extra piece.\n```\nRb6+\n```"
