If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal (rook \u2248 bishop + pawn).\n2. Key features:\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed on b1\n   - White's rook on a7 is very active\n   - Both sides have passed pawns (White's f4, Black's b3)\n   - Black's bishop is somewhat restricted by its own pawns\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Bishop moves: Bc4 looks interesting, eyeing f1 square to potentially support the b-pawn's promotion\n   - King moves: Kc1 gets the king closer to the center and potentially safer\n   - Pawn moves: b2 advances the passed pawn, but might be premature\n4. Threats:\n   - White could play Kxb3 next move if we don't defend the pawn\n   - White's rook could become more active if we don't restrain it\n5. Best options:\n   - Bc4 defends the b3 pawn while activating the bishop\n   - Kc1 is solid but doesn't improve our position much\n   - b2 is tempting but White can play Kxb2 immediately\nAfter considering all options, Bc4 seems most principled:\n- Defends the b3 pawn\n- Eyes the f1 square to support pawn promotion\n- Keeps options open for both kingside and queenside play\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\nThe other bishop moves either don't defend b3 or create other issues. Pawn moves seem premature at this stage.\n<move>\nBc4\n</move>\n```"
