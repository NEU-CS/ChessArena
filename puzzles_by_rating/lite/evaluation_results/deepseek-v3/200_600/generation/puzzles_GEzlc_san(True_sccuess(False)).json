If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White is up a rook but Black has some compensation with active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White has doubled rooks on the c-file and a passed c6 pawn\n- Black's queen is very active on d5\n- Black's bishop on b8 is trapped but defended by the rook\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxc8: Wins the bishop but after Rxc8, Black's rook becomes active\n- Qxe4: Wins a pawn but opens up the position for Black's pieces\n- c7: Advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n- Rc5: Pins the queen to the king\n4. Best move seems to be Rxc8:\n- It wins material (bishop for rook)\n- After Rxc8 Rxc8, White can play Qd4 pinning the rook to the king\n- Black's queen must move, allowing Rxc8 winning the exchange\n- Even if Black finds resources, White remains up material\nOther moves:\n- Qxe4 allows ...Qd1+ with counterplay\n- c7 allows ...Qd1+ with checks\n- Rc5 is met by ...Qd6 defending\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxc8\n```"
