When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Rook, Bishop, Knight and pawns). Black has doubled rooks on the c-file and b-file, while White has rooks on c4 and e1.\n2. King safety: Black's king is on g8 with pawns on f7 and g7. White's king is on f3, which is somewhat exposed.\n3. Key features:\n   - Black's bishop on e5 is very active\n   - White's knight on d3 is well placed\n   - Black has pressure along the b-file and c-file\n   - White's rook on c4 is vulnerable to attacks\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e5b8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n   - e5f4: Attacks the king and gains a tempo\n   - c8e8: Centralizes the rook and connects with bishop\n   - b2e2: Pins the e2 pawn to the king\n   - b2b3: Attacks the b3 pawn\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- e5f4 looks very strong as it:\n  - Attacks the king directly\n  - Forces White to respond (either Kxf4 or Kg2)\n  - Opens lines for Black's rooks\n  - If Kxf4, then c8f8+ wins material\n  - If Kg2, then b2e2 maintains pressure\nOther moves like b2b3 are also interesting, but e5f4 seems more forcing and creates immediate threats.\nHere's the move:\n```\ne5f4\n```"
