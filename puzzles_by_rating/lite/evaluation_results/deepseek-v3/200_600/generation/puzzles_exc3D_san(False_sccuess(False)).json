When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully.\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a strong attacking position with active pieces (Bd4, Nc3, Ng5, Qf3)\n2. Black's king is still in the center (e8) and looks vulnerable\n3. White has a space advantage with pawns on e5 and f4\n4. Black has some weaknesses on the dark squares around their king\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5h7 - Knight sacrifice to open up Black's king position\n2. f3d5 - Centralizing the queen with threats\n3. d4a7 - Bishop sacrifice to remove an important defender (Qc7)\n4. h4h5 - Pushing the pawn to open lines against the king\nLet me evaluate these:\n1. g5h7:\nAfter Nxh7 Rxh7, we can play Qf6+ with strong threats. Black's king would be very exposed. This looks promising.\n2. f3d5:\nQd5 is solid but allows Black to defend with ...Nf8 or ...Qd8. Not as forcing.\n3. d4a7:\nBxa7 Qxa7 and while we win the queen, Black gets counterplay with ...Ra8. Not clearly winning.\n4. h4h5:\nGood long-term plan but not as forcing as the knight sacrifice.\nThe knight sacrifice on h7 looks most promising. After:\n17. Nxh7 Rxh7\n18. Qf6+ Ke7 (forced)\n19. Bg7! with devastating threats (Rh8 is coming, or Bxh6 next)\nBlack has no good defense. For example:\n19...Rg8 20. Rh8! wins material\n19...Rhh8 20. Bxh6 and Black's position collapses\nTherefore, the best move is the knight sacrifice:\n```\ng5h7\n```"
