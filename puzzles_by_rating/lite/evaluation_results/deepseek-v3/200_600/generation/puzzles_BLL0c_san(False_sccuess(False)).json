When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king, knight, bishop, 3 pawns\n- White has: king, bishop, rook, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces and passed pawns.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed d6 pawn supported by the rook\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on c8\n- White's bishop on b6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's pieces are somewhat passive (knight on h8, bishop on e7)\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rd7 next, putting pressure on f7\n- White's pawns on c4 and g4 are mobile\n- Black needs to activate pieces and create counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h8h7: Gets the knight into play, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c8b8: Moves king to safer square, but passive\n- e7g6: Bishop gets more active, eyes h5 pawn\n- e7c6: Challenges strong bishop, but b6 bishop is well placed\n- d7e6: Centralizes knight, but allows Rd7\n- b5b4: Creates passed pawn, but weakens a5 square\n5. Best move seems e7g6:\n- Activates the bishop\n- Eyes the h5 pawn which could become weak\n- Prepares to challenge White's bishop with ...Bh5\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Maintains flexibility\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or create weaknesses. The bishop is currently doing nothing on e7, and g6 is its most active square.\n```\ne7g6\n```"
