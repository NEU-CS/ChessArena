When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

First, let's understand the position:\n   - White has a queen on h6, rook on e5, bishop on f3, pawns on c2, g2, f2, h2, and king on g1.\n   - Black has a rook on f8, king on g8, pawns on a7, c7, f7, g6, h7, and a rook on b1.\n   - White is to move (as indicated by \"w\" in the FEN).\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's queen on h6 is very active and threatening against Black's king.\n   - Black's rook on b1 is attacking White's undefended pawn on c2.\n   - White's rook on e5 is very active in the center.\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed.\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n   a) h6c1 - Queen takes rook on c1:\n      - This would win the exchange (queen for rook), but after ...bxc1=Q, Black gets a new queen.\n      - Black would then have queen and rook vs White's queen and rook, but White's pieces are more active.\n      - However, this allows Black to activate their pieces.\n   b) e5e1 - Rook to e1:\n      - This defends the c2 pawn by pinning the Black rook to the king.\n      - After this, Black would likely move their rook (maybe to b2 or b4).\n      - This maintains White's strong positional advantages.\n   c) f3d1 - Bishop to d1:\n      - This also defends the c2 pawn.\n      - But it blocks the e1 square for the rook and is less active than e5e1.\n4. Best move analysis:\n   - e5e1 is the most principled move:\n     * It defends the pawn while maintaining all of White's active pieces.\n     * It keeps the queen on h6 which is very dangerous for Black's king.\n     * It maintains the pin on the Black rook.\n     * It doesn't allow Black any counterplay.\n   - h6c1, while winning material, gives Black too much activity.\n   - f3d1 is passive and blocks the rook's activity.\n5. Potential follow-ups after e5e1:\n   - Black might play Rb2 or Rb4, but White can continue with Qg7+ or other active moves.\n   - White's pieces are all well coordinated and active.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5e1\n```"
