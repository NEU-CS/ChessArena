When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on e6 that is very dangerous\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n- White's rook is actively placed on d1\n- Black's rook is currently passive on e8\n3. Threats:\n- White's main threat is pushing e6-e7, creating a passed pawn that will be hard to stop\n- White might also try to activate their king\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8e7: Blocking the pawn immediately\n- h8g8: Moving the king to a safer square\n- e8g8: Connecting rooks and getting the king off the back rank\n5. Evaluation:\n- e8e7 seems most logical to stop the pawn advance, but after 26...e8e7 27.Rd7 White's rook becomes very active\n- h8g8 is safe but doesn't address the pawn threat\n- e8g8 is interesting as it connects the rooks and gets the king off the back rank while keeping options to stop the pawn\nThe best move appears to be e8g8, as it:\n- Gets the king to a safer square\n- Connects the rooks\n- Maintains flexibility to deal with the e-pawn\n- Doesn't allow White's rook immediate penetration like e8e7 would\nAfter e8g8, if White plays e6e7, we can respond with g8f7 to blockade the pawn.\n```\ne8g8\n```"
