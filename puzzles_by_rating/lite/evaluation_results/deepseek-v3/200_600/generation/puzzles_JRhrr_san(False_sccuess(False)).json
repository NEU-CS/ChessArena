The position is:\n- White has a king on g8 and a pawn on e4\n- Black has a king on a2 and a pawn on a6\nKey observations:\n1. Material is equal (king + pawn each)\n2. White's pawn is further advanced (e4 vs a6)\n3. Black's king is somewhat restricted by the edge of the board\n4. White's king is more centralized\nThe critical factor is whose pawn will promote first:\n- White's pawn needs 4 moves to promote (e4-e5-e6-e7-e8)\n- Black's pawn needs 5 moves to promote (a6-a5-a4-a3-a2-a1)\nHowever, the kings' positions are crucial:\n- If Black's king can stop White's pawn while advancing its own, it can draw or win\n- White's king is currently too far to stop Black's pawn immediately\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n1. a6a5 - Advances the pawn, but doesn't improve king position\n2. a2b3 - Moves king toward center and White's pawn\n3. a2a3 - Similar to b3 but less central\n4. a2b2 - Doesn't make progress\n5. a2b1/a2a1 - Wastes time moving away\nThe best move is a2b3 because:\n- It brings the king closer to both pawns\n- It maintains the option to go after White's pawn if needed\n- It keeps the a-pawn protected (king can return to a2 if needed)\n- It's more flexible than pawn moves\nAfter a2b3, Black can consider:\n- If White pushes e5, Black can respond with b3c4 to block the pawn\n- If White doesn't push, Black can advance the a-pawn\nOther moves either don't improve the position or waste time. The pawn move a6a5 is playable but less flexible than king centralization.\n```\na2b3\n```"

This is a king and pawn endgame where precise king movement is crucial.\n2. White's e-pawn is more advanced but currently blocked by Black's king.\n3. Black's a-pawn is the main counterplay and needs to be advanced carefully.\n4. The kings are quite far apart, which is important for calculating pawn races.\nCandidate moves for Black:\n1. a6a5 - advancing the pawn\n2. Various king moves (b3c4, b3b4, etc.)\nEvaluation:\n- Advancing the a-pawn (a6a5) seems most logical to create counterplay.\n- If we don't advance the pawn, White can bring their king closer to support their e-pawn.\n- After a6a5, if White plays e5e6, we can respond with a5a4, creating a passed pawn race.\n- The king should stay close enough to support the a-pawn's advance while also being able to interfere with White's e-pawn if needed.\nOther king moves would either:\n- Not help our pawn advance (like moving away from it)\n- Or risk allowing White's king to get closer to the center\nThe most forcing and principled move is to advance our passed pawn immediately. This creates maximum counterplay and forces White to deal with our advancing pawn while also managing their own.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na6a5\n```"

The white pawn is very advanced (e6) and threatens to promote soon\n2. The black pawn is at a5 and can potentially promote as well\n3. The black king is closer to the white pawn than the white king is to the black pawn\n4. The white king is very far away on the g8 square\nEvaluation:\n- This is a race between the pawns\n- Black must stop the white pawn from promoting while advancing its own pawn\n- The black king is in a good position to intercept the white pawn\nCandidate moves:\n1. b3c4 - moves king closer to the white pawn\n2. a5a4 - advances the black pawn\n3. Other king moves that don't help as much\nAnalysis:\n- If we play a5a4 immediately, white can push e6e7 and our king is too far to stop it\n- We need to first position our king to stop the white pawn\n- b3c4 is the best move as it brings the king closer to the e6 pawn while still keeping options open for our own pawn push\nAfter b3c4:\n- White will likely push e6e7\n- Then we can play c4d5, getting closer to the pawn\n- Eventually we can capture the pawn or force white to waste time\nOther moves like b3b4 or b3a4 would leave our king too far from the action.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb3c4\n```"
