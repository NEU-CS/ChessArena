When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: King on b8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, g3, h2, rook on g8\n- White has: King on g2, pawns on a2, b2, rook on e1, rook on e8\n2. Key observations:\n- White has a rook on e8 which is very active\n- Black's rook on g8 is currently trapped by White's rook on e8\n- Black's pawn on h2 is one square away from promotion\n- White's king is exposed to checks from the h2 pawn\n3. The only legal move is g8e8 (rook takes rook):\n- This is a forced exchange\n- After the exchange, the position would be:\n  - Black king on b8\n  - White king on g2\n  - Black pawn on h2\n  - Other pieces remain but are less relevant\n4. After g8e8:\n- White must recapture with e1e8\n- Then Black can play h2h1q to promote the pawn to a queen\n- This leads to a winning endgame for Black as the queen can deliver checkmate or win material\n5. Alternative considerations:\n- There are no other legal moves available\n- Not taking the rook would be illegal\n- This is clearly the best and only path to victory\nThe move is forced and leads to a winning position for Black. Here is the move:\n```\ng8e8\n```"
