When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully.\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a queen (Qb2), two rooks (Rg3, Rc1), and pawns (g2, h2)\n2. Black has a queen (Qc5), rook (Rd8), bishop (Bc6), and pawns (f7, g6, h7)\n3. Black's king is at g8, White's king at h1\n4. White has a material advantage (queen + 2 rooks vs queen + rook + bishop)\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat active but White has better coordination\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rg3g6 - attacking the pawn and pinning it to the king\n2. Qb2b8 - threatening to win the rook\n3. Qb2f6 - attacking the bishop and threatening mate\n4. Rc1c5 - exchanging queens\nLet me evaluate these:\n1. Rg3g6:\n   - Pins the g6 pawn to the king\n   - After ...hxg6, Qb2xg7# is mate\n   - So Black can't take the rook\n   - Black would likely play ...Qc5e5 to defend g7\n   - Then Qb2xe5 dxe5 and White is winning but not immediately decisive\n2. Qb2b8:\n   - Threatens the rook on d8\n   - Black can defend with ...Rd8d7\n   - Then Rc1c5 Qc5xc5 Qb8xc5 and White is up material but no immediate win\n3. Qb2f6:\n   - Attacks the bishop on c6\n   - Threatens Qf6g7#\n   - Black would have to play ...Bc6d5 blocking\n   - Then Rg3g6 is strong, maintaining pressure\n4. Rc1c5:\n   - Forces queen exchange\n   - Qc5xc5 Qb2xc5 and White is up material\n   - But this gives Black some counterplay with ...Bc6d5\nThe most forcing and decisive line appears to be Rg3g6, as it creates immediate threats that Black cannot adequately defend against. After Rg3g6, if Black tries to defend with ...Qc5e5, we have Qb2xe5 dxe5 Rc1c5, winning material decisively.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng3g6\n```"
