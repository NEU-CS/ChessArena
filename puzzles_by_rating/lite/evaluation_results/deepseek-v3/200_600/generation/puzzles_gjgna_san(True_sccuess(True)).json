When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 3 pawns\n- Black has: 2 Rooks, Queen, Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two bishops)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is on h2, somewhat exposed but defended by pawns\n- Black king is on g7, also somewhat exposed\n3. Piece activity:\n- White has a knight on g5 attacking f7\n- Black has a knight on f3 attacking h2\n- Black's bishop on e6 is very active\n- White's bishop on a2 is passive\n4. Immediate threats:\n- Black's knight on f3 is threatening mate on h2\n- White must deal with this threat immediately\nThe only legal move is Kh1, which:\n- Gets the king away from the immediate mate threat\n- Maintains the knight's attack on f7\n- Keeps the option of playing Qxf3 next move if Black doesn't defend\nWhile the position remains complicated, Kh1 is the only move that addresses the immediate threat. Other moves would be possible if they were legal, but they're not in this position.\n```\nKh1\n```"
