When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's bishop on e6 is very strong, attacking f7 and g8 squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has a rook on f2 attacking White's pawn on g2\n- White has doubled rooks on the d-file\n3. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is Rf2xg2\n- White has potential threats against Black's king\n4. Candidate moves:\na) e6g8 - Bishop sacrifice to expose the king\nb) d6d8 - Rook lift to attack the king\nc) h1g1 - Defending g2 pawn\nd) e6f7 - Bishop takes bishop\nLet me evaluate these:\na) e6g8 - After Bxg8 Rxg8, Rd8+ Rf8, Rxf8+ Kxf8, Rd8+ Ke7 - White has some pressure but material is equal. Not clearly winning.\nb) d6d8 - After Rd8, Black can play Rf1+ forcing Kg1, then Rxd1 Rxd1 and Black still has Rf2xg2 threat.\nc) h1g1 - Defends g2 but passive. Black can improve position.\nd) e6f7 - Bxf7 Rxf7, then Rd8+ Rf8, Rxf8+ Kxf8, Rd8+ Ke7 - similar to line a.\nThe most promising seems to be e6g8 sacrifice to expose the king. After:\n1. e6g8 Rxg8\n2. Rd8+ Rf8\n3. Rxf8+ Kxf8\n4. Rd8+ Ke7\n5. Rxa8 - White wins a pawn and has active rook vs Black's exposed king.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne6g8\n```"
