When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king, bishop, pawns on a5, b4, d4, e6, f5, g7, h7\n- White has: king, queen on b5, knight on e5, pawns on b3, f4, g2, h3, a2, c2\nMaterial is roughly equal (Black has bishop vs knight, but White's queen is very active).\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on b5, attacking b7 bishop and a5 pawn\n- Black's bishop is somewhat trapped on b7\n- Black's d4 pawn is passed but blockaded by White's knight\n- White has a passed pawn on f4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxb7 winning the bishop\n- White also has potential threats like Qd5+ or Nc6\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Bishop moves:\n- b7a6 - blocks queen's attack but leaves bishop passive\n- b7c8 - gets bishop to safety but still passive\n- b7d5 - active but Qxd5 loses the bishop\nb) King moves:\n- g8h8 - safer but still exposed\n- g8f8 - centralizes king but still exposed\nc) Pawn moves:\n- d4d3 - advances passed pawn but Nxd3\n- a5a4 - creates passed pawn but bxa4 and Qxa4\nd) Other:\n- d4e3 - trades pawns but opens f-file for White's rook if promoted\nAfter careful consideration, the best move seems to be b7a6. This:\n- Saves the bishop from immediate capture\n- Maintains control over c8 square\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n- Keeps options open for future bishop redeployment\nOther options either lose material or create bigger weaknesses. The king moves don't solve the immediate threat to the bishop.\n```\nb7a6\n```"
