When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Here's the board situation:\nWhite has:\n- Queen on a8\n- Rook on b1\n- Pawns on a2, g2, h2\n- Knight on g2\n- King on h1\nBlack has:\n- Queen on b2\n- Rook on c4\n- Knight on g4\n- Pawns on a6, c6, c7, e6, e7, f7\n- King on f7\nKey observations:\n1. Black's queen is attacking our rook on b1\n2. Black's knight on g4 is threatening to fork our king and rook with Ne3+\n3. Our queen is somewhat trapped on a8 with limited mobility\n4. Black has a passed pawn on e6 that could become dangerous\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b1b2 - capturing the queen, but after Qxb2 we lose material (rook for queen)\n2. h2g4 - capturing the knight, but after fxg4 we're still in trouble\n3. a8b7 - moving the queen to attack the pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n4. b1c1 - moving the rook away from attack while keeping pressure on c-file\n5. h1g1 - moving the king to safety\nAfter careful consideration:\n- b1c1 seems best as it saves the rook while maintaining some control of the c-file\n- It prevents immediate material loss\n- It keeps options open for future counterplay\n- Other moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb1c1\n```"
