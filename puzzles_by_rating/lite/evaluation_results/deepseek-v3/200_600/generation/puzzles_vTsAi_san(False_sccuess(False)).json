When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a bishop on f3 attacking our rook on d1 and eyeing the g2 pawn\n3. Our bishop on e2 is pinned to the king by Black's queen on e7\n4. Black has pressure on the dark squares (f3 bishop, f6 knight)\n5. Our pawn structure is solid but needs active play\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) Defensive options:\n- e2f3 - trades the pinned bishop but leaves us with doubled pawns\n- g1h1 - moves king to safety but doesn't solve the pin\n- d1d2 - moves rook away but blocks the queen\nB) Active options:\n- c1h6 - develops bishop actively, threatens to weaken Black's kingside\n- d4d5 - pawn break to gain space and open lines\n- c4c5 - another pawn break but less forcing\nC) Tactical options:\n- g2f3 - pawn takes bishop, but after Qxf3 we lose material\n- c1e3 - develops bishop and defends f3 square\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c1h6 is very tempting as it develops with tempo (threatening h6)\n- However, Black can simply play g7g6 and we've achieved little\n- d4d5 is more principled, opening the position for our bishops\n- After d4d5, if exd5 we can recapture with cxd5 keeping the pawn structure\n- This also opens the c-file for our rooks\nThe best move is:\n```\nd4d5\n```"
