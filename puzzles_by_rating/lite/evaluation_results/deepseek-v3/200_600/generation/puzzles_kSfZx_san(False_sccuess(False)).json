When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed on g7 with pawn weaknesses around it\n3. White's bishop on h5 is very active, eyeing the f7 square\n4. Black has a strong knight on d7 controlling key squares\n5. White has a space advantage in the center\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- h5g6: Bishop sacrifice to open up Black's king\n- d1g4: Queen to an active square, eyeing g7\n- d2e4: Centralizing the knight\n- g1f3: Developing the knight to a natural square\nLet's evaluate h5g6:\nAfter fxg6, White can play Qg4 with strong threats against g6 and g7. Black would have to play Qg5 to defend, but then Nf3 would create more threats. This seems promising.\nd1g4 is also interesting, but Black can defend with Qg5 or Nf6.\nd2e4 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats.\ng1f3 is too slow when we have a chance to attack.\nAfter careful consideration, the bishop sacrifice h5g6 seems the most forcing and dangerous for Black. It opens up the king position and leads to a strong attack.\n```\nh5g6\n```"
