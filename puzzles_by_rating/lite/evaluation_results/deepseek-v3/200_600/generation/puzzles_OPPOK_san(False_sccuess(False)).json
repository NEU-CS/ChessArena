When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on h6\n- Black has a passed pawn on c2 that looks dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on b6\n- White's bishop controls important diagonals\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens to play c2c1=Q next move\n- White needs to deal with this threat while maintaining activity\n4. Candidate moves:\na) h6h8 - rook lift to 8th rank, but doesn't address c2 threat\nb) f3c6 - bishop sacrifice to expose black king: Kxc6 Rc8+ wins, but black can decline with Kb7\nc) h6g6 - rook moves to g-file with tempo, attacking g7 pawn\nd) f3h5 - bishop moves to h5, but doesn't help much\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f3c6 looks tempting but after Kb7, white still needs to deal with c2 threat\n- h6g6 is strong as it attacks g7 pawn and maintains rook's activity\n- After h6g6, if black plays c2c1=Q, white can play Rg6xg7 with strong counterplay\nThe best move is h6g6, putting immediate pressure on black's position while maintaining flexibility to deal with the c2 pawn threat.\n```\nh6g6\n```"
