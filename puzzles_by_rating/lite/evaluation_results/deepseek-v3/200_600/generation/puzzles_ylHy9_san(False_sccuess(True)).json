When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's b7 pawn is one square from promotion\n- Black's queen is attacking g2 pawn\n- White's queen is currently on a1\n- Black's rook is on e1, controlling the e-file\n- White's bishop on f3 is controlling important squares\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen can take g2 pawn (Qxg2+)\n- If Qxg2+, then Kxg2 allows Re1-e2+ winning the bishop\n- Black is threatening mate in 2: Qxg2+, Kxg2 Re2+, Kh3 Rh2#\n4. Possible moves:\n- Only legal move is a1e1 (Qa1-e1)\n- This pins the black rook to the king\n- After Qe1, if black takes Qxg2+, Kxg2 Re1xe1 and white is up material\n- Black might try Qd1+ instead, but white can respond Qe1\n5. Evaluation:\n- Qa1-e1 is forced but good\n- It prevents immediate mate threats\n- Maintains the b7 pawn's promotion threat\n- Pins the black rook which is currently very active\nThe move Qa1-e1 is the only legal move and it's actually quite strong, solving all immediate threats while maintaining white's advantages.\n```\na1e1\n```"
