When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: King, Queen, Knight, 2 pawns\n- Black has: King, 2 Rooks, Queen, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has Q+N vs Black's Q+R), but position is very sharp.\n2. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen is attacking our king (Qe1+ is threatened next move)\n- Black's rook on b8 is very active\n- Black's h3 pawn is close to promotion\n3. Available moves:\n- Qxe1: We take the queen but allow Qe1+ Kxe1 Rxe1# (checkmate)\n- Qc1: We defend against the immediate mate threat\n4. After Qc1:\n- Black can play Qe1+ Qxe1 Rxe1+ Kb2 (we survive)\n- Or Black might play something else like Rxb2, but we have Qc3+ to counter\n5. Calculating Qxe1:\n- Qxe1 Qe1+ Kb2 (only move) Rxb2+ Ka3 (forced) Rb3+ Ka4 Rxa2+ Kb4 Rb2+ Ka3 Rb3+ is perpetual check\n- But Black might have better with Qe1+ Kb2 Rxb2+ Ka3 Rb3+ Ka4 Qa1#\nConclusion: Qxe1 leads to forced mate or perpetual check, while Qc1 allows us to survive. Qc1 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose.\n```\nQc1\n```"
