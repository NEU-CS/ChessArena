When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king, rook, bishop, knight, queen (total ~17 points)\n- White has: king, rook, queen, knight, pawn (total ~19 points)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but position is very sharp.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White has a rook on e8 attacking the bishop on d6\n- White's queen on g6 is very active\n- Black's queen on b4 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Black has a knight on d4 that's well placed\n3. The only legal move is h8e8 - rook takes rook:\n- This is a forced recapture since White's rook is attacking Black's bishop\n- After h8e8, White can play Qxe8+ winning the exchange (queen takes rook)\n- However, Black would then have Qxf3, winning White's knight\n- The resulting position would be roughly equal material but Black's pieces would be more active\n4. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves - all other pieces are pinned or would leave the king in check\n- The bishop on d6 is pinned to the king by the rook on e8\n- The queen cannot move without exposing the king\n- The knight cannot move without exposing the king to discovered checks\n5. Evaluation:\n- This is the only possible move\n- The resulting position after exchanges should be roughly equal\n- Black maintains some initiative due to active pieces\nGiven that this is the only legal move and it leads to a roughly equal position, I'll play:\n```\nh8e8\n```"
