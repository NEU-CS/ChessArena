If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black has a passed pawn on c6, while White has connected passed pawns on b4 and c5.\n2. Key features:\n   - Black's rook is actively placed on e5, controlling the e-file and eyeing White's pawns.\n   - White's rook on d1 is somewhat passive but controls the d-file.\n   - White's king is slightly exposed on g1.\n   - Black's king is safe on g8.\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Rxc5: Capturing the pawn immediately, but after bxc5, White's a-pawn becomes dangerous.\n   - Re4: Putting pressure on White's b4 pawn.\n   - Re1+: Checking the king to gain time.\n   - Kf8: Improving king safety.\n4. Best move seems to be Re1+:\n   - Forces White's king to move (either Kh2 or Kf1)\n   - After Kh2, we can play Re4 attacking the b4 pawn\n   - After Kf1, we can consider Rxc5 as the king is further away from the queenside\n   - This gains time and maintains our active rook position\n5. Other moves like Rxc5 are premature as they release the pressure and allow White's pawns to advance.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRe1+\n```"
