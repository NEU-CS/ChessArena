When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Bishop, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Queen, pawn on h7, pawn on a6, pawn on b5, pawn on c4\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a strong attacking position.\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on h1\n- Black king is on g6, somewhat exposed but defended by pawn on h6\n3. Threats:\n- Black's queen on d1 is threatening mate in 1 with Qd1h1#\n- White must address this immediate threat first\n4. Available moves:\n- e7e1: Rook moves to e1, blocking the queen's path to h1\n- f6f1: Queen moves to f1, also blocking the queen's path to h1\n5. Evaluation of moves:\n- e7e1: \n  - Blocks the mate threat\n  - Rook is more valuable than queen for blocking\n  - Leaves queen active on f6\n  - After Qxe1, Qxe1 would win the rook but lose the queen\n- f6f1:\n  - Blocks with the queen\n  - Less material loss if Black takes (Qxf1, Rxf1)\n  - But leaves rook on e7 which could be useful later\n6. Best move:\nf6f1 is better because:\n- It maintains the rook's activity on e7\n- If Black takes Qxf1, Rxf1 leaves White with rook vs pawns\n- The rook on e7 can still be useful in the endgame\n- It's more economical to sacrifice the queen than the rook\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf6f1\n```"
