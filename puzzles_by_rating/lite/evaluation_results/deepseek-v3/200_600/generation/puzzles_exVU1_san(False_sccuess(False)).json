When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Black has a king and pawn, White has a king and knight. Material is equal (though knight vs pawn is usually slightly better for the knight).\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is active and centralized\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n- Black's pawn on d5 is passed but blockaded by the knight\n- White's knight is well-placed on d3 controlling key squares\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c4b5: King moves toward the pawn but might be too slow\n- c4d4: Centralizes the king more but allows White counterplay\n- c4d3: Captures the knight but loses the pawn after Kxd3\n- c4c3: Keeps pressure but doesn't make progress\n- c4b3: Similar to c3 but less central\n- d5d4: Advances the passed pawn\n4. Evaluation:\nThe best move is d5d4, advancing the passed pawn. This:\n- Creates immediate threats\n- Forces White to deal with the pawn\n- Maintains the blockade on d3\n- If White takes with Nxd4, then Kxd4 and we have a drawn king vs king endgame\n- If White doesn't take, the pawn can advance further\nOther moves either don't make progress or allow White counterplay. Advancing the pawn is the most active and principled move.\n```\nd5d4\n```"
