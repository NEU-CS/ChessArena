If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

However, White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's bishop pair is somewhat restricted\n- White's rook is very active on b-file\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxb8: Trading rook for bishop, but this would leave White with bishop vs bishop and passed pawn\n- Rb7: Pressuring the f7 pawn and potentially preparing to double on the 7th rank\n- Bd4: Centralizing the bishop and eyeing the weak f6 square\n- c6: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rxb8 Bxb8 leaves White with bishop vs bishop and passed pawn, but Black can defend\n- Rb7 is strong, threatening to win the f7 pawn after Bxf7+\n- Bd4 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- c6 is interesting but allows Black counterplay with ...Bc7\nThe most forcing and promising move is Rb7, which:\n1) Attacks the f7 pawn\n2) Prepares to double on the 7th rank\n3) Maintains pressure on the b-file\n4) Creates potential threats against Black's king\nBlack's best response would likely be ...Bc7 to defend f7, but then White can follow up with Bxf7+! Kxf7 Rxc7 winning material.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRb7\n```"
