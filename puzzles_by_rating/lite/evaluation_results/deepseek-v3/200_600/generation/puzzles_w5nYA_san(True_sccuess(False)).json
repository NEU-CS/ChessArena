When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black has a bishop on g4 pinning our knight on f3 (if we had one), but currently we don't have a knight there\n3. Our dark-squared bishop is very active on d4\n4. Black's king is still in the center (c8)\n5. Black's bishop on g4 is unprotected and could be a target\n6. Our pawn structure is solid with pawns on c3, b2, a2, etc.\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) Bxg7 - wins a pawn but after Rxg7, Black gets open g-file and our bishop pair is gone\nB) Bxc5 - wins a pawn but after dxc5, we lose our strong bishop\nC) Be5 - centralizes the bishop and threatens Bxg7 next move\nD) h3 - challenges the bishop on g4\nE) g3 - blocks the bishop's diagonal but weakens dark squares\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Be5 seems most promising as it maintains pressure and threatens to win the g7 pawn next move while keeping our strong bishop\n- h3 is also interesting but less forcing\n- Bxg7 is tempting but gives up the bishop pair unnecessarily\nThe best move is:\n```\nBe5\n```"
