If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, R, B, pawns\n- Black has: q, r, r, b, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a more active position.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on h5, eyeing the black king.\n- White has doubled rooks on the c-file, with one already on c6.\n- Black has a rook on f1 pinning White's rook on c1 to the king.\n- Black's queen on d6 is defending the rook on f1.\n3. Candidate moves:\na) Bg1 - This would unpin the rook on c1 by blocking the pin, but it seems passive.\nb) Rxf1 - Taking the rook immediately. Let's calculate this:\n   - After Rxf1, Qxf1 is forced (since the queen defends f1)\n   - Then we can play Qxf1, winning the queen for rook\n   - But we need to see if this leads to any immediate threats\n4. Calculating Rxf1:\n- 31. Rxf1 Qxf1\n- 32. Qxf1 Rxf1\n- 33. Rc8+ Bf8\n- 34. Rxf8# (checkmate)\nThis is a forced mate in 4 moves! The key is that after the rook exchange, White can deliver a deadly discovered check with Rc8+, leading to mate.\nThe alternative Bg1 would just prolong the game without any immediate winning chances. The rook capture leads directly to mate.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxf1\n```"
