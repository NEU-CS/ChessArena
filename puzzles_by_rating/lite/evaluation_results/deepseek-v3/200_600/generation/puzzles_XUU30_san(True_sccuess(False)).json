When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze this position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has Q+N vs White's Q+B). The pawn structure is roughly balanced.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7, while White's king is safer on g1.\n3. Key features:\n   - White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous if advanced.\n   - Black's queen is very active in the center.\n   - White's bishop on e5 is strong, controlling important squares.\n   - Black's knight on d5 is well-placed but could be challenged.\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Qf5: Attacks the bishop and maintains central control\n   - Qe6: Defends the knight and keeps pressure\n   - Nf6: Develops the knight to a more active square\n   - g6: Solidifies the king's position but weakens dark squares\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- Qf5 looks tempting as it attacks the bishop, but after Bf4 White maintains control.\n- Nf6 allows White to play Qg4 with pressure.\n- g6 weakens the dark squares around the king.\n- Qe6 seems most solid, defending the knight while maintaining flexibility.\nThe best move appears to be Qe6, as it:\n- Defends the knight on d5\n- Maintains central control\n- Keeps options open for future play\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n```\nQe6\n```"
