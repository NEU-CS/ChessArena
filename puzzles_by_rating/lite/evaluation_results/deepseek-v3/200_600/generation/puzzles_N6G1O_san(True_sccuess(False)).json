If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White: Queen, Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns\n- Black: Queen, Bishop, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on b1\n- Black king is exposed on c3 but has some pawn cover\n3. Key features:\n- Black's king is in a very vulnerable position on c3\n- White has multiple checks available\n- Black's queen is very active on b6\n- White's rook is already on h4, eyeing the f4 bishop\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qc5+: This forces the king to move (Kb2 or Kd3) and opens up discovery possibilities\n- Rxf4: Eliminating the dangerous bishop and gaining material\n- Qxf6+: Winning a pawn but allowing Black counterplay\n- Qb4+: Forcing the king to d3 where it might be more exposed\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qc5+ is very strong as it forces the king to move and opens up potential discoveries\n- After Qc5+ Kb2 (best), White can play Qb4+ forcing Kc2, then Rc4+ winning the queen\n- Rxf4 is also good but less forcing - Black could play Qb1+ with counterplay\nThe most forcing and winning line is Qc5+, so I'll play that.\n```\nQc5+\n```"
