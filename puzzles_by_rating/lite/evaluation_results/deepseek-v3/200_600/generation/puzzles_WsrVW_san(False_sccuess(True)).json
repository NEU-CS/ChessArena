When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal (Black has rook, bishop, pawns vs White's rook, bishop, pawns)\n2. Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n3. White has a passed h-pawn that's already on h5\n4. Black has doubled rooks on the a-file and a bishop on c4\n5. White's rook on g5 is attacking the f5 pawn\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f8g8 - Protecting the king\n2. c4a6 - Bishop retreat\n3. a2a4 - Advancing the a-pawn\n4. f7f5 - Countering the rook's attack\nDeeper analysis:\n- f8g8 seems passive but might be necessary to prevent back rank threats\n- c4a6 could be interesting to reposition the bishop\n- a2a4 looks tempting to create counterplay\n- f7f5 seems risky as it opens the position when Black's king is exposed\nLooking at threats:\n- White has potential threats like Rg5-g8+ or h5-h6\n- Black needs to both defend and create counterplay\nBest move seems to be f8g8, securing the king first. This prevents any immediate back rank issues and maintains coordination between the rooks. After this, Black can think about advancing the a-pawn or repositioning the bishop.\n```\nf8g8\n```"
