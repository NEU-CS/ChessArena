If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Black's king is exposed on g7 with pawn weaknesses around it\n3. White has a bishop on h5 that's very active\n4. Black has a strong knight on d7 controlling key squares\n5. The center is semi-open with pawns on d4 vs d5\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) Bxg6 - This seems tempting to exploit the exposed king, but after fxg6, White doesn't have immediate follow-up threats and loses the bishop pair.\nB) Ne4 - Centralizing the knight and threatening to jump to f6 or d6. Black could play dxe4 or Nxe4, but both lead to complications favoring White.\nC) dxe5 - Opening the d-file for the rook, but after Nxe5, Black's pieces become more active.\nD) Qg4 - Direct attack on g6, but Black can defend with Qxg4 or f5.\nAfter careful consideration, Ne4 seems strongest because:\n1) It improves White's worst-placed piece\n2) Creates threats against f6 and d6\n3) If Black takes dxe4, Bxg6 becomes stronger with the f-file open\n4) If Black plays Nxe4, we have Qg4 with strong attacking chances\n5) Maintains all of White's positional advantages\nThe move Ne4 also fits well with White's space advantage and potential kingside attack.\n```\nNe4\n```"
