When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong central presence with pawns on d4 and e4, supported by pieces\n3. Black's bishop on f6 is pinned to the king by White's queen on e4\n4. Black's king is safely castled but White has potential to build an attack\n5. Black's rooks are not connected yet\nKey observations:\n- The pin on f6 is problematic and should be addressed\n- Black needs to complete development and connect rooks\n- Counterplay options include ...c5 to challenge White's center or ...e5 to free the bishop\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. ...f6e7 - unpinning the bishop but blocks the e-file\n2. ...d8e7 - connects rooks but leaves f6 pinned\n3. ...c6c5 - challenges the center immediately\n4. ...a8b8 - prepares to connect rooks via b7\nAfter careful consideration:\n- ...c6c5 is the most principled move, challenging White's center and opening lines for Black's pieces\n- It also maintains the pin on the f3 knight\n- After dxc5, Black can recapture with ...b6xc5 with active play\nThe best move is:\n```\nc6c5\n```"
