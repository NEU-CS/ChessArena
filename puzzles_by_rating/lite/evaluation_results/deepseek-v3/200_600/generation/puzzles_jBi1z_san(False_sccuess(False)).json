When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, 2 rooks, minor pieces, pawns). White has a centralized queen on e5 and active pieces.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen is very active on e5, attacking multiple squares\n- Black's queen on b7 is somewhat exposed\n- Black's king is still on g7, not fully secured\n- White has a space advantage with the h4 pawn\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5b8: Queen sacrifice to win the rook, but after Qxb8 Rxb8, it's unclear if White has enough compensation\n- e5c7: Attacking the queen and threatening to win the b5 pawn\n- e5f6: Forcing the exchange of queens, but this may relieve pressure\n- c3d5: Centralizing the knight with threats on f6 and b6\n4. Best options:\n- e5c7 looks very strong, as after Qxc7 Nxc7, White wins the b5 pawn and maintains pressure\n- c3d5 is also interesting, eyeing f6 and b6 squares while increasing piece activity\nAfter deeper calculation:\n- e5c7 Qxc7 Nxc7 wins a pawn (b5 is hanging)\n- Black can try to defend with ...Rfc8, but after Nxb5, White is up a clean pawn\n- Other queen moves either don't win material or reduce pressure\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the pawn with the queen:\n```\ne5c7\n```"
