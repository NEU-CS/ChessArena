When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with White's queen on f7 controlling key squares.\n- White's king is relatively safe on g1.\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White's queen on f7 is attacking the rook on e8 and threatening mate on g7.\n- The h6 queen is also under attack by White's pawn on g2.\n4. Available move:\n- Only e8f8 is legal, moving the rook away from attack.\nEvaluation:\n- e8f8 is forced as the rook must move from attack.\n- After e8f8, White can play Qxg7# if not careful, but Black's queen on h6 controls g7.\n- However, White can play Qxf8+ next move, winning the rook.\n- The position is lost for Black as White has a decisive material advantage after Qxf8+.\nBut since e8f8 is the only legal move, we must play it:\n```\ne8f8\n```"
