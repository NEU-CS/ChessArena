When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal (king + pawn each)\n2. White's pawn is further advanced (h4 vs a6/b5)\n3. Black's king is more active (centralized)\n4. White's king is near the h-pawn but not protecting it directly\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b4c5 - centralizing king, attacking h4 pawn\n2. b4a5 - moving towards a6 pawn\n3. a6a5 - pushing the a-pawn\nOther moves seem less promising as they either retreat the king or don't make progress.\nAnalysis:\n- b4c5 looks strong as it threatens to capture h4 next move (Kxh4)\n- After b4c5, if white defends with Kh5, we can play c5d4 cutting off the king\n- a6a5 is also interesting to create a passed pawn, but gives white time to push h5\n- b4a5 seems too slow and doesn't create immediate threats\nThe most forcing and active move is b4c5, putting immediate pressure on the h4 pawn while centralizing the king. This maintains maximum activity and creates the most problems for white.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb4c5\n```"
