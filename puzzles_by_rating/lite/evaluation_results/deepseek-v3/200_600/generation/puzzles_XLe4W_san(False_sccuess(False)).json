When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong pawn center with d4 pawn\n4. Black's dark-squared bishop is very active on g4, pinning the f3 knight\n5. White's queen on d3 is well placed, eyeing the h7 square\n6. Black's king is safely castled but the rook on f8 is tied to defending the f7 pawn\nKey observations:\n- The pin on the f3 knight is very annoying for White\n- Black should maintain pressure and look to exploit the pin\n- The bishop on g4 is a key attacker, so we should avoid exchanging it unnecessarily\n- The d5 pawn is backward and potentially weak\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g4h3 - maintains the pin, forces White to deal with it\n2. g4f5 - attacks the center but may be premature\n3. d8d7 - connects rooks but seems passive\n4. f6e5 - central break but gives up the bishop pair\n5. c6e5 - knight jump, but allows d4xe5 improving White's structure\nAfter careful consideration, g4h3 seems most promising:\n- Maintains the pin on the knight\n- If White plays Qe2 to break the pin, we can consider f5 or other moves\n- If White plays h3, we can take the knight (h3xg4) and after hxg4, we've weakened White's kingside\n- Keeps all our pieces active and maintains pressure\nOther moves either release the pressure or don't improve our position as much.\n```\ng4h3\n```"
