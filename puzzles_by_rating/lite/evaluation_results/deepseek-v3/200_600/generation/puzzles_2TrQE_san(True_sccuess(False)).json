If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material: Black has a king and 2 pawns (a6, b5). White has a king and a pawn (h4). Black is up a pawn, which is a significant advantage in this endgame.\n2. King position: Black's king is on b4, White's king is on g5. The white king is more active and closer to the pawns.\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - Black's a-pawn is on a6, b-pawn on b5\n   - White's h-pawn is on h4\n   - The b-pawn is passed but blocked by White's king\n   - The a-pawn can advance but needs support\n4. Key considerations:\n   - Black needs to advance the a-pawn while keeping the king close enough to support it\n   - White's king is trying to stop both pawns\n   - The h-pawn is not an immediate threat as it's far away\n5. Candidate moves:\n   - a5: Immediately advances the pawn, but may be premature without king support\n   - Kc5: Centralizes the king but moves away from the a-pawn\n   - Ka5: Gets closer to the a-pawn but may be too passive\n   - Kc4: Better centralization while still being able to support pawns\n   - Kb3: Too passive and moves away from the action\n6. Best move analysis:\n   - Kc4 is strong as it centralizes the king while maintaining flexibility\n   - From c4, the king can support both pawn advances\n   - It prevents White's king from getting to c3 to blockade\n   - It keeps options open to go to b3 or d3 as needed\n7. Why not other moves:\n   - a5 immediately allows White's king to blockade with Kf4-e4-d4-c4-b4\n   - Kc5 moves too far from the a-pawn\n   - Ka5 is too passive and allows White's king more activity\nThe best move is:\n```\nKc4\n```"
