When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong central presence with pawn on e4 and bishops on d3/d4\n3. Black's king is exposed on the g8 square with the rook on f8\n4. White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 pawn and potentially the king\n5. Black's knight on f6 is under pressure from the bishop on d4\nKey observations:\n- White has threats like Bxh6 or Qg5, putting pressure on the kingside\n- Black needs to address the immediate threats while developing counterplay\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f6h5 - attacks the queen but allows Bxh6\n2. f6d7 - retreats the knight but blocks the queen\n3. g7g6 - defends against Bxh6 but weakens dark squares\n4. d6d5 - challenges the center but opens lines\n5. f8e8 - connects rooks and defends e7\nBest choice seems to be g7g6:\n- Prevents Bxh6 which would be dangerous\n- Maintains the knight's defense of h7\n- Keeps options open for the knight\n- The weakening of dark squares is manageable since White's dark-squared bishop is already on d4\nOther moves have more drawbacks:\n- f6h5 allows Bxh6 gxh6 Qg6+ with a strong attack\n- f6d7 blocks the queen and makes the position passive\n- d6d5 opens the position when we're not fully developed\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng7g6\n```"
