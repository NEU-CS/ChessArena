When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is on b4, very exposed\n- White has a rook on c3 and d1, controlling files\n- Black has a bishop on d5 and rook on g2\n- Black has pawn weaknesses on a6, b7, f7, h7\n3. Threats:\n- Black's rook on g2 is threatening White's h2 pawn\n- Black's bishop controls important squares\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxd5: Removing the strong bishop, but after ...Rxd5 White's knight can fork\n- Rb3+: Forcing the black king to move\n- Rc4+: Also forcing the black king\n- Nd6: Attacking the bishop and preparing to jump into c4\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rxd5 seems tempting but after ...Rxd5 Nc7+ Kc5 Nxd5 Kxd5, the position simplifies too much\n- Rb3+ forces the king to a4 or a5, but doesn't immediately win material\n- Rc4+ is more forcing as it attacks the king and threatens to win the bishop next move\nThe best move is Rc4+, which:\n1) Checks the king, forcing it to move\n2) Attacks the bishop on d5\n3) Maintains control of the c-file\n4) Prepares potential discovered checks with the knight\nBlack's king will have to move to a5 (a4 allows Rxd5 with check), after which we can consider moves like Rxd5 or Nd6 with strong threats.\n```\nRc4+\n```"
