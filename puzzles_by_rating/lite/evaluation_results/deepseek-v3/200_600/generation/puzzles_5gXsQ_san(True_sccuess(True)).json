When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (c8), Rook (c1), Queen (c2), Bishop (e1), 2 pawns (a6, g2), King (h1)\n- Black has: King (b8), Rook (d8), Rook (d7), Bishop (a7), Queen (d4), 3 pawns (f7, g5, e4)\n2. Key observations:\n- White's rook on c8 is attacking Black's king\n- Black's queen is very active on d4\n- White has doubled rooks on the c-file\n- Black has a passed e-pawn that could be dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n3. The only legal move is Rxc8, which seems forced:\n- If Black doesn't take the rook, White can play Rxd8+ next move\n- After Rxc8, White can respond with Rxc8+ Kxc8\n- Then the position would be roughly equal material, but Black's queen is very active\n4. Evaluation:\n- This is a forced sequence that leads to simplification\n- Black's queen activity compensates for the material imbalance\n- The position remains complex with chances for both sides\nSince Rxc8 is the only legal move and leads to a playable position, I'll play:\n```\nRxc8\n```"
