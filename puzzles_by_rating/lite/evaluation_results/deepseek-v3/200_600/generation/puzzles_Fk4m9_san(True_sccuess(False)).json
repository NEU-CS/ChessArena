When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White is up a minor piece (Bishop vs nothing).\n2. King safety: Black's king is very exposed on b6, while White's king is safe on g1.\n3. Key features:\n   - Black's rook on a4 is active but not immediately threatening\n   - White has strong central control with pawns on e5 and pieces well-placed\n   - Black's pawn structure has weaknesses (c5, e6 pawns)\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Rb7+ forces the king to move and wins material\n   - Rxe6+ is tempting but allows Kc7 and Black might survive\n   - Bxc5+ wins a pawn but might not be the most forcing\n   - Nc7 forks king and rook but allows Ka6\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rb7+ is the most forcing move, as after Kxb7 Nxc5+ wins the rook on a4 with a decisive material advantage\n- Other moves either don't maximize the advantage or give Black counterplay\nThe most crushing continuation is:\n```\nRb7+\n```\nAfter Kxb7 Nxc5+ wins the rook, leaving White with an overwhelming material advantage."
