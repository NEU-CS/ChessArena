When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, 2 pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, knight, 3 pawns\n- Black is up a knight and pawn, but White has active pieces\n2. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on h1\n- Black king is on h7, also exposed but defended by queen\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's knight on f2 is attacking White's rook on f1\n- Black's queen on e7 is eyeing the g5 square\n- White's queen on g4 is very active\n4. Candidate moves:\na) h1g1 - moves king away from potential checks\n   - Protects the rook\n   - But allows Black to play Qg5+ with tempo\n   - After Qg5+, White would have to move queen or block\nb) f1f2 - rook takes knight\n   - Removes the attacking knight\n   - But allows Qg5+ winning the rook back after Kh1\n   - After f1f2 Qg5+ Kh1 Qxf2, White is down material\nBetween these two options, h1g1 seems better as it maintains material equality for now and keeps the rook active. After h1g1, if Black plays Qg5+, White can respond with Qxg5 hxg5, leading to an endgame where White has rook vs rook and pawns, which might be holdable.\nThe alternative f1f2 leads to immediate material loss after the queen check.\nTherefore, the better move is:\n```\nh1g1\n```"
