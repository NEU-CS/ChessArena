When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on d4 is very active, eyeing the weak f6 square and potentially threatening to invade on the dark squares.\n- Black's king is still in the center (castled kingside but f8 rook hasn't connected).\n- Black's light-squared bishop is passive on c8.\n- White has pressure along the d-file with the rook on d3.\n3. Threats:\n- White could potentially play Qf6 or Qh4, creating threats against the king.\n- White might want to double rooks on the d-file.\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8e8: Connecting rooks and getting the king's rook into play\n- c6d5: Challenging White's strong queen\n- e7f6: Blocking potential Qf6 ideas while developing the bishop\n- b8d7: Developing the knight with tempo on the queen\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f8e8 looks solid but doesn't address the queen pressure\n- c6d5 allows Qxd5 exd5 when White gets strong central control\n- e7f6 is too passive and blocks the f-pawn\n- b8d7 seems most active, developing with tempo and preparing to bring the rook to d8\nThe best move appears to be b8d7, developing the knight and preparing to challenge White's control of the d-file. After Q moves, we can play Rd8 with counterplay.\n```\nb8d7\n```"
