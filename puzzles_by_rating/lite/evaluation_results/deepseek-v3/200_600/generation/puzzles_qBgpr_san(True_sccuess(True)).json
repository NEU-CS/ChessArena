If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Looking at the board:\n   - White has a queen on g6 attacking the g7 pawn\n   - Black's only legal move is hxg6, capturing the queen with the h-pawn\n3. Evaluating the position after hxg6:\n   - White's queen is off the board, which is good for Black\n   - Black gains a queen for a pawn (material advantage)\n   - The position becomes more balanced after this exchange\n4. Other considerations:\n   - There are no other legal moves available\n   - Not taking the queen would be a blunder\n   - The move is forced but favorable for Black\nSince this is the only legal move and it's clearly advantageous for Black (winning the queen), this is the move to play. \n```\nhxg6\n```"
