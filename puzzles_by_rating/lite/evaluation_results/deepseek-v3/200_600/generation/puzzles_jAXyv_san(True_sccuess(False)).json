If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

White has a space advantage with pawns on a4 and d4\n3. White's pieces are more active - bishop on a3 is strong, queen on c2 is well-placed\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced on f5 and h7\n5. Black's knight on f6 is under pressure from g4 pawn and h4 pawn\nKey considerations:\n- White is threatening to play g5, kicking the knight and gaining more space\n- Black needs to either defend the knight or find counterplay\n- The h6 square looks weak and could be exploited by White's queen\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qh6 - immediately challenges White's attack, but after g5 Qxh4, White gets strong play with Nxf5\n2. Nh6 - defends against g5 but leaves the knight awkwardly placed\n3. Kh8 - removes king from potential checks but doesn't address the knight issue\n4. Ng5 - counterattacks the h4 pawn, but after hxg5 Qxh4, White has strong play\n5. Qg6 - defends the knight and prepares to double on the g-file\nAfter careful consideration, Qg6 seems the most resilient:\n- It defends the knight on f6\n- Prepares potential ...Rg8 with kingside pressure\n- Maintains flexibility for future plans\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\nThe alternatives either create tactical problems or leave the knight vulnerable. Qg6 maintains the balance while keeping all options open.\n```\nQg6\n```"
