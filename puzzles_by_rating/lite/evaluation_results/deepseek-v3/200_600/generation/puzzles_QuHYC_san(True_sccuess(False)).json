When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has 2 rooks, bishop and 2 pawns vs Black's rook and king. White is clearly winning in material.\n2. King safety: White's king is somewhat exposed but Black has no immediate threats. Black's king is on a6 which is vulnerable.\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on a3 and f4 which can be advanced. Black has no pawns.\n4. Piece activity: White's rooks and bishop are very active. Black's rook on e8 is passive.\nKey ideas:\n- We should look to coordinate our pieces to create mating threats\n- The f-pawn can be advanced to create more space\n- We can consider checks to force Black's king into worse positions\nLooking at the candidate moves:\n- Rb6+ looks tempting as it forces the king to move (Ka7 or Ka5)\n- If Ka7, we can follow up with Rc7+ winning the rook\n- If Ka5, we can play Rc5+ winning the king\n- Other rook moves don't create immediate threats\n- Bishop moves don't seem as forcing\n- Pawn moves can wait\nAfter Rb6+ Ka7 Rc7+, Black is forced to play Rxc7 and we recapture with bxc7, then our passed pawns should win easily.\nTherefore, the most forcing and decisive move is:\n```\nRb6+\n```"
