When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black is up a knight but White has active pieces.\n2. The immediate threats:\n- Black's knight on f2 is attacking White's rook on f1\n- Black's queen on e7 could potentially create threats if given time\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Kg1: This would move the king away from potential checks, but leaves the rook hanging to the knight\n- Rxf2: This captures the knight, but we need to calculate the consequences\n4. Analyzing Rxf2:\n- After Rxf2, Black can play Qe1+ forcing White's king to h2 (only legal move)\n- Then Black can play Qxf1, winning the rook back\n- Final material would be White queen vs Black queen and rook - losing for White\n5. Analyzing Kg1:\n- After Kg1, Black can play Nxd1 (capturing the rook)\n- But then White has Qh5+! Kg8 Qe8+ Rxe8 Rxe8# - a forced checkmate!\nTherefore, Kg1 is the winning move as it sets up a forced checkmate sequence. The initial sacrifice of the rook leads to mate.\n```\nKg1\n```"
