When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a bishop on d4 that's very active, but Black has a bishop on g4 pinning the knight on f3 (though f3 is currently empty in this position)\n3. Black's king is still in the center (c8) which could be a target\n4. White has the two bishops, which is a long-term advantage\n5. Black's bishop on g4 is unprotected and could be a tactical target\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) d4g7 - This looks tempting as it wins the exchange (bishop for rook), but after ...Kxg7, White doesn't have immediate follow-up and Black's king becomes safer.\nB) d4f6 - Attacks the bishop on g4 while developing a threat. After ...Bxf6, White can play Qd5+ forking king and bishop.\nC) h2h3 - This could be a useful preparatory move to kick the bishop, but it's a bit slow.\nD) f1b5 - Developing the bishop with tempo against the black queen.\nThe most promising seems to be d4f6, which leads to a favorable sequence:\n1. d4f6 Bg4xf6\n2. Qd1d5+ Kc8b8 (only move)\n3. Qd5xf7 winning a pawn and maintaining pressure\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd4f6\n```"
