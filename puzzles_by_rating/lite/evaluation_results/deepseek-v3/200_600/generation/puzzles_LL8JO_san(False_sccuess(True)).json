When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (a8), Queen (d8), Rook (f8), Knight (e6), Bishop (e4), pawns (b6, d6, e5, f7, g6, a5)\n- White has: Rook (a1), Knight (e7), Queen (h7), Rook (f3), Bishop (e2), pawns (a2, b3, c4, f6, g2, h2)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with White's queen on h7\n- White has a strong knight on e7 threatening multiple squares\n- Black's bishop on e4 is very active\n- White's pawn on f6 is passed and dangerous\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White has Qxh8# if Black doesn't defend\n- The only legal move is h8h7 (king moves to h7)\n4. After h8h7:\n- White can play Qxh7# (queen takes king)\n- Or if White doesn't take immediately, Black's position is still extremely dangerous with multiple threats\n5. Evaluation:\n- This is a forced mate in 1 for White after any Black move\n- The given move h8h7 allows Qxh7#\n- There are no other legal moves for Black\nSince the position is completely lost and any move leads to immediate checkmate, I'll make the only legal move available:\n```\nh8h7\n```"
