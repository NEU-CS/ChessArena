If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has minor piece advantage, Black has pawn advantage)\n2. Key features:\n- White's pieces are very active (Rook on d6, Bishop on a6, Knight on b5)\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White has threats like Qxf5 or Qe4+\n- Black's queen is under attack from the Rook on d6\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxd6: Seems tempting but after Rxd6, White has strong pressure\n- Qe8: Defends against Qe4+ but doesn't solve other problems\n- Re7: Defends the f7 pawn and connects rooks\n- Ka8: Gets the king away from potential checks\n- Qd5: Counterattacks the knight while defending the queen\n4. Best move analysis:\n- Qxd6 is too risky as it gives up the queen for rook and bishop\n- Re7 looks solid but allows White to play Qe4+ anyway\n- Ka8 is passive and doesn't address the immediate threats\n- Qd5 is the most active response, counterattacking the knight while maintaining the queen's defense\nAfter Qd5, if White takes with Nxd5, then Rxd6 and Black has rook vs bishop+knight which is roughly equal. If White doesn't take, Black maintains the queen's activity.\nThe move Qd5 also prevents Qe4+ and keeps options open for counterplay.\n```\nQd5\n```"
