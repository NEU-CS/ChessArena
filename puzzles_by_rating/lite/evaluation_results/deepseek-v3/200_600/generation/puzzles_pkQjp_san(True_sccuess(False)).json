If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Black's king is on h8, white's king is on h3\n3. Black has a rook on e8 and pawns on a6, c5, g7, h6\n4. White has a queen on e6, rook on d7, pawns on a2, c3, g6, h2\n5. White's g6 pawn is threatening to promote soon\nBlack is clearly losing, but we need to find the best defensive resources. Let's evaluate the candidate moves:\n1. Rg8 - blocks the g-pawn but allows Qe7+ winning the rook\n2. Rf8 - similar issues as Rg8\n3. Rd8 - trades rooks but leaves the g-pawn running: Rxd8 Qxd8+ Kh7 Qf6 g8=Q\n4. Rc8 - doesn't address any threats\n5. Rb8 - same\n6. Ra8 - same\n7. Re7 - pins the queen but after Qxe7 g8=Q we're lost\n8. Rxe6 - desperate sacrifice: dxe6 g8=Q but we're still lost\n9. h5 - interesting, trying to create counterplay: gxh6 g8=Q Qxg8+ Kxg8 and we might have some drawing chances\n10. a5 - doesn't help\n11. c4 - creates a passed pawn but too slow\nThe best practical chance seems to be h5, trying to create some counterplay against White's king while slowing down the g-pawn's promotion. After gxh6, we can try to activate our rook and create threats against White's king.\n```\nh5\n```"
