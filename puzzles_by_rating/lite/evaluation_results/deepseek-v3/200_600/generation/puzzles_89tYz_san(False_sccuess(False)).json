When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a king on g6, pawns on h5 and g4\n2. Black has a king on d2 and a pawn on b3\n3. It's White's move (as indicated by \"w\" in the FEN)\nEvaluation:\n- Black's pawn is very close to promotion (only needs b3-b2-b1=Q)\n- White has two passed pawns but they're further from promotion\n- The key question is whether White can stop Black's pawn while advancing their own\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. King moves toward Black's pawn: g6f5, g6f6, g6f7\n2. King moves toward White's pawns: g6g7, g6h7\n3. Pawn advances: h5h6, g4g5\nAnalysis:\n- If we move the king toward Black's pawn (e.g. g6f5), Black can push b3-b2 and our king is too far to stop it\n- If we push h5h6, Black can respond with b3-b2 and we can't stop promotion\n- g4g5 seems interesting as it creates a passed pawn, but Black can still push b3-b2\n- g6h7 is interesting as it prepares to support the h-pawn's advance while keeping options to move toward Black's pawn if needed\nAfter careful consideration, g6h7 seems most flexible:\n- It prepares h5-h6-h7-h8=Q\n- The king can still potentially move toward Black's pawn via h7-g6-f5-e4-d3-c2 if needed\n- It maintains maximum options while making progress with our pawns\nOther moves either allow Black's pawn to promote or don't make progress with our own pawns.\n```\ng6h7\n```"
