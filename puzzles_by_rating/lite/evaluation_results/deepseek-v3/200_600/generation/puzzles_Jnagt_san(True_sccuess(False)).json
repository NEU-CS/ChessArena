If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a strong centralized queen on d4 and bishop on c4\n3. Black's king is still in the center (g8) which could be a target\n4. Black's knight on f6 is defending d5 but is overloaded (it's also protecting h7)\n5. Black's a7 pawn is undefended\n6. Black's dark squares around the king look weak (f6, h6)\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qxa7 - wins a pawn but allows Black counterplay with ...Bg4\n2. Qxf6 - tempting but after ...gxf6, Black's king position is weakened but we lose our strong queen\n3. Bxf7+ - not legal (bishop is blocked by pawn on e6)\n4. Qh4 - threatens mate on h7, forces Black to react\n5. Bg5 - develops with tempo against the knight\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qh4 is very strong as it threatens Qxh7# (since the f6 knight is pinned to the king)\n- Black's only ways to prevent mate are:\n  a) ...h5 (but then g4 opens more lines)\n  b) ...g6 (but then Qh6 with deadly threats)\n  c) Moving the knight allows Qxh7#\n  \nThis seems like the most forcing and dangerous continuation for Black. Other moves like Qxa7 or Qxf6 are less precise.\n```\nQh4\n```"
