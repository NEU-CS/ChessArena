When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black has a very active rook on c4 and queen on b2\n3. White's king is somewhat exposed\n4. Black's knight on g4 is threatening to go to e3 or f2\n5. White's queen is on a8 with some potential to check\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qf8+ - forces the king to move, but after ...Kxf8 we lose our queen for nothing\n2. Qxc6 - takes a pawn but allows ...Qxa2 with threats\n3. Nxg4 - eliminates the knight but opens up the position\n4. Rxb2 - trades rooks but leaves us vulnerable to queen checks\n5. Rg1 - defends against knight checks but passive\n6. Qb7 - keeps queen active while defending a2\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qb7 seems most prudent, maintaining queen activity while defending the a2 pawn\n- It prevents ...Qxa2 which would be dangerous\n- Keeps options open for future play\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\nOther moves:\n- Qxc6 allows ...Qxa2 with threats against our king\n- Nxg4 opens up the position when our king is exposed\n- Rxb2 Qxb2 leaves us vulnerable to queen checks\n- Qf8+ is just bad as we lose the queen\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQb7\n```"
