If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has 2 rooks vs Black's rook, bishop and knight. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White has doubled rooks on the c-file and a rook on a7\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- Black has a passed pawn on b3 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is relatively safe on g1\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxe7+: This sacrifices a rook but could lead to a strong attack. After Kxe7, Rc7+ forks king and bishop. Black would likely play Ke8, then we can play Rxb7 with a strong position.\n- Rxa4: Takes the pawn but allows Black to consolidate with moves like Rb4.\n- Rc7: Puts pressure on the bishop but doesn't create immediate threats.\n4. Calculation of Rxe7+:\n- Rxe7+ Kxe7 (forced)\n- Rc7+ Ke8 (Kf8 allows Rxc6 with advantage)\n- Rxb7 and now:\n  - White has rook + pawn vs bishop + knight\n  - Black's king is exposed\n  - White can push passed pawns on kingside\n  - Black's pieces are uncoordinated\nThis seems like the most promising line as it activates our pieces and creates threats against Black's king while eliminating their most dangerous passed pawn.\nOther moves either don't create enough pressure or allow Black to consolidate. The sacrifice leads to a favorable endgame.\n```\nRxe7+\n```"
