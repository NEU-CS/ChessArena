When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The position is roughly balanced.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong centralized queen on d4 and bishop on c3 targeting Black's kingside\n- Black's king is still in the center (f8) which could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on d5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's queen on e7 is somewhat passive\n3. Threats:\n- White could potentially play Qd4-h4 with threats against the kingside\n- The d5 pawn could advance further if not restrained\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7d7: Queen moves to d7 to defend the d5 pawn and connect rooks\n- f8e8: King moves towards castling by hand (though it's already move 18)\n- a8d8: Rook moves to central file\n- e7e6: Queen moves to e6 to control more space\nAfter considering these options, e7d7 seems most prudent because:\n- It defends the d5 pawn which is currently under attack (White's queen eyes it)\n- It connects the rooks and improves queen activity\n- It maintains flexibility for future plans\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\nOther options:\n- f8e8 would leave the d5 pawn undefended\n- a8d8 would be met with Qxd5 winning a pawn\n- e7e6 would block the e-pawn and make the queen a target\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne7d7\n```"
