If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is still in the center (e8) and not castled yet, though they have rooks connected on the h-file.\n3. White has a knight on g5 that's very active and threatening.\n4. Black has some weaknesses on the dark squares, especially around their king.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Nxf7 - This looks tempting as a sacrifice to open up Black's king position. After Kxf7, we have Qf5+ with strong attacking chances.\n2. Nh7 - Threatening to win the exchange, but Black can defend with Rh8.\n3. Qxd5 - Winning a pawn but allowing Black to develop counterplay with ...Bf5.\n4. h5 - Pushing the pawn to open lines against Black's king.\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Nxf7 is the most forcing and promising move. Let's calculate it deeper:\n  17. Nxf7 Kxf7 (forced)\n  18. Qf5+ Ke8 (Kg7 runs into 19. Bxe6 with devastating threats)\n  19. Bxe6 Qc6 (only move to defend f7)\n  20. Bxd5 Qxd5\n  21. Qxd5 Nxd5\n  22. Nxd5 and White is up a pawn with a better position.\nThis line shows White gets a clear advantage. Other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate.\n```\nNxf7\n```"
