When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully.\nThe FEN indicates it's White's turn (the \"w\" in the notation). The material is roughly equal, but White has a dangerous passed pawn on g5 and an active bishop on h5. Black has a knight on f1 that's not very active.\nKey observations:\n1. White's g5 pawn is very strong and close to promotion\n2. Black's king is on e7, exposed to checks\n3. White's bishop controls important squares near Black's king\n4. Black's knight is somewhat out of play on f1\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h5e8 - Bishop checks the king, forcing it to move\n2. h5f7 - Bishop checks the king on f7\n3. g5g6 - Pushing the passed pawn\n4. a3a4 - Advancing the a-pawn\nLet's evaluate these:\n1. h5e8+ forces Ke7-f8 (only legal move). Then we can play g5g6 with strong threats. Black's king would be very restricted.\n2. h5f7+ forces Ke7xf7 (only move). Then g5g6+ and the pawn is unstoppable: Kf7xg6 loses to a3a4 with the a-pawn running, while Kf7-g7 allows g6-g7 and promotion.\n3. g5g6 immediately. Black can respond with Ke7-f7, but then h5e8 is strong, cutting off the king from the pawn.\n4. a3a4 is too slow and doesn't address the immediate opportunity.\nBetween h5e8+ and h5f7+, h5f7+ seems more forcing as it immediately wins the pawn after the king takes. The line:\nh5f7+ Ke7xf7\ng5g6+ Kf7xg6\na3a4 and the a-pawn will queen with no counterplay.\nThis seems like the most direct path to victory. The other moves either don't win immediately or give Black more chances.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh5f7\n```"
