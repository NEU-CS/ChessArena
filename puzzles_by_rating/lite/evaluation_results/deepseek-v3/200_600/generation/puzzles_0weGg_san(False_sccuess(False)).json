When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has queen, bishop, rook, pawns\n- Black has queen, bishop, rook, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has better piece activity\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on a6 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e4 is strong but potentially exposed\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawn weaknesses around it\n- White has potential threats against the black king\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) a6c8 - Queen sacrifice to win the rook, but after ...Qxc8 White gets material but loses initiative\nb) b5e8 - Bishop sacrifice, but after ...Kxe8 Qxe6+ Kf8, unclear\nc) e1e4 - Rook takes bishop, but after ...fxe4 White's queen is hanging\nd) c1h6 - Bishop move threatening mate on g7, looks very strong\nAfter careful consideration, c1h6 seems the most promising:\n- Threatens mate on g7 (Qxg7#)\n- Black has limited ways to defend:\n  - If ...gxh6, then Qxe6+ wins the queen\n  - If ...Qe7, then Qxe6+ Qxe6 Rxe6 and White is up material\n  - If ...Bf6, then Qxe6+ Qxe6 Rxe6 and White is better\n  - If ...Bxh6, then Qxe6+ Qxe6 Rxe6 and White wins material\nThis move creates immediate threats that Black cannot easily parry without material loss.\n```\nc1h6\n```"
