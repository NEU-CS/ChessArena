If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Key features:\n- White's queen on e4 is very active, eyeing the black king\n- Black's queen on b3 is also active, but somewhat exposed\n- White's bishop on d4 is strong, controlling key diagonals\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed c6 pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qh7+ or Qg6+\n- Black's immediate threat is Qxf3, winning a pawn\n- Black needs to address king safety while maintaining counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Qxf3: Wins a pawn but leaves king exposed after Qh7+ Kf8 Qh8+ Ke7 Qxg7\n- Kh8: Gets king to safer square but passive\n- Be5: Blocks e-file and challenges White's strong bishop\n- Qb6: Defends c6 pawn and maintains queen activity\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qxf3 looks tempting but leads to dangerous king exposure\n- Be5 seems solid, trading off White's strong bishop\n- Qb6 maintains activity while defending the c6 pawn\nThe best move appears to be Be5, as it:\n- Challenges White's strong bishop\n- Blocks the e-file\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n```\nBe5\n```"
