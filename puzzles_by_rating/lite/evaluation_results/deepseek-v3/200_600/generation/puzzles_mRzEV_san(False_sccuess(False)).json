When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on b4, attacking b2 and e1\n- White's pawn on e5 is passed and strong\n- Black's king is still in the center (d8)\n- White has some pressure on the dark squares (bishop on a4, pawn on d5)\n3. Threats:\n- Black has Qxb2 threat\n- Black has Bxh2+ threat after moving the queen\n- White has potential discovered attacks with the rook on e1\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f6: trades pawn for knight, opens e-file\n- c1h6: develops bishop with tempo on f8 rook\n- a4e8: sacrifices bishop to expose black king\n- d1f3: blocks the bishop and defends b2\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e5f6 seems strong as it:\n  * Removes a defender of black's king\n  * Opens the e-file for white's rook\n  * Creates potential for discovered attacks\n  * The pawn is immune due to Qxe1+ Rxe1 Bxe1 and white recaptures with check\nOther moves:\n- c1h6 is interesting but black can ignore it\n- a4e8 is tempting but may not be enough after Kxe8\n- d1f3 is too passive\nThe best move is to capture the knight and open lines against black's king.\n```\ne5f6\n```"
