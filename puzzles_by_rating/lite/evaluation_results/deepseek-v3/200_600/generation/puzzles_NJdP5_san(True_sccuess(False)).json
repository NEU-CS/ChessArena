When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, pawn on b6, pawn on f7, rook on a7, rook on d7, bishop on e6\n- White has: king on g2, pawn on b2, pawn on f6, queen on h6\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen is very active on h6, eyeing the f8 square which is only defended by Black's king\n- Black's king is exposed on f8 with limited escape squares\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rooks are not very active and the bishop is blocked by its own pawn on f7\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Kg8: Gets the king away from the immediate threat of Qf8#\n- Ke8: Also moves the king away from Qf8# threat, but leaves the f7 pawn undefended\n4. Evaluation:\n- After Kg8, White can play Qg7 threatening Qf8# next move. Black would have to play Rf7 to block, but then Qxf7+ wins the rook.\n- After Ke8, White can play Qg7 threatening Qe7#. Black would have to play Re7 to block, but then Qxe7+ wins the rook.\nBetween the two options, Kg8 is slightly better because:\n- It keeps the f7 pawn defended\n- After Qg7 Rf7 Qxf7+, at least Black can recapture with Kxf7, while after Ke8 Qg7 Re7 Qxe7+, White keeps the queen\nHowever, the position is clearly lost for Black in both cases due to White's overwhelming activity and threats. But Kg8 prolongs the game slightly more.\n```\nKg8\n```"
