If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

White has doubled rooks on the g-file which could be dangerous.\n2. Key features:\n- White has pressure on g7 with Rg6 and Bb4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed in the center\n- Black's queen is active but could be vulnerable\n- White has potential threats against the black king\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rg8: Defends g7 but blocks the bishop\n- Rh6: Counterattacks the rook but allows Qxh6\n- Bf6: Defends g7 while developing the bishop\n- Qa6: Moves queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- e5: Gains space but opens diagonals\n- f5: Counterplay but weakens e6\n4. Best options:\n- Bf6 seems solid, defending g7 and developing\n- Qa6 is safe and maintains queen activity\n- Rg8 is direct but passive\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- Bf6 allows White to play Qe5 with strong pressure\n- Qa6 is safe but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- Rg8 is the most forcing move, preventing any immediate tactics on g7\nThe best move is:\n```\nRg8\n```\nThis defends g7 and prepares to potentially double rooks on the g-file later. It's the most solid choice that maintains Black's position without creating new weaknesses."
