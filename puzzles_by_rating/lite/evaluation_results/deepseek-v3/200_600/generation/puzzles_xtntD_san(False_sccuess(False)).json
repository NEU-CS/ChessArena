When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has strong pressure on the e-file with both rooks\n- White's bishop is active but potentially vulnerable\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n- Black's bishop on c7 is strong, pointing at White's kingside\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3e2: Capturing the rook, but after ...Rxe2 White loses material\n- e1e2: Challenging the rook directly, but Black can take with ...Rxe2 and after Bxe2 Rxe2 White is worse\n- f3d5: Centralizing the bishop, but Black can play ...Rxe1+ followed by ...Bxd5\n- f3c6: This looks interesting, attacking the bishop and potentially winning material\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- f3c6 attacks the bishop and if Bxc6, Rxe2 Rxe2 leaves White with bishop vs rook which is roughly equal\n- But Black doesn't have to take, and can instead play ...Rxe1+ first\n- However, after f3c6 Rxe1+ Rxe1 Bxc6, White has Rook vs Bishop which may be slightly better\nThe best move seems to be f3c6, as it creates the most complications and chances for White. Other moves either lose material or lead to clearly worse positions.\n```\nf3c6\n```"
