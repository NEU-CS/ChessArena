When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has 2 rooks, bishop vs Black's queen, bishop, knight). However, White has a strong centralized bishop on f5 and better coordinated pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on d4 is very active but potentially exposed\n- White has doubled rooks on the c-file\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's bishop on f5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n3. Threats:\n- Black's queen is threatening to take on b2 (Qxb2)\n- White has potential threats against Black's king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5h7: Bishop sacrifice to expose Black's king\n- c8f8: Pinning the bishop to the king\n- c1c7: Doubling rooks on the 7th rank\n- f5d7: Attacking the knight while defending c8\n5. Analysis of f5h7:\n- f5h7+ Kxh7\n- c1h1+ Kg8\n- c8g8+ Kxg8\n- Rh8# \nThis appears to be a forced mate in 4 moves!\n6. Verification:\nAfter f5h7+ Kxh7 (forced), c1h1+ Kg8 (only move), c8g8+ (discovered check) Kxg8 (forced), Rh8 is mate. The king has no escape squares and Black has no interpositions.\nThis is the most forcing and decisive continuation. All other moves either don't lead to immediate decisive advantages or allow Black counterplay.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf5h7\n```"
