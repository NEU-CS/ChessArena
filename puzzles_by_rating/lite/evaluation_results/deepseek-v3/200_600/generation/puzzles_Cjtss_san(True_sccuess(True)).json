When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, N, B, R, pawns on a2\n- Black has: R, Q, B, pawns on a3, h7, e3\n- Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on c1 is attacking White's king\n- White's knight on b3 is pinned to the king by Black's bishop on e3\n- White's queen on b7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n3. The move Nxc1:\n- Captures the black queen but loses the knight to Bxc1\n- After Nxc1 Bxc1, White would have Q+R vs R+B, which is roughly equal\n- However, this allows Black to consolidate their position\n4. Alternative ideas:\n- Qc7 attacks the rook on c8 while maintaining pressure\n- Qd5 centralizes the queen and threatens multiple things\n- Rf3 could be interesting to defend against the pin\n5. Best move:\nAfter considering all options, Qc7 seems strongest as it:\n- Attacks the rook\n- Maintains pressure on the position\n- Doesn't allow Black to simplify\n- Keeps all of White's active pieces in play\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQc7\n```"

Let me re-analyze the position and provide the correct move in SAN notation.\nGiven the position:\n- White is to move and is under pressure from Black's queen on c1.\n- The knight on b3 is pinned to the king by the bishop on e3.\n- The only legal move provided is Nxc1, which is indeed a forced move to address the immediate threat.\nAfter Nxc1 Bxc1, White can follow up with Qxc8, winning the rook, leading to a roughly equal endgame (Q vs R+B). While this simplifies the position, it's the only legal move to avoid immediate material loss or worse.\nThus, the correct move is:\n```\nNxc1\n```"
