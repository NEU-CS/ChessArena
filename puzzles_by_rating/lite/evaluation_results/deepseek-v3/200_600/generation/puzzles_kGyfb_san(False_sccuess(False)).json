When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, B, N, R, 4 pawns\n- Black has: Q, B, N, R, 6 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White has strong pressure with the queen on b8 and bishop on g4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's rook on a2 is undefended\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n3. Candidate moves:\na) c6d8 - Blocking the queen's attack on the rook with the knight\n   - After Qxd8, Kxd8, Black loses the exchange but gets some compensation\n   - Not ideal as we're giving up material\nb) c6b8 - Capturing the queen with the knight\n   - Nxb8, but then Rxb8 and we lose the knight for queen\n   - This is clearly bad\nc) a5d8 - Moving the queen to defend the rook\n   - Qd8 defends the rook and blocks the queen's attack\n   - After Qxd8, Kxd8, we maintain material equality\n   - This seems best as it maintains material balance\n4. Evaluation:\n- Qd8 is the only move that doesn't lose material immediately\n- It maintains defensive coordination\n- Other moves either lose material or lead to worse positions\nThe best move is to defend the rook with the queen while blocking the attack. Here's the move:\n```\na5d8\n```"
