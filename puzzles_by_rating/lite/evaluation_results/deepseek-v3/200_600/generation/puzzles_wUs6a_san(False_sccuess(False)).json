When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a knight on h5 attacking White's queen\n3. White has a strong pawn on f5 that could become dangerous\n4. Black's rooks are not well coordinated\n5. White has pressure along the g-file and h1-a8 diagonal\nThe most critical threats:\n- White could play Qxh5 next move, winning material\n- White could push f6, further opening Black's king position\n- White has potential for a kingside attack with pieces well-placed\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h5f6 - Knight takes bishop, but after Qxh5 we lose material\n2. h5g3 - Knight moves to g3, but after fxg3 we're still in trouble\n3. e7f6 - Bishop moves to f6, blocking the f-pawn and defending h5\n4. g7g6 - Pushing the pawn to challenge White's queen\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e7f6 seems best as it:\n  - Blocks the dangerous f-pawn\n  - Defends the h5 knight\n  - Maintains control over key squares\n  - Keeps the bishop active\n- Other moves either lose material or allow White to strengthen their attack\nThe move h5f6 is tempting but after:\n13... Nxf6 14. Qxh5 and Black is down material with no compensation.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne7f6\n```"
