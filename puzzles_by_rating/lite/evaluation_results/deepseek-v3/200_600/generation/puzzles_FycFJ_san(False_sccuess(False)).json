When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has more active pieces with the bishop on f4 and rook on e5\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n4. White has a passed c-pawn that could become dangerous\n5. Black's rook on e8 is tied to defending the e-file\nKey observations:\n- White's rook on e5 is very active and potentially threatening\n- Black's bishop on f5 is a good piece but could be vulnerable\n- We need to find a way to activate our pieces while limiting White's activity\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e8e7 - Moving the rook off the e-file to avoid potential exchanges\n2. f5g6 - Moving the bishop to a safer square while maintaining control\n3. a8d8 - Centralizing the rook to a more active position\n4. c6c5 - Challenging White's pawn structure\nAfter evaluating:\n- e8e7 seems passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n- f5g6 is solid but doesn't improve our position much\n- a8d8 is interesting but may not be the most urgent\n- c6c5 looks most promising as it:\n  * Challenges White's pawn structure\n  * Opens the c-file for potential counterplay\n  * Limits White's options to advance the c-pawn\n  * Prepares potential ...b5 breaks in the future\nThe move c6c5 also prevents White from playing c4-c5 in the future, which would give them a strong passed pawn. It's the most active and principled move in this position.\n```\nc6c5\n```"
