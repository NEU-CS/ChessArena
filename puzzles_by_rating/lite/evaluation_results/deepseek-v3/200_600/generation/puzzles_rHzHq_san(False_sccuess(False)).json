When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns)\n2. White has a very active position with:\n   - Knight on g6 threatening fork possibilities\n   - Queen on f4 with multiple attacking options\n   - Rooks connected on the d and f files\n3. Black has some weaknesses:\n   - King still in the center (e8)\n   - Bishop on b7 is blocked by pawns\n   - Some loose pawns (c5, d4)\nKey observations:\n- The knight on g6 is extremely dangerous and can deliver a decisive fork if it reaches f8 or e7\n- Black's queen on c6 is defending e7 and f7 squares\n- The pawn on h6 is loose and can be captured by the queen\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g6e7 - Forking queen and bishop, but black can play Qxe7\n2. g6f8 - Forking rook and king, but black can play Rxf8\n3. f4h6 - Winning the h6 pawn but not the most forcing\n4. f4f7 - Attacking the bishop and threatening mate\n5. d1d4 - Challenging the d4 pawn\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- f4f7! is very strong as it attacks the bishop and threatens Qxg7# next move\n- Black's only way to defend is Qxf7, but then Nxe7+ forks king and queen\n- If black tries Bxf7, then Qxf7+ and black's king is exposed\nThe most forcing and winning line is:\n1. f4f7 Qxf7 (forced)\n2. g6e7+ Kd8 (only move)\n3. Nxf7+ winning the queen\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf4f7\n```"
