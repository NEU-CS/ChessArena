When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's two rooks and pawns. Black is up a rook but White has some compensation with the passed e-pawn.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous if advanced\n- Black's rooks are active but not coordinated yet\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on h8\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f1f6: Trading rooks would simplify to a lost pawn endgame\n- e4e5: Advancing the passed pawn, but it's not well supported\n- h1g1: Moving the king to safety\n- f1a1: Rook to a-file to potentially support a2-a4 push\n4. Best plan:\n- First priority is to safeguard the king by moving it to g1\n- Then look to activate the rook and push pawns\n- Avoid trading rooks unless absolutely necessary\n5. Why h1g1 is best:\n- Gets the king away from potential back rank threats\n- Prepares to possibly bring the rook to the 2nd rank later\n- Maintains all options for pawn pushes\n- Doesn't allow Black to immediately coordinate rooks\nOther moves like e4e5 are premature as the pawn isn't well supported, and rook moves don't address the king safety issue first.\n```\nh1g1\n```"
