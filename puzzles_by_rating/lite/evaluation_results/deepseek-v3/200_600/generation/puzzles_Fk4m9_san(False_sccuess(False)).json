When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has Rook, Knight, Bishop, 5 pawns\n- Black has Rook, Knight, 2 pawns\nWhite is up a full piece (Bishop vs nothing) and has more pawns.\n2. Key features:\n- White's Rook on e7 is very active\n- Black's King is exposed on b6\n- White has a passed e-pawn\n- Black's a4 Rook is active but not immediately threatening\n- White's Knight on b5 is well placed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Rook moves: e7e8 (queening threat), e7b7 (attacking king)\nb) Knight moves: b5d6 (centralizing), b5c7 (fork possibility)\nc) Bishop moves: e3h6 (attacking pawns)\n4. Deep analysis:\n- e7e8 looks tempting but after ...Rxe8, Nxe8 Kc7 we lose the initiative\n- b5d6 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- e7b7! is strong: \n  - If Kxb7, then Nc7 forks king and rook\n  - If Ka5, then Rb1 with threats against the king\n  - Black has no good way to defend against this\n5. Other considerations:\n- Need to be careful about back rank issues (though none immediate)\n- Black's knight on g7 is passive\n- White's king is safe\nThe most forcing and advantageous move is e7b7, creating immediate threats against Black's exposed king while maintaining material advantage.\n```\ne7b7\n```"
