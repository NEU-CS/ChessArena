When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop (White has 2 bishops vs Black's 1). White also has a passed pawn on d6 that's very dangerous.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on b6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's rook on e6 is active\n- Black's king is exposed on c8\n- White's pawn on d6 is a major threat that needs to be addressed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c8b8: Gets the king away from potential checks\n- e7g6: Develops the bishop to a more active square\n- d7e6: Captures the dangerous rook but opens up the position\n- f6f5: Creates luft for the king but weakens e6\n4. Best move analysis:\n- c8b8 seems passive but necessary to avoid potential checks\n- e7g6 looks tempting but doesn't address the immediate threat of d6-d7\n- d7e6 is risky as after dxe6, White's bishop pair becomes very strong\n- f6f5 creates an escape square but weakens e6\nThe most pressing concern is White's passed pawn on d6. The best way to deal with it is to capture the rook on e6, even though it opens up the position. After dxe6, Black can try to activate the bishop and create counterplay.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd7e6\n```"
