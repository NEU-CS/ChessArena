When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, 2 pawns\nWhite is up a minor piece (Bishop + Knight vs Queen)\n2. Key features:\n- White has strong pressure on e6 (Rook on e6)\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White's pieces are very active (Bishop on a6, Knight on b5)\n- Black's queen is somewhat exposed on c6\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qf3-c6 or Nb5-d6\n- Black needs to defend against immediate threats while trying to create counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\na) c6d7 - Queen moves to defend the rook\n   - But allows Qf3-c6+ winning the queen\nb) c7e7 - Rook moves to defend the queen\n   - But then White can play Qf3-c6+ anyway\nc) c6e8 - Queen moves to safety\n   - But allows Nb5-d6+ winning the rook\nd) c6b5 - Queen takes knight\n   - Qxb5 Rxe6 and Black is still losing\ne) c6d6 - Queen blocks the rook\n   - Best option as it defends against immediate threats while keeping material\nAfter careful consideration, c6d6 seems the most resilient move:\n- It blocks the rook's attack on e6\n- Maintains the queen's defense of the rook on c7\n- Doesn't immediately lose material\n- Creates potential for future counterplay\nOther moves either lose material immediately or lead to worse positions. While the position remains difficult for Black, c6d6 offers the best chance to continue fighting.\n```\nc6d6\n```"
