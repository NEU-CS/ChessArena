When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king (g8), pawns (b5, f7, g7, h7), rook (a6), rook (e5), bishop (f6)\n- White has: king (g1), pawns (a2, c2, c3, f2, g2, h2), rook (d1), rook (d8), bishop (f4)\n2. Positional factors:\n- Black's rooks are active, especially the one on e5 controlling the e-file\n- White's rooks are doubled on the d-file, with one penetrating to d8\n- Black's bishop is somewhat restricted by its own pawn on e6\n- White's bishop is active on f4, eyeing the b8-h2 diagonal\n3. The only legal move given is f6d8, which is the bishop capturing the rook on d8.\nEvaluation of f6d8:\n- Material: Black trades bishop for rook (loses minor piece for rook)\n- After capture: Bxd8, White would likely recapture with Rxd8\n- Resulting position would have:\n  - Black: Rooks on a6 and e5 vs White's rook on d8\n  - Black's pawn structure remains intact\n  - White's remaining rook would be very active on d8\n4. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves available for Black in this position\n- All other pieces are either blocked or would leave the king in check\n5. Conclusion:\n- While trading bishop for rook is generally unfavorable, it's the only legal move\n- The position after the exchange is still playable for Black with active rooks\n- Black must make this move as there are no alternatives\nFinal move:\n```\nf6d8\n```"
