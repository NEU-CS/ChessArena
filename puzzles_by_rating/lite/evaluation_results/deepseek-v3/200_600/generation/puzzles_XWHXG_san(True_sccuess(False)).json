When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "```\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a knight on h8 (very advanced!), bishop on c4, queen on f3, and standard other pieces. Black has queen on e7, knight on c6 and f6, bishop on h4, and standard other pieces. Material is roughly equal.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's knight on h8 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's bishop on h4 is pinning the f3 queen to the white king\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White has some attacking potential with the advanced pieces\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxf6: Capturing the knight, but after ...gxf6, Black gets a strong pawn center\n- Qh5+: Checks the king, but after ...g6, Qxh4 gxh5 and Black is fine\n- Bf7+: Interesting sacrifice, after ...Kxf7 Qxf6+ Kg8 Qxh8+ Kf7, White has rook and knight for queen\n- Nf7: Threatening Qxf6 with discovered attack on the queen\n- Qxc6: Capturing the knight, but after ...bxc6, Black gets central control\n4. Best move seems to be Nf7:\n- Attacks the black queen\n- If queen moves, then Qxf6 wins a piece\n- If ...Qxf7, then Qxf6 wins the knight\n- If ...exf7, then Qxf6 is strong with threats against the black king\nThe move Nf7 creates multiple threats and maintains White's initiative while keeping material balance.\n```\nNf7\n```"
