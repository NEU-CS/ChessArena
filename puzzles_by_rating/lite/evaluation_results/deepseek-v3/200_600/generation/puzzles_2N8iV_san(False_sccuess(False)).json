When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, queen, knight, pawns vs White's similar pieces). \n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous. White has pressure on the f-file and g-file with the rook on g6.\n3. Key threats: White's rook on g6 is very active and threatens to double on the g-file or potentially infiltrate. The bishop on b4 pins the knight on c6 to the queen.\n4. Black's problems:\n   - King safety is the biggest concern\n   - The pinned knight on c6 is vulnerable\n   - The queen on b5 is somewhat exposed\n5. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - h8g8 - connects rooks and prepares to castle by hand\n   - e8d7 - moves the king to safety\n   - d8d7 - connects rooks and defends the knight\n   - b5a6 - moves the queen to safety\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h8g8 looks most logical as it connects rooks and prepares to castle by moving the king next move\n- e8d7 is also reasonable but leaves the h8 rook hanging\n- Other moves either don't address king safety or lose material\nThe best move is to connect rooks and prepare to get the king to safety:\n```\nh8g8\n```"
