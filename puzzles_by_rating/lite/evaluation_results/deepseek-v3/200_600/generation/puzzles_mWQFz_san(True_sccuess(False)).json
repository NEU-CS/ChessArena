If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

This is a king and pawn endgame where both sides have passed pawns.\n2. White's pawn is further advanced (b4 vs h5) and closer to promotion.\n3. Black's king is closer to White's pawn than White's king is to Black's pawn.\n4. The position appears to be a race to promote pawns.\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n1. Kc6 - moves towards center but away from both pawns\n2. Kb6 - moves towards a-file but not helpful\n3. Ka6 - moves away from action\n4. Kc5 - moves towards center and closer to both pawns\n5. Ka5 - moves towards a-file but not helpful\n6. Kc4 - moves towards center and closer to both pawns\n7. Ka4 - moves away from action\n**Best Move Reasoning:**\n- We need to either:\n  a) Support our pawn's advance, or\n  b) Interfere with Black's pawn advance\n- Kc5 is the most flexible move:\n  - It centralizes the king\n  - Prepares to support the b-pawn's advance (after b5, Kb6 would support)\n  - Can potentially cut off Black's king from the h-pawn\n- Other moves either don't help our pawn or allow Black's king to interfere with our pawn while advancing his own.\n**Calculation:**\nAfter 1. Kc5:\n- If 1...Kf4 (heading towards b-pawn), we can play 2. Kd4 interfering\n- If 1...h4, we can play 2. b5 with good winning chances\n- If 1...Kh3, we can play 2. b5 Kxh2 3. b6 Kg3 4. b7 h4 5. b8=Q and win\nThis seems like the most promising path to victory.\n```\nKc5\n```"
