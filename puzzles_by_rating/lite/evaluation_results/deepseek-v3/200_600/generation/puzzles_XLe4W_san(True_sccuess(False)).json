If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Black's bishop on g4 is active but potentially unstable\n4. White has pressure on the c-file with queen and bishop battery\n5. Black's king is still in the center (though castled kingside)\nKey considerations:\n- White threatens to play Bxh7+ at some point (bishop on c2 pointing at h7)\n- The bishop on g4 is under attack by the knight on f3\n- We need to either defend the bishop or make it count before retreating\nCandidate moves worth considering:\n1. Bxf3 - trading the bishop immediately\n2. Bh5 - keeping the bishop active\n3. Bxd4 - sacrificing the bishop for central control\n4. e5 - challenging in the center\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- Bxf3 Qxf3 gives White the bishop pair but opens the g-file for our rook\n- Bh5 allows White to play h3, forcing the bishop back\n- Bxd4 cxd4 gives White a strong center but opens lines for our pieces\n- e5 is interesting but after dxe5 fxe5, White has good central control\nThe most dynamic option seems to be Bxd4, sacrificing the bishop to:\n- Destroy White's center\n- Open the f-file for our rook\n- Create potential threats against White's king\nAfter cxd4, we can follow up with Qd6 putting pressure on d4 and h2, or Ne5 to occupy the strong outpost.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBxd4\n```"
