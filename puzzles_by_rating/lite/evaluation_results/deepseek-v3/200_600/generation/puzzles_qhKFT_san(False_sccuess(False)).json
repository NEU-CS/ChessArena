When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on d4 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black has doubled rooks on the e-file, putting pressure on White's position\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n- Black's king is safer on g8\n3. Threats:\n- Black is threatening to play Re1+ winning the bishop on f2\n- Black could also consider R8e2 with strong pressure\n4. Candidate moves:\na) g3f1 - This blocks the e-file and defends against Re1+, but leaves the bishop awkwardly placed\nb) f2g1 - Moves the bishop to safety while keeping it active\nc) f2e1 - Sacrifices the bishop to eliminate one of Black's rooks\nEvaluation:\n- f2e1 seems too materialistic and gives Black the initiative after Rxe1\n- g3f1 blocks the rook but makes the bishop passive\n- f2g1 is the most flexible, keeping the bishop active while removing it from attack\nBest move is to preserve the bishop's activity while removing it from danger. The bishop can still participate in both defense and potential counterplay from g1.\n```\nf2g1\n```"
