When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key observations:\n- Black's king is vulnerable with open e-file\n- White has a strong knight on g6 attacking h8 and e7\n- Black's queen on c6 is overloaded defending e7 and c5\n- White's queen on f4 has many attacking options\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Nxe7: Wins the bishop but allows Qxe7\n- Qxf7+: Forcing move, but after Kd7 white doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- Qxh6: Wins a pawn but doesn't maximize the attack\n- Qd6: Pins the queen to the king\n- Nxh8: Wins the rook but allows counterplay\n4. Best move seems to be Qd6:\n- Pins the black queen to the king\n- Threatens Qxc6 winning the queen\n- If black plays Qxd6, then Nxe7+ forks king and queen\n- If black moves king, then Nxe7+ wins the bishop\n- If black tries to defend with Bc8, then Nxh8 wins material\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous continuation. Other moves either don't maximize the attack or allow black counterplay.\n```\nQd6\n```"
