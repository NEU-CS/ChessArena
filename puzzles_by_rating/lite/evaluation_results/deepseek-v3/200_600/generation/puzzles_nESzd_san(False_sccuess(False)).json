When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully.\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a significant material advantage with a bishop and knight vs black's knight and bishop (though black's bishop is undeveloped).\n2. White's pieces are very active - the bishop on h6 is pinning the rook on g8 to the king, and the queen on b5 is eyeing the weak f7 pawn.\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover.\n4. Black has doubled rooks on the c-file, but they're not immediately threatening.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h6f8 - capturing the rook, but after ...Kxf8 white loses the initiative\n2. f5g7 - fork attacking queen and rook, but black can play ...Qxg7\n3. b5e8 - threatening mate on g8, but black can defend with ...Rxe8\n4. f5e7 - attacking the queen while clearing f5 for other pieces\n5. b5d7 - attacking the rook while maintaining pressure\nAfter careful consideration, f5e7 seems strongest:\n- It attacks the queen on g6, forcing it to move\n- Opens the f-file for the rook\n- Maintains all of white's threats\n- After ...Qxe7, white can play Qxe7 with a winning material advantage\n- Even if black tries ...Qh5, white can play Qd7 winning the rook on c7\nOther moves either don't maintain the initiative or allow black counterplay. f5e7 keeps maximum pressure while simplifying to a winning endgame.\n```\nf5e7\n```"
