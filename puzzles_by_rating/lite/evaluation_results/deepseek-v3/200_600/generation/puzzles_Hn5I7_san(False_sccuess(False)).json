When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

First, let's understand the position:\n   - Black to move (we are Black)\n   - Material: Black has queen, rook, bishop vs White's queen, rook, bishop, pawns\n   - White's queen is on d8, very active\n   - Black's rook on c8 is under attack by White's queen\n   - Black's rook on e7 is also under attack by White's queen if it moves to d8\n   - Black has a queen on f5 and bishop on h5\n2. Candidate moves:\n   - c8d8: This would trade rooks but leave our e7 rook hanging to White's queen\n   - e7e8: This would promote the rook to a queen (but we don't have that option here) or just move it to e8\n3. Evaluating c8d8:\n   - After c8d8 Qxd8, our e7 rook is still hanging\n   - White would then play Qxd8 winning a rook\n   - This loses material\n4. Evaluating e7e8:\n   - This moves the rook out of danger\n   - It maintains the rook's activity on the e-file\n   - It prevents immediate material loss\n   - The rook is safe on e8 as it's protected by the king\n5. Best move:\n   - e7e8 is clearly better as it doesn't lose material immediately\n   - After e7e8, we maintain our position and can look for counterplay with our queen and bishop\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne7e8\n```"
