When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

King safety:\n- White king is relatively safe on h3\n- Black king is exposed on h8\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's rook on a2 is threatening to promote\n- Black's bishop on f1 is attacking White's rook on f6\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Kh4: Gets the king more active but doesn't address immediate threats\n- Rxf1: Captures the bishop but allows Black's rook to promote\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- Rxf1 seems forced as the bishop is attacking our rook\n- After Rxf1, Black can play Ra1 threatening to promote\n- However, White has Rf8+ Kh7 Rf7+ forcing the black king to h8 in a repetition\n- Alternatively, White can play Bg6 threatening mate with Rh1\nThe best move is to capture the bishop immediately:\n```\nRxf1\n```"
