When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (b4), Rook (c3), Bishop (e5), Bishop (e2), pawns (c2, f4, g2, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (d8), Rook (d1), Bishop (a2), Knight (e4), pawns (a7, b7, f5, g7, h7)\n- Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two bishops)\n2. Key features:\n- Black has strong pressure on d1 with rook and bishop battery\n- White's rooks are active on b4 and c3\n- Black's knight on e4 is well placed but potentially vulnerable\n- White's bishop on e5 is very strong\n3. Threats:\n- Black is threatening to play Rxd1, winning the bishop on e2\n- White needs to protect the bishop or move it to safety\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e2f1: Moves bishop to safety but blocks the g2 pawn\n- e2d1: Interposes the bishop on the d-file, blocking the rook's attack\n5. Evaluation:\n- e2d1 seems better because:\n  - It maintains the bishop's activity\n  - It blocks the rook's attack on d1\n  - After Rxd1, White can recapture with Rxd1\n  - The bishop on d1 still eyes important squares\n6. Potential continuation after e2d1:\n- Black might play Rxd1\n- White recaptures Rxd1\n- Then White can consider moves like Rdd4 or Rdb1 to increase pressure\nAfter careful consideration, e2d1 is the better move as it maintains material equality while keeping active pieces.\n```\ne2d1\n```"
