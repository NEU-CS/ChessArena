When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong pawn center with pawns on c4, d4, e5\n- Black's queen is very active on g5\n- White's queen on e4 is exposed and could be a target\n- Black has a knight on d3 that's deep in White's territory\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on b1\n3. Threats:\n- White is threatening to play Bxd3, removing the strong knight\n- Black needs to maintain activity while not losing material\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5e3: Pinning the bishop on b2 to the king\n- d3e5: Capturing the e5 pawn with the knight\n- g5d8: Moving the queen to d8 to defend the knight\n- g5h6: Moving the queen to h6 to maintain pressure\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g5e3 looks very strong as it pins the bishop and threatens to win material\n- After g5e3, if White plays Bxd3, Black can recapture with Qxd3, maintaining the pin\n- Other moves either lose material or give up the initiative\nThe best move is:\n```\ng5e3\n```"
