When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is still in the center while White can castle\n4. Black's rooks are connected on the back rank\n5. White has a space advantage with pawns on e5 and f4\nKey considerations:\n- Castling would be good to connect rooks and get the king to safety\n- The e5 pawn is strong but needs support\n- We should be careful about opening files for Black's rooks\nCandidate moves:\n1. O-O (e1g1) - Safest option, gets king to safety and connects rooks\n2. e5e6 - Pushing the passed pawn but it might be premature\n3. a1d1 - Centralizing the rook but leaves king exposed\n4. f4f5 - Gains space but weakens e5 pawn\nBest move is to castle, as it:\n- Safeguards the king\n- Connects the rooks\n- Prepares to double rooks on the d-file later\n- Maintains all positional advantages\nOther moves either leave the king exposed or don't improve our position as much.\n```\ne1g1\n```"
