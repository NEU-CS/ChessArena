When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- Black has a rook on e2 attacking the f2 pawn\n- White's bishop is well placed on f3, controlling important diagonals\n- Black's bishop on c7 is unprotected\n- White's rook on e1 is tied to defending the e2 rook's attack on f2\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bxc6: Wins a pawn but after bxc6, Black's rook remains strong on e2\n- Bd5+: Checks the king, but after Kh8, we haven't solved the e2 rook threat\n- Bxe2: Simplifies but gives up our strong bishop for a rook\n- Rxe2: Also simplifies but leaves us with bishop vs bishop\n- Kh1/Kf1: Gets out of potential back rank threats but doesn't address the e2 rook\n4. Best move seems to be Bxc6:\n- Wins a pawn immediately\n- After bxc6, we can consider moves like Re3 to defend f2 or even Rc1 to attack the c6 pawn\n- Black's e2 rook is strong but we'll have material advantage\n- The bishop on c7 was a good defender, removing it weakens Black's position\nOther options either don't win material or allow Black to maintain pressure. Winning a pawn while keeping active pieces is the most promising path.\n```\nBxc6\n```"
