When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (c6), Queen (h5), Rook (c1), Bishop (g2), pawns (b2, a2, h3, d4)\n- Black has: King (h8), Bishop (c7), Queen (d6), Rook (g6), Rook (f1), pawns (a6, b5, h7, g7, d5)\n- Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs queen but Black has extra pawn)\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook is attacking White's rook on c1 (f1 attacks c1)\n- White's queen is very active on h5\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n- White has doubled rooks on the c-file\n3. Candidate moves:\na) h2g1 - This would block the attack on the rook by moving the bishop to g1\nb) c1f1 - This would trade rooks by capturing on f1\nLet's evaluate both options:\na) h2g1:\n- Blocks the attack on the rook\n- But the bishop becomes passive on g1\n- Black could play Qd6xc6 next, winning the rook\n- After Qxc6, White can play Qxh7+ but after Kg8, Black is better\nb) c1f1:\n- Trades rooks: Rxf1, Rxf1\n- Then Black has Qd6xc6, but White can respond with Qxh7+ Kg8 Qxg7#\n- Wait, let's see: after Rxf1 Rxf1, if Qxc6 then Qxh7+ Kg8 Qxg7 is indeed mate\n- Black would have to find another move instead of Qxc6, but all alternatives seem bad\nTherefore, c1f1 is the better move as it leads to a forced mate or significant material gain. The bishop move h2g1 would be too passive and allow Black counterplay.\nAfter c1f1 Rxf1 Rxf1, if Black doesn't take the rook, White can play Qxh7+ Kg8 Qxg7# anyway. The position collapses for Black.\n```\nc1f1\n```"
