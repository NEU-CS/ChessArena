If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White is up a pawn (queen vs rook+bishop is roughly equal, but White has extra pawns).\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e5, eyeing the black rook and potentially threatening checks\n- Black's bishop is misplaced on a2, not contributing much\n- White has a passed pawn on c2 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxe5: Trading the rook for queen would leave bishop vs rook, which is losing\n- Re7: Protecting the 7th rank and keeping the rook active\n- Bxb3: Removing a pawn but leaving the bishop even worse\n- King moves: Not helpful as they don't improve the position\n- Pawn moves: Need to be careful not to create weaknesses\n4. Best option seems to be Re7:\n- Keeps the rook active and defended\n- Protects against potential Qe8+ ideas\n- Maintains material balance\n- Prepares to possibly double rooks if the bishop can get back into play\nOther moves either lose material or worsen the position. Re7 is the most solid choice that maintains counterplay.\n```\nRe7\n```"
