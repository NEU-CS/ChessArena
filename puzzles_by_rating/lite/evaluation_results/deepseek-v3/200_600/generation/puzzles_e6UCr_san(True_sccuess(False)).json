White has a passed pawn on a6 that is very advanced\n2. Black's pawn on f5 is not yet threatening to promote\n3. The key question is whether White can promote the a-pawn before Black can create counterplay\nCandidate moves:\n1. Kc6 - moves towards the a-pawn but blocks its path\n2. Kc5 - similar to Kc6\n3. Ka5 - moves away from the pawn but keeps the king close\n4. Kc4/Kb4/Ka4 - all move the king away from the pawn\nBest move analysis:\n- We need to support the a-pawn's promotion\n- Moving the king towards the pawn (Kc6/Kc5) actually blocks it\n- Ka5 is interesting as it keeps the king near the pawn while allowing it to advance\n- The other moves move the king too far away\nAfter Ka5:\n- If ...Kb8, then a7 and the pawn promotes\n- If ...Kb7, then Kb5 and we're back to similar position but with pawn advanced\n- Black can't stop the pawn's advance\nTherefore, Ka5 is the most precise move to ensure the pawn's promotion while keeping the king active.\nFinal move:\n```\nKa5\n```"

Current material: White has king + a-pawn vs Black's king + f-pawn.\n3. White's king is on a5, Black's king is on a7.\n4. White's pawn is on a6, Black's pawn is on f4.\nKey observations:\n- White's a-pawn is very advanced and can potentially promote with proper king support.\n- Black's f-pawn is also dangerous and could become a threat if not contained.\n- The kings are in direct opposition on the a-file.\nCandidate moves:\n1. Kb5 - moves towards the center and prepares to support the a-pawn\n2. Kb4 - same idea but less central\n3. Ka4 - moves away from the pawn and seems less active\nBest move analysis:\n- Kb5 is strongest as it:\n  - Maintains opposition against Black's king\n  - Prepares to support the a-pawn's advance (after a7, Kb6)\n  - Can potentially swing to the kingside to stop Black's f-pawn if needed\n- Other moves either don't make progress (Ka4) or are less flexible (Kb4)\nBlack's main threat is pushing the f-pawn, but with Kb5 White can respond to f3 with Kc4, keeping the pawn under control while still supporting the a-pawn.\n```\nKb5\n```"
