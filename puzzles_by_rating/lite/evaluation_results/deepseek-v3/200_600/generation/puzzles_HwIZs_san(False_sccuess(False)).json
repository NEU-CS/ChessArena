When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on f4 is very active\n- Black's queen on c4 is centralized but potentially exposed\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h7\n- White's queen on g3 has good attacking potential\n- Black has doubled rooks on the d and f files\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...Qxf1 mate if White isn't careful\n- Black could play ...Rxd1+ if White's bishop moves\n- White has potential mating threats against Black's king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) f4g6 - knight sacrifice to open Black's king\nb) g3g6 - queen sacrifice with similar idea\nc) f1d3 - defending against mate while attacking queen\nd) g3h4 - bringing queen closer to Black's king\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f4g6 looks tempting but after ...fxg6, White doesn't have enough follow-up\n- g3g6 is more promising: after ...fxg6, f4g6+! hxg6, Qh3+ leads to mate\n- f1d3 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- g3h4 is good but not as forcing as g3g6\nThe best move is the queen sacrifice g3g6, which forces mate or wins decisive material:\n1. g3g6 fxg6 (forced)\n2. f4g6+ hxg6 (only move)\n3. Qh3+ Kg7\n4. Qh7# \nEven if Black tries 1...Qxg6, White wins with 2. f4xg6+ hxg6 3. Qxg6+ Kh8 4. Qh6+ Kg8 5. Qh7#\n```\ng3g6\n```"
