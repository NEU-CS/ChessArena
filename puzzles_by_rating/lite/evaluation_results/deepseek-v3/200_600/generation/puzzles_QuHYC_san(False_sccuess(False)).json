When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White is up a Bishop and pawn, which is a decisive material advantage.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is on a6, somewhat exposed\n- White has two rooks and a bishop controlling important squares\n- The f4 pawn is passed and can be pushed\n- Black's rook on e8 is the only active piece\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b3b8 - rook takes rook, but after Kxb8 the position simplifies too much\n- b2f6 - bishop move attacking the rook, but Re6 defends\n- f4f5 - pawn push to create more space\n- b3h3 - rook swing to h-file with potential threats\n- b2e5 - bishop centralization\n4. Best move seems to be b3b7! with the following ideas:\n- Attacks the black king directly\n- If Kxb7, then Rb2+ wins the rook (Kc7 Rxb2)\n- If Ka5, then Rb5+ wins the king\n- If the rook moves, we can follow up with Rb6+ winning material\n- It maintains maximum pressure while keeping all pieces active\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black some counterplay. b3b7 is the most forcing move that leads to a quick win.\n```\nb3b7\n```"
