When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has pressure along the a3-f8 diagonal\n- Black's f6 queen is somewhat awkwardly placed\n- White has potential threats with the g4 pawn and h4 knight\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6h6: Gets the queen out of the way and eyes h4 square\n- f6g6: Covers g5 square but blocks the g-pawn\n- f7g5: Interesting knight move attacking h3 pawn\n- c8d7: Developing the bishop and connecting rooks\n- e8e7: Centralizing the rook\n4. Threats to watch for:\n- White could play Qc2-f5 in some lines\n- White's knight could jump to f5\n- White might push g5 at some point\nAfter careful consideration, f6h6 seems most promising because:\n- It removes the queen from the potentially dangerous f6 square\n- It eyes the h4 square which could be useful if White plays g5\n- It maintains flexibility for the queen\n- It doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\nOther moves like f7g5 look tempting but after Nxg5 hxg5 Qxg5, White gets some play against the black king.\nHere's the move:\n```\nf6h6\n```"
