If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a strong bishop on h6 pinning the queen to the king\n3. Black's knight on h5 is under attack by White's queen on g4\n4. White has a strong pawn on f5 restricting Black's position\n5. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the h-file potentially opening\nKey considerations:\n- The knight on h5 is in danger and needs to be addressed\n- The pin on the queen is problematic\n- We need to maintain control of the position while resolving these issues\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Nf6 - unpins the queen but allows Qxh7+ after gxf6\n2. g6 - defends the knight but weakens the kingside\n3. Qe6 - moves the queen out of the pin while maintaining pressure\n4. Qxf5 - sacrifices the queen but leads to complications\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g6 seems forced to protect the knight, though it weakens the dark squares\n- Qe6 is interesting but allows White to play Qxh5\n- Nf6 is too dangerous due to Qxh7+ threats\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threats or worsen the position\nThe best practical choice is to play g6, accepting some kingside weakness but maintaining material balance and the knight. This also prevents immediate tactical disasters.\n```\ng6\n```"
