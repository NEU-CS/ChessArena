When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king, bishop, 4 pawns\n- White has: rook, king, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (bishop vs rook with pawns)\n2. Positional factors:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n- White's rook is active on the 7th rank\n- Black's bishop is active but could be more effective\n- Both sides have passed pawns (White's f-pawn, Black's b-pawn)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6d5: Centralizes the bishop and eyes White's pawns\n- b3b2: Advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n- f7f5: Creates a passed pawn but opens the position\n- e6f5: Attacks the f4 pawn and gains space\n4. Key threats:\n- White could play Kxb3 at some point\n- White's rook could become more active\n- Black needs to activate the bishop while keeping the king safe\nAfter careful consideration, e6f5 seems strongest because:\n- It attacks the f4 pawn immediately\n- Gains space for the bishop\n- Prepares potential future pawn breaks with ...g5\n- Doesn't weaken Black's position like f7f5 would\n- More active than retreating moves like e6d7\nOther options:\n- e6d5 is decent but doesn't create immediate threats\n- b3b2 is tempting but White can respond with Kxb2\n- f7f5 weakens the e6 square and opens the position unnecessarily\nHere's the move:\n```\ne6f5\n```"
