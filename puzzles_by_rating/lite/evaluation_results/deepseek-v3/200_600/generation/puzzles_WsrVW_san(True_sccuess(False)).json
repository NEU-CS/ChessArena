If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Black has a passed pawn on b4 that could become dangerous\n4. White has a passed pawn on g5 that's advanced but blocked by the f7 pawn\n5. Black's rook on a2 is very active\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rh2+ - forces the king to g4 where it's more exposed\n2. Bf1+ - forces the king to move, possibly to g4\n3. Rg2 - attacking the g5 pawn\n4. Rb2 - preparing to push the b-pawn\nLet's evaluate:\n- Rh2+ forces Kh3-g4, then we can play Rg2 attacking the g5 pawn\n- Bf1+ forces Kh3-g4 (Kh3-h4 loses to Rh2#), then we can play Rg2\n- Rg2 immediately allows White to defend with Rg1\n- Rb2 is slow and allows White to consolidate\nThe most forcing line is Rh2+:\n1... Rh2+\n2. Kg4 (forced, as Kh4 allows Rh2#)\nNow we can play Rg2 attacking the g5 pawn, and White has problems defending it.\nAlternative Bf1+:\n1... Bf1+\n2. Kg4 (Kh4 Rh2#)\nNow Rg2 is coming with similar ideas\nBetween these, Rh2+ seems more direct as it immediately forces the king to g4 where it's more exposed. After Rh2+ Kg4 Rg2, White has to find precise moves to defend.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRh2+\n```"
