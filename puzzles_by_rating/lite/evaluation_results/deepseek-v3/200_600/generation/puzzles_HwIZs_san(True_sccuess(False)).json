When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on h7\n- White has threats against g6 (Nxg6 or Qxg6+)\n- Black's queen on c4 is undefended\n- Black has doubled rooks on the f-file\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Nxg6 - wins a pawn but allows Kxg6\nb) Qxg6+ - forces Kxg6 Nxe4+ with perpetual check\nc) Qc3+ - forks king and queen, winning the queen\nd) Bxc4 - wins the queen but allows Rxf4\n4. Best move analysis:\n- Qc3+ is clearly winning as it forks the king and queen. After Qxc3, Bxc3 leaves White up a queen for a rook.\n- Other moves either don't win material or allow counterplay.\n5. Calculating Qc3+:\n33. Qc3+ Qxc3\n34. Bxc3 and White is clearly winning with an extra queen vs rook.\nAll other moves either don't win material or allow Black counterplay. Qc3+ is the most forcing and decisive move.\n```\nQc3+\n```"
