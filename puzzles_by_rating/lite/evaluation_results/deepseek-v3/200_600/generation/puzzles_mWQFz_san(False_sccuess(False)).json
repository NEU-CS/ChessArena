When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This is a king and pawn endgame where both sides have passed pawns.\n2. White's pawn is further advanced (b4 vs h5) but Black's king is closer to White's pawn.\n3. The position appears to be a theoretical draw with best play, but White must be careful not to allow Black's king to stop the pawn while also preventing Black's pawn from queening.\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n1. b5c6 - King moves towards Black's pawn but leaves b-pawn undefended\n2. b5b6 - Advances king but allows Black to approach with ...Kf4\n3. b5a6 - Moves king away from both pawns, not helpful\n4. b5c5 - Centralizes king but doesn't make progress\n5. b5a5 - Similar to a6 but slightly better\n6. b5c4 - Gets closer to both pawns, best option\n7. b5a4 - Moves away from the action\nThe best move is b5c4 because:\n- It brings the king closer to both pawns\n- Prepares to support the b-pawn's advance (b4-b5 next)\n- Cuts off Black's king from approaching via d4\n- Maintains flexibility to go after Black's h-pawn if needed\nAfter b5c4, Black's best response would likely be Kf4, but White can then push b5 and the position remains balanced.\n```\nb5c4\n```"
