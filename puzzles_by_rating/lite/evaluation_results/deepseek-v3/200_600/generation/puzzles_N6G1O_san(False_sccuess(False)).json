When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White: Bishop (a8), Queen (e7), Rook (h4), pawns (a2, b3, c2)\n- Black: Queen (b6), pawns (a6, b5, f6), Bishop (f4)\n- White is up a minor piece (Bishop vs pawn)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on b1\n- Black king is exposed on c3 but has some pawn cover\n3. Key threats:\n- Black has a discovered check possibility if the bishop moves\n- Black queen is attacking the b3 pawn\n- White's rook and queen are well placed for potential threats\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7c5: Queen checks the king, forcing it to move\n- h4h8: Rook lift to potentially create mating threats\n- a8b7: Bishop moves to defend the b3 pawn\n- e7b4: Queen checks the king from another angle\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e7c5 looks very strong as it forces the black king to move (only legal response is Kd2)\n- After Kd2, we can follow up with h4h8 threatening mate\n- The black queen is tied to defending the b5 pawn, so can't easily counterattack\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous sequence. The immediate check limits Black's options and maintains our initiative.\n```\ne7c5\n```"
