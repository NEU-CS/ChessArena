When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has queen, bishop, pawn on b7, g2, h2\n- Black has queen, rook, pawn on f7, g6, h7\n- White is up a pawn (passed on b7) but material is roughly equal\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is attacking White's g2 pawn\n- Black's rook is on e1, attacking White's queen\n- White's queen can capture the rook (Qxe1)\n- White has a passed pawn on b7 that's close to promotion\n- Black's king is on g8\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Only legal move is Qxe1, so let's analyze its consequences:\n  - After Qxe1, Black can play Qxe1+\n  - Then White must move the king (only Kg2 or Kh1)\n  - If Kg2, Black can play Qe2+ winning the g2 pawn\n  - If Kh1, Black can play Qf1+ followed by Qxg2\n  - In either case, Black will win White's pawns and the position becomes lost\n4. Alternative ideas:\n- There are no other legal moves available\n- The position is forced into a losing endgame\n5. Conclusion:\nDespite the unfortunate outcome, Qxe1 is the only legal move. The position is lost due to the material imbalance and Black's active pieces. \n```\nQxe1\n```"
