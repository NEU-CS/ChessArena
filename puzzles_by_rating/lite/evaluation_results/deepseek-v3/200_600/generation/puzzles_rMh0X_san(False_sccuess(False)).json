When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has queen, rook, bishop, 5 pawns\n- White has queen, rook, 2 bishops, 5 pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but Black has a passed pawn on b2 that's about to promote\n2. Key features:\n- Black's b2 pawn is one square away from promotion\n- White has pressure on the dark squares with bishops on d3 and g3\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's queen on e1 is well placed to defend against promotion threats\n3. Candidate moves:\na) b2b1q - promoting immediately\n   - White can respond with Qe1xb1, but then Qd5xb1 and Black wins material\n   - However, after Qe1xb1 Qd5xb1, Bg3xb1 and Black loses the new queen\n   - So promotion might not win material immediately\nb) d5d1 - attacking the white queen\n   - Qe1xd1, b2b1q and Black gets a queen\n   - But White has Bg3xd1, maintaining material balance\nc) d5a2 - attacking the rook\n   - Ra2xa2, b2b1q and Black gets a queen\n   - But White can play Qe1xa2, maintaining material balance\nd) d5d8 - threatening mate on d1\n   - This looks strong as it creates multiple threats\n   - White would have to respond to the mate threat, allowing b2b1 next move\nAfter careful consideration, d5d8 seems the most promising as it creates immediate threats while maintaining the promotion threat on b2. White will be forced to deal with the mate threat first, allowing Black to promote next move with decisive advantage.\n```\nd5d8\n```"
