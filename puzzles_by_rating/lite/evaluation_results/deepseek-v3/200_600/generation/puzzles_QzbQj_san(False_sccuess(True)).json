When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n   - White has a strong bishop on f6, pinning the black knight on a5 to the queen\n   - Black's queen is somewhat exposed on d8\n   - White has pressure on the e-file with rook on e1\n   - Black's light-squared bishop is passive on b7\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e7f6 - Capturing the strong bishop, but after Bxf6, White maintains pressure\n2. d8d7 - Moving the queen to safety, but blocks the bishop\n3. c8c7 - Centralizing the rook, but doesn't address immediate concerns\n4. b7a8 - Retreating the bishop, but very passive\n5. a5c6 - Moving the knight to a better square, but allows Bxc6\nBest option seems to be e7f6, trading off White's strong bishop:\n- After e7f6, White likely plays Bxf6\n- This removes the pin on the knight\n- Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n- Simplifies the position slightly\nOther moves either leave White's initiative intact or create new weaknesses. While trading is generally good when you're slightly worse, here it helps neutralize White's active pieces.\n```\ne7f6\n```"
