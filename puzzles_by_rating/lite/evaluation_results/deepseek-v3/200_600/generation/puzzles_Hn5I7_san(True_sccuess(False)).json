When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, B, 2 pawns\n- Black has: R, R, Q, B, 3 pawns\nBlack is up a rook and pawn, but White has some compensation with active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is attacking Black's rook on c8\n- Black's queen is very active on f5\n- Black's bishop on h5 is pinning White's pawn on f3 to the king\n- White's rook on h1 is unprotected\n3. Candidate moves:\na) Rxd8 - This wins the queen for a rook, but after Qxd8, Black's material advantage would be reduced to just a bishop (Q+R+B vs R+B). Not ideal when we're currently up more material.\nb) Re8 - This defends the rook on c8 while maintaining all of Black's material advantage. After this move:\n- The rook on c8 is protected\n- The queen on f5 remains very active\n- The bishop on h5 maintains its pin\n- Black can consider moves like Qxf3 next if White doesn't defend properly\n4. Evaluation:\nRxd8 simplifies too much and reduces our advantage. Re8 maintains all our positional and material advantages while keeping the position complex, which favors the side with more material.\nThe best move is clearly Re8, maintaining all of Black's advantages and keeping the position complicated.\n```\nRe8\n```"
