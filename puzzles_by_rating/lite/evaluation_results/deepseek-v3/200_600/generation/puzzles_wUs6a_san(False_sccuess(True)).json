When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rooks, minor pieces and pawns)\n2. White has a strong bishop on h6 pinning the black queen to the king\n3. Black's knight on h5 is under attack by White's queen on g4\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the h-file potentially opening\n5. White has a space advantage with pawns on e4 and f5\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Qxh5, which would win a pawn and expose Black's king further\n- The knight on h5 is poorly placed and needs to be addressed\n- The bishop on h6 is very strong and should be neutralized if possible\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h5f6 - Moving the knight to safety while attacking the bishop\n2. h5g3 - Forking the queen and pawn, but White can play Qxg3\n3. g7g5 - Trying to block the bishop's diagonal, but weakens the kingside\n4. e7f6 - Trading queens, but after Bxf6 White has strong pressure\nBest option seems h5f6:\n- Gets the knight to safety\n- Attacks the strong bishop\n- After Bxf6, we can recapture with Qxf6, trading off White's strong bishop\n- This relieves pressure and maintains material equality\nOther options:\n- h5g3 allows Qxg3 with a strong attack\n- g7g5 weakens the kingside too much\n- e7f6 gives up the queen too early\nAfter h5f6 Bxf6 Qxf6, the position is more balanced. White's attack is reduced and Black can complete development.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh5f6\n```"
