When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king (f8), pawn (b6), rook (a7), rook (d7), pawn (f7), pawn (g6)\n- White has: queen (h6), pawn (b2), pawn (f6), pawn (g2), king (h2), bishop (e6)\n2. Positional factors:\n- White's queen is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's rooks are not coordinated\n- White's bishop is pinning the pawn on f7 to the king\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Qxg6+ next move if Black doesn't address it\n- The pin on f7 is very dangerous\n4. Move options:\n- f8g8: moves the king towards the corner but doesn't address the pin\n- f8e8: moves the king towards the center and breaks the pin\nAnalysis of f8g8:\n- After f8g8, White can play Qxg6+ with check\n- Then after ...f7xg6, fxg7 would win material\n- This seems bad for Black\nAnalysis of f8e8:\n- This breaks the pin on f7\n- If White plays Qxg6, then ...f7xg6 and fxg7 is not possible because the king is on e8\n- The position remains complicated but more defensible\nConclusion: f8e8 is the better move as it breaks the dangerous pin and avoids immediate material loss.\n```\nf8e8\n```"
