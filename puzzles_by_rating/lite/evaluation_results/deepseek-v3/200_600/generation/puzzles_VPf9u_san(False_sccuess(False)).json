When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: rook, bishop, queen, pawns\n- White has: 2 rooks, bishop, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on e8 is very active, pinning Black's rook on a8 to the king\n- Black's queen is exposed on f6\n- White's bishop on h6 is very strong, eyeing f8\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with limited pawn cover\n3. Candidate moves:\na) a8e8 - This would trade rooks, but after Rxe8 Rxe8, White's remaining rook is very active and Black's king remains exposed. Not ideal.\nb) c5f8 - This is a defensive move, blocking the bishop's attack on f8. Let's analyze:\n- After Bf8, White can play Rxf8+ Kxf8\n- Then Qxf6+ wins the queen, but after ...gxf6, Black is down material\n- Alternatively, White could play Qe7 threatening mate, but Black has Qg7 defending\n- The position remains complicated but Black survives\n4. Evaluation:\n- a8e8 leads to a clearly worse position\n- c5f8 is the only way to defend against immediate threats\n- After c5f8, Black can try to consolidate and counterattack\nThe best practical chance is to block with the bishop, despite the material loss, as it keeps the position more dynamic and avoids immediate collapse.\n```\nc5f8\n```"
