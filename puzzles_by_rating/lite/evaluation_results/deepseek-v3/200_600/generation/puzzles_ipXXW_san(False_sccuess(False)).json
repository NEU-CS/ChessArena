When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White: Queen, Bishop, 3 pawns, Rook, King\n- Black: Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns, Knight, Rook (on a2), King\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very active\n- Black has a rook on a2 threatening White's b2 pawn\n- White's bishop on g5 is pinning Black's knight on f6 to the queen on e7\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) g5f6 - capturing the pinned knight\nb) e5b8 - queen move attacking the rook\nc) a1a2 - trading rooks\nd) e5e6 - centralizing queen further\n4. Analysis:\n- g5f6 looks very strong as it wins material (bishop takes knight) and maintains pressure\n- After g5f6 exf6, White can play e5e6 with strong threats against Black's king\n- a1a2 is tempting but after rxa2, bxa2 leaves White's pawn structure weakened\n- e5b8 is interesting but allows Black counterplay with ...b4\n5. Best move:\ng5f6 is the most forcing and wins material immediately while maintaining all of White's advantages. Black cannot recapture with the queen due to the pin, and after exf6, White's queen will dominate the position.\n```\ng5f6\n```"
