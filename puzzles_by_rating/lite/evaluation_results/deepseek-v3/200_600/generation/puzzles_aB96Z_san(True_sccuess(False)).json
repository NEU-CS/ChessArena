When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8 with White's rook on b8\n3. Key threats: White has potential threats like Rb8-b7 attacking f7 or pushing passed pawns\n4. Black's active pieces: The rook on f7 is well placed, queen on a4 is active\nLooking at the two legal moves:\n- Rf8: This would block the back rank but leave the rook passive and allow White to play Rb7 attacking f7\n- Qe8: This defends the back rank while keeping the queen active. It also prepares to potentially double rooks on the f-file or bring the queen to defense\nQe8 is the better choice because:\n1. It maintains the rook's active position on f7\n2. Covers the back rank against potential mating threats\n3. Keeps the queen centralized for both defense and potential counterplay\n4. Doesn't allow White to immediately gain activity with Rb7\nThe move Rf8 would be too passive and give White the initiative.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQe8\n```"
