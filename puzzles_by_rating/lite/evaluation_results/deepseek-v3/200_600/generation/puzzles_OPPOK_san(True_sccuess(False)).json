When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's Rook is very active on h6, attacking f6 pawn\n- Black's pawn on c2 is threatening the a2 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on b6\n- White's bishop has good scope on f3\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxf6: Wins a pawn immediately, but after Kxf6 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- Bxc6: Wins the c2 pawn but allows Rxc6 with counterplay\n- Rh7: Improves rook position, threatens to go to b7\n- Bd5: Centralizes bishop, threatens to take f7 pawn\n4. Best move seems to be Bd5 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop powerfully\n- Threatens Bxf7 winning a pawn (if ...Kc7 then Bxf7 Rxf7 Rxf7+)\n- If Black tries to defend with ...f6, then Rxf6! is strong\n- Keeps all options open while improving the bishop\n- Doesn't allow any counterplay like Rxf6 might\nOther moves:\n- Rxf6 is tempting but leads to simplification\n- Bxc6 gives up the strong bishop\n- Rh7 is good but not as forcing\nAfter Bd5, Black is in serious trouble defending all threats.\n```\nBd5\n```"
