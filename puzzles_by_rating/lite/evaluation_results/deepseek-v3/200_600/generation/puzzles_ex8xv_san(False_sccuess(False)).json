When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (c3), Rook (d1), Knight (f5), pawns (a2,b2,c2,h2)\n- Black has: Rook (g2), Bishop (d5), pawns (a6,b7,f7,h7)\n- Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with knight vs bishop)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on b1 with black rook on g2\n- Black king is exposed on b4 but protected by bishop\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's rook on g2 is very active and threatening\n- White's knight is well placed on f5 but needs to be careful about bishop\n- White has doubled rooks on the c-file but they're not immediately useful\n- Black's bishop controls important squares near white king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5g7: attacking the f7 pawn and threatening fork on e6\n- f5d6: attacking bishop and controlling key squares\n- c3b3: pinning black king to bishop\n- d1d4: centralizing rook and attacking black king\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f5g7 looks tempting but after ...f6 the knight is trapped\n- c3b3 is strong as it pins the bishop to the king, forcing black to deal with it\n- Other rook moves don't create immediate threats\nThe best move is c3b3, creating a pin that black must address. This also clears the c-file for potential rook doubling later.\n```\nc3b3\n```"
