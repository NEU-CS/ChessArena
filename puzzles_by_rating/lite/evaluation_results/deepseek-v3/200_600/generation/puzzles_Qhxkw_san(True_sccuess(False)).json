If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Material is equal, but White's bishop is more active than Black's knight.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop is very active on c5, controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black has some pawn weaknesses on the queenside (b7 pawn is potentially weak)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bb6: Attacks the weak b7 pawn and pins it to the rook\n- e5: Advances the passed pawn, gaining space\n- Ra7: Puts pressure on the 7th rank and b7 pawn\n- Bd6: Centralizes the bishop and eyes f8\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Bb6 is very strong as it immediately targets Black's weakest point (b7 pawn)\n- After Bb6, Black has limited options:\n  - If ...Rb8, then Ra7 wins the pawn\n  - If ...Kf8, then Ra7 is still strong\n  - If ...Nd4, then Bxd4 exd4 and White can play Ra7 with advantage\nThe move Bb6 creates immediate tactical threats while maintaining positional pressure. Other moves like e5 or Ra7 are also good, but Bb6 is the most forcing and creates the most problems for Black.\n```\nBb6\n```"
