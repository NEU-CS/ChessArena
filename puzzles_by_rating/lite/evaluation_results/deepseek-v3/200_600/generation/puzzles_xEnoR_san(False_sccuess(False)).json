When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: 1 bishop, 1 knight, 1 queen, 2 pawns (but one is on b2 and vulnerable)\n- Black has: 2 rooks, 1 queen, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active (bishop on b7 is very strong, queen centralized). Black's rooks are not well coordinated yet.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on b7 is pinning the rook on b8 to the king\n- Black's queen on b6 is under attack from White's bishop\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is White can capture the queen with Bxb6\n- If we move the queen, we need to consider the pin on the b-file\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Queen moves:\n- b6d8: blocks the pin but allows Bxb8 winning the exchange\n- b6c7: unpins but leaves queen vulnerable\n- b6a7: interesting, attacking the bishop but allowing Bxb8\n- b6a6: safe but passive\nb) King moves:\n- g8h8/g8f8: gets out of potential future checks but doesn't address immediate threats\nc) Rook moves:\n- b8f8: breaks the pin but loses the queen to Bxb6\n- a2a8: interesting, could double rooks on the 8th rank\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to counterattack with the queen while maintaining the pin:\n```\nb6a6\n```\nThis move:\n1. Gets the queen to safety\n2. Maintains pressure on the b7 bishop\n3. Prepares potential discovered attacks if White takes the rook\n4. Keeps options open for future rook moves\nOther moves either lose material or are too passive. b6a6 maintains the dynamic balance in the position."
