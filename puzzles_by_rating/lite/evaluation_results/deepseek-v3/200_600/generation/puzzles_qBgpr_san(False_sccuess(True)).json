When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key observations:\n- White has a very strong queen on g6, attacking the f7 pawn and eyeing the h7 square\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White has a strong pawn center (c4, d4) and active pieces\n- Black's development is somewhat lagging (queen and rooks not fully active)\n3. The only legal move is h7g6, which is a pawn capture of the queen. This is forced.\n4. After h7xg6:\n- White will recapture with the bishop (Bxg6), maintaining material equality\n- Black will have relieved some pressure but still has development issues\n- The position remains complex but more balanced\nGiven that this is the only legal move, we must play it to avoid immediate loss of material. \n```\nh7g6\n```"
