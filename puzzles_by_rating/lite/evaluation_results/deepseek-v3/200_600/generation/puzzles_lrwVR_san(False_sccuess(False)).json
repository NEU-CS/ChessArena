When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's e5 rook is very active, controlling key squares\n4. White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n5. Black's king is safer on g8\nKey observations:\n- Black's doubled rooks on the e-file are threatening to penetrate\n- White needs to either challenge the rooks or improve piece coordination\n- The h3 pawn is vulnerable to potential ...Rh5 ideas from Black\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e1e5 - immediately challenging the rook. After ...rxe5, White can recapture with dxe5, but this leads to simplification.\n2. a1e1 - doubling rooks to challenge Black's control of the e-file\n3. g1h2 - moving the king to a safer square\n4. c3c4 - gaining space in the center\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e1e5 seems most principled, forcing Black to either exchange or retreat\n- If Black exchanges, we get a roughly equal rook endgame\n- If Black retreats, we gain control of the e-file\n- Other moves either don't address Black's pressure or leave our king exposed\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne1e5\n```"
