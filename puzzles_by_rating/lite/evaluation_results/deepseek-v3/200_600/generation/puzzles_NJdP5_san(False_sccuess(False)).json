When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king, pawn on b6, pawn on f7, pawn on g6, rook on a7, rook on d7, bishop on e6\n- White has: king on g2, pawn on b2, pawn on f6, queen on h6\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen is very active on h6, eyeing the g6 pawn and potentially the black king\n- Black's king is exposed with limited shelter\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rooks are not very active, but control the 7th rank\n3. Candidate moves:\na) f8g8 - moves the king towards the corner, potentially safer but may allow white to advance the f-pawn\nb) f8e8 - centralizes the king, but may be more exposed to queen checks\n4. Threats to consider:\n- White could play Qxg6, but after fxg6, Rxh6 is possible (though white's f-pawn is strong)\n- White could push f7, threatening to queen\n5. Evaluation:\n- f8g8 seems safer as it tucks the king away from potential queen checks along the e-file\n- f8e8 could lead to more active play, but with the queen so close, it's risky\n- The position is very sharp, and king safety is paramount\nAfter careful consideration, moving the king to g8 seems the most prudent choice to reduce immediate threats while keeping options to defend against the f-pawn advance.\n```\nf8g8\n```"
