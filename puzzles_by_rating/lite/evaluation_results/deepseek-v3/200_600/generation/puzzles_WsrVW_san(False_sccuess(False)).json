When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal but Black has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on f8 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White's king is exposed on h3\n- Black's bishop on c4 is pinning White's rook on g1 to the king\n3. Threats:\n- White has a discovered attack with the bishop on f3 (if the rook moves, Bxc4)\n- White's rook on g5 is threatening h5-h6 ideas\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8g8 - defends the g7 pawn and keeps rook active\n- c4d3 - unpins the rook but gives up the bishop\n- a2h2 - checks the king and forces it to move\n- f7f5 - challenges White's rook on g5\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f8g8 is solid but doesn't create threats\n- c4d3 gives up the bishop advantage\n- a2h2 looks most promising as it forces the king to move and maintains initiative\nThe best move is to check the king with the rook:\n```\na2h2\n```\nThis forces White's king to move (likely to g3 or g4), after which Black can continue with active play like ...f7f5 or ...c4d3 depending on White's response. The check maintains Black's initiative and keeps pressure on White's position."
