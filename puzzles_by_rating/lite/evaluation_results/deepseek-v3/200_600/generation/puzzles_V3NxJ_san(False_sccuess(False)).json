When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has Rook+Bishop vs Black's Rook+2 Bishops. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on e5 which could be significant.\n2. Key features:\n   - White's bishop on c3 is very active, controlling important diagonals\n   - Black's rooks are not developed (only one is on b8)\n   - Black's pawn structure is slightly compromised with doubled b-pawns\n   - White's king is safer than Black's\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - b1b8: Immediate rook exchange, but this might simplify too much\n   - c3a5: Attacking the b6 pawn, but Black can defend with Ra8\n   - c5c6: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n   - c3d4: Centralizing the bishop and putting pressure on e5 pawn\n4. Best plan:\n   - The most promising idea is to activate the rook while maintaining pressure. b1b6 looks interesting as it:\n     * Attacks the a6 pawn\n     * Pins the b7 pawn to the b8 rook\n     * Prepares potential doubling of rooks on the b-file\n     * Maintains flexibility for future operations\n5. Alternatives:\n   - c3a5 is tempting but after ...Ra8, White doesn't gain much\n   - c5c6 is premature as Black can easily block with ...Bc7\n   - Other rook moves don't create immediate threats\nAfter careful consideration, b1b6 is the most active and flexible move, creating maximum pressure while keeping all options open.\n```\nb1b6\n```"
