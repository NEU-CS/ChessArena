When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (b4), Rook (c3), Bishop (e5), Bishop (e2), pawns (c2, f4, g2, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (d8), Rook (d1), Knight (e4), Bishop (a2), pawns (a7, b7, f5, g7, h7)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black has a discovered attack on White's rook at b4 via the bishop on a2\n- White's rook on c3 is pinned to the king by Black's rook on d1\n- Black's knight on e4 is very active and threatening\n- White's bishop on e5 is strong but potentially trapped\n3. Candidate moves:\na) Bf1 - This would unpin the rook on c3 but leaves the rook on b4 hanging to the bishop on a2\nb) Bxd1 - Capturing the rook but after Rxd1, White's rook on b4 is still hanging\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- Bxd1 seems better because after Rxd1, we can play Rxe4! fxe4 Bxa8, winning material\n- The line would be: 24. Bxd1 Rxd1 25. Rxe4 fxe4 26. Bxa8 with a winning advantage\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBxd1\n```"
