When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (both have a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and pawns). White has a knight on f6 which is quite active.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong knight on f6 attacking Black's queen on d8 and pawn on h7\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White's queen on h5 is eyeing the h7 pawn\n- Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by pawns\n- White has castling rights while Black doesn't (though Black can still castle queenside)\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\na) e8f8 (King moves to f8):\n- Gets the king out of the pin on the e-file\n- But leaves the h7 pawn undefended against Qxh7\n- Also blocks the f8 rook from developing\nb) e7f6 (Bishop takes knight):\n- Removes the dangerous knight\n- Opens the e-file which might be dangerous\n- But after Bxf6, Qxh7 is not possible because the bishop defends h7\n- White would likely recapture with gxf6, weakening their pawn structure\nAfter considering both options, e7f6 is clearly better because:\n- It eliminates the active knight\n- Maintains defense of h7\n- While it opens the e-file, Black can quickly develop with ...0-0-0 next move\n- The doubled pawns White gets after gxf6 would be a long-term weakness\nThe alternative e8f8 would lead to immediate problems after Qxh7, and Black's position would remain cramped.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne7f6\n```"
