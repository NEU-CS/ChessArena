If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Black's king is somewhat exposed on the g8-h7 diagonal\n3. Black's knight on f6 is under pressure from White's bishop on d4\n4. Black's queen is centralized but could become a target\n5. White has potential threats like Bh7+ or Bxf6 ideas\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Kh8 - Gets the king off the dangerous diagonal but seems passive\n2. Qe7 - Defends the knight but blocks the e-file for the rook\n3. Nh5 - Challenges White's strong queen but leaves f6 weak\n4. Nxe4 - Tactical possibility, but after Bxe4 Qxe4, White has strong pressure\n5. d5 - Central break, but after exd5 cxd5 Bxf6, White gets strong play\nAfter careful consideration:\n- The immediate threat is White playing Bh7+ winning the exchange\n- We need to prevent this while maintaining piece coordination\n- Nh5 seems interesting as it challenges White's active queen\n- After Nh5 Qh4 Nf6, we've gained a tempo by forcing the queen to move\n- Other moves either allow Bh7+ or lead to positional concessions\nThe best move appears to be Nh5, forcing White's queen to retreat while maintaining control over key squares.\n```\nNh5\n```"
