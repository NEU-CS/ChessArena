If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8 with White's bishop on h6 eyeing it\n3. Piece activity: White's pieces are very active (queen on b5, knight on f5, bishop on h6)\n4. Threats: White has potential threats against the black king\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- Bg7+: Forcing the king to move and potentially opening up the position\n- Qe8: Threatening mate on g8 (but Black can defend with Qg7)\n- Qb7: Attacking the rook on c7\n- Ne7+: Forking queen and rook\nLet's analyze Bg7+:\n1. Bg7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n2. Qe8! Now threatening Qg8# \n   - Black's only defense is Qg7, but then 3. Qxg8+! Rxg8 4. Nxg7 winning material\nThis seems very strong. The alternative Ne7+ is also interesting but less forcing:\n1. Ne7+ Kh8 (if Qxe7, Qxe7 wins the queen)\n2. But Black has Rxe7 3. Qxe7 Qxe7 4. Rxe7 and we're in an equal rook endgame\nBg7+ leads to a more decisive advantage. The forced sequence wins material or leads to mate.\n```\nBg7+\n```"
