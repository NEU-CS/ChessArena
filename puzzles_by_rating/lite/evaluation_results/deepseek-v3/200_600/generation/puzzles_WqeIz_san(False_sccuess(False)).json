When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

However, White's pieces are more actively placed.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7 with weak dark squares around it\n- White has strong bishops pointing at Black's kingside\n- Black's queen and rook are lined up on the g-file\n- White has a pawn on h3 controlling g4\n3. Threats:\n- Black has potential threats along the g-file and with the bishop on e5\n- White can create immediate threats against Black's king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) c4g8 - Bishop sacrifice to expose the king\nb) e3a7 - Bishop sacrifice to win the pawn on a7\nc) c3d5 - Centralizing the knight with tempo\nd) d2d6 - Pushing the queen forward\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c4g8 is very tempting as it leads to forced mate: 1. Bxg8 Rxg8 2. Qxg5+ Kf8 3. Qf6+ Kg8 4. Rxe5 dxe5 5. Qxe5+ with mate to follow\n- Other moves don't create such immediate threats\n- The bishop sacrifice is sound because even if Black doesn't take, White gains a strong attack\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc4g8\n```"
