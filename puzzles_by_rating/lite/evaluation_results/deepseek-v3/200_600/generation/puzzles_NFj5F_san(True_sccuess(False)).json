When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's rooks are not well coordinated (a8 and f8)\n4. White's king is still in the center but can castle\n5. Black's king is on g8 with potential weaknesses on the kingside\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) Castling (O-O) - Safest option, brings king to safety and connects rooks\nB) e6 - Pushing the passed pawn, but after ...dxe6 the position opens up\nC) Rg1 - Prepares g4 push but seems slow\nD) Ra6 - Targets the c6 pawn but doesn't achieve much immediately\nLooking deeper:\n- After O-O, White can follow up with ideas like Rd1, f5, or h4-h5\n- Black's counterplay is limited as their pieces are passive\n- The e5 pawn is strong and can be supported by f5 later\n- Castling removes any back rank threats\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create weaknesses. Castling is the most principled move here, securing the king while maintaining all positional advantages.\n```\nO-O\n```"
