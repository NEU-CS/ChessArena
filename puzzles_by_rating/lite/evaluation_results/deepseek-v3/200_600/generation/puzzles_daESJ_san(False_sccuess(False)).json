When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have roughly equal material, but White has more active pieces.\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed in the center (e8) with White's queen and knight threatening. White's king is safer on b1.\n3. Key threats:\n   - White's queen on h5 is eyeing the f7 pawn which is only defended by the black queen.\n   - White has a rook on g2 pointing at the g-file.\n   - Black's e6 queen is under attack by White's e5 knight.\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - e8f8: Gets the king to slightly safer position but doesn't address other threats\n   - e8d8: Similar to e8f8 but less safe as it moves toward White's rook\n   - h8h5: Exchanges queens but leaves f7 pawn vulnerable\n   - e6f7: Saves the queen but blocks the f7 pawn's defense\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e6f7 seems forced to save the queen, though it's not ideal as it blocks the f7 pawn's defense.\n- h8h5 would lose material after Qxh5 Nxh5, and then White can play Nxf6+ winning a pawn.\n- King moves don't address the immediate threats.\nThe best practical choice is to save the queen with e6f7, despite the positional concession.\n```\ne6f7\n```"
