When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's bishop on c7 is very strong, targeting White's kingside.\n3. White's bishop on e3 is somewhat passive.\n4. Black has potential threats with the queen on d6 and bishop on c7.\n5. White's rooks are not optimally placed yet.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e3h6 - Trading off Black's strong bishop\n2. c3d5 - Centralizing the knight with tempo on the queen\n3. d1d3 - Improving the queen's position\n4. g2g3 - Preventing any future ...Bg4 ideas\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e3h6 seems most promising as it eliminates Black's strong bishop and weakens their kingside dark squares. The exchange 14. Bxh6 gxh6 would give White a structural advantage and open the g-file for potential rook play.\n- c3d5 is also interesting but after 14. Nxd5 Qxd5, Black's queen becomes very active and White doesn't gain much.\n- d1d3 is solid but doesn't address the immediate imbalance of Black's strong bishop.\nThe best move is to trade off Black's dangerous bishop with:\n```\ne3h6\n```"
