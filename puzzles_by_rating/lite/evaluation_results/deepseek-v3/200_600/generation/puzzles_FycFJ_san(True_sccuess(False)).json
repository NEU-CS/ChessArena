When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n4. White has a passed c-pawn that could become dangerous\n5. Black's rook on e8 is under attack from White's bishop on f4\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Bxe5, winning the exchange\n- Black needs to either protect the rook or move it to safety\n- Moving the king (Kh8/Kf8) doesn't solve the problem\n- Rxe5 is possible but leads to an inferior endgame after dxe5\n- The best option seems to be moving the rook to a safer square while maintaining control\nAfter considering several options:\n- Re7 looks passive and allows White to continue improving position\n- Re6 blocks the bishop but leaves the rook exposed\n- Rf8 is interesting but allows Bxe5 anyway after f6\n- Red8 seems most active, keeping the rook connected and controlling the d-file\nThe move Red8:\n- Protects the rook from Bxe5\n- Maintains rook activity\n- Prepares potential counterplay along the d-file\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\nOther moves either lose material or lead to passive positions. Therefore, the best move is:\n```\nRed8\n```"
