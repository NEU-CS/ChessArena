When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Rook, Bishop vs Rook, Bishop). White has doubled rooks on the b-file.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on a6\n- Black has a strong bishop on d4 attacking our rook on b2\n- Our bishop on e3 is blocked by our own pawn on f2\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b8: Rook lift to attack the king along the 8th rank\n- e3d4: Trading bishops to relieve pressure\n- b2d2: Protecting the bishop and centralizing the rook\n- a4a5: Pushing the passed pawn\n4. Analysis of b2b8:\n- After b2b8, Black can play Rd8 pinning our rook\n- But then we can play Rb6+! Ka7 Rxd8 winning material\n- Even if Black tries Rxb8, we have Rxb8 with threats against the king\n5. Other moves:\n- e3d4 is tempting but after Bxd4 Rxd4, Black has Rc1+ winning our rook\n- b2d2 is solid but doesn't create threats\n- a4a5 is slow and Black can counterattack\nThe most forcing and strongest move is b2b8, creating immediate threats against Black's exposed king while maintaining our material advantage. Black has no good way to defend against the coming Rb6+.\n```\nb2b8\n```"
