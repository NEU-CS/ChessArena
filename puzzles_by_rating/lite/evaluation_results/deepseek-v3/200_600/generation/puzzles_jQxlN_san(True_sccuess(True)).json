If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Looking at the board:\n   - White has a strong attacking position with queen on h5 and knight on f6\n   - Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous\n   - White has threats like Qxh6 or Nxg7+\n   - Black has two legal moves: Kf8 or Bxf6\nOption 1: Kf8\n- Gets the king out of immediate danger\n- But allows White to play Qxh6 with a strong attack\n- The position remains very dangerous for Black\nOption 2: Bxf6\n- Takes the dangerous knight\n- After Bxf6, White would likely recapture with Qxf6\n- This removes the immediate threats (no more Nxg7+ or Qxh6)\n- Black can then try to develop and castle next move\n- The position becomes more balanced\nBetween these, Bxf6 is clearly better as it eliminates White's most dangerous attacking piece and relieves the immediate pressure. Kf8 would leave Black in a very precarious position.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBxf6\n```"
