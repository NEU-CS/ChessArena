When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (rook, rook, bishop vs rook, rook, bishop). Black has a queen vs White's queen.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g5\n- White's queen is somewhat exposed on e2\n- Black has doubled rooks on the e-file\n- White has a weak pawn on d4 that could be targeted\n- Black's c6 knight is well-placed to jump into d4 or other squares\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5e3: Forking queen and bishop, but White can defend with Qxe3\n- c6d4: Attacking the weak d4 pawn and eyeing e2\n- e8e7: Doubling rooks on the e-file to increase pressure\n- g5h4: Moving queen to a safer square while maintaining pressure\n4. After deeper analysis:\n- c6d4 looks very strong as it attacks the d4 pawn and threatens to jump into e2\n- After c6d4, if White defends with Qd2, then Black can play Qh4 with strong threats\n- If White takes the knight with exd4, then exd4 opens the e-file for Black's rooks\n5. Other options like g5e7 or g5h6 don't seem as forcing or don't create immediate threats.\nThe most forcing and promising move appears to be c6d4, putting immediate pressure on White's position.\n```\nc6d4\n```"
