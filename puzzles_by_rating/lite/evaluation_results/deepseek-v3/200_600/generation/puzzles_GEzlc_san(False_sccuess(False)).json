When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns vs Black's Queen, Rook, 2 pawns. Material is roughly equal (Black's queen vs White's rook+bishop).\n2. Key features:\n- White has doubled rooks on the c-file\n- Black's queen is very active on d5\n- White's bishop is somewhat restricted by its own pawn on c6\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4 that could become dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3a7: Queen trade, but after Qxa7 Rxa7, Black's rook becomes very active\n- e3e4: Taking the pawn, but Qxe4 leaves White's queen exposed to attacks\n- c2c5: Challenging the black queen, but Qxc5 Bxc5 leaves White with bishop vs rook\n- b8 moves: The rook is currently trapped, but b8b7 looks interesting to free it\n- c6c7: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's blockaded by Black's rook\n4. Best options:\n- b8b7 is tempting to free the rook, but after ...Qd1+ it leads to complications\n- e3d4 seems strong, attacking the queen while defending e4\n- c2c5 is interesting as it forces a queen trade that might be favorable\nAfter deeper analysis, e3d4 seems most promising:\n- It attacks the queen while defending e4\n- After Qxd4, cxd4 leaves White with better piece coordination\n- If Black moves the queen away, White maintains pressure\nThe move also prevents any immediate threats from Black's queen while improving White's position.\n```\ne3d4\n```"
