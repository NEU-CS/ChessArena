If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e5\n- Black's rook on a2 is threatening the b2 pawn\n- Black's dark-squared bishop on b5 is pinning the b2 pawn to the rook on a1\n- White's bishop on g5 is very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxb5: Wins a bishop but after ...axb5, Black's rook on a2 would be very strong\n- Bxf6: Eliminates a defender of Black's king, but after ...Bxf6 White's queen is overloaded\n- Rxa2: Seems tempting to eliminate the immediate threat, but after ...Bxa2 the b2 pawn falls\n- Bh6: A strong move threatening to weaken Black's kingside\nAfter careful consideration, Bh6 is the most promising:\n- It threatens to exchange the dark-squared bishop which is a key defender of Black's king\n- After Bh6 Bxh6 Qxh6, White's queen penetrates to h6 with strong attacking chances\n- Black cannot easily defend against the threats to f7 and h7\n- Even if Black doesn't take the bishop, Bh6 creates serious kingside weaknesses\nOther moves either don't create enough threats or allow Black counterplay. Bh6 maintains the initiative and increases pressure on Black's position.\n```\nBh6\n```"
