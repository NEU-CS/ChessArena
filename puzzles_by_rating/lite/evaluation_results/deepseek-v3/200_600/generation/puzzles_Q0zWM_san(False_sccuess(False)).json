When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: White's king is safe on g2. Black's king is on f5, somewhat exposed but not immediately threatened.\n3. Pawn structure: White has a passed pawn on e3 and a pawn on g3. Black has a pawn on e4.\n4. Immediate threats: Black's knight on d1 is threatening to fork the king and rook if it moves to f2. \n5. Rook activity: The rook on b5 is very active and should be used to either:\n   - Support the pawn advance\n   - Attack the black king\n   - Prevent counterplay\nKey observations:\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- The g-pawn is preventing the black king from advancing further\n- We need to be careful about knight forks\nCandidate moves:\n1. b5f5 - Rook checks the king, forcing it to move\n   - After Kxf5, we have Kf3 winning the e4 pawn\n   - But then Black has Nf2 fork\n   - Not clearly winning\n2. b5b8 - Rook goes to the 8th rank\n   - Controls the back rank\n   - Prepares to swing to f8 or h8\n   - But gives Black time to activate knight\n3. g3g4 - Pawn advance\n   - Creates a passed pawn\n   - Forces the black king to retreat (Ke5)\n   - Then Rb5+ Kf6, and we can push g5+\n   - This seems most promising\n4. b5e5 - Rook attacks the pawn\n   - Black can play Ke5 defending\n   - Not making progress\nAfter careful consideration, g3g4 seems strongest as it:\n- Creates a passed pawn\n- Forces the black king back\n- Maintains all our advantages\n- Limits Black's counterplay\nThe move g3g4 leads to a winning position where we can create a second passed pawn and use our king to support them.\n```\ng3g4\n```"
