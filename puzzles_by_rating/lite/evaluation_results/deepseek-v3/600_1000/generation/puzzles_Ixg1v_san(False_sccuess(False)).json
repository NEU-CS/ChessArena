When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that's quite dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on e2 that can promote\n- White's bishop controls important squares\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White threatens f6-f7, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- Black's e2 pawn can promote, but needs to be timed correctly\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e2e1q: Promoting immediately, but after Rxe1, Black loses the pawn\n- c1c4: Pinning the bishop, but White can play Bxc4 Rxc4 and still push f7\n- g6g5: Moving the king away from potential checks, but allows f6-f7\n- h5h4: Pushing the pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n5. Best move seems to be c1c4, pinning the bishop:\n- After Bxc4 Rxc4, White can play f7, but then Black has e2e1q Rxe1 Rxf4 with counterplay\n- This seems better than allowing White to push f7 immediately\nThe move c1c4 creates the most complications and counterplay opportunities.\n```\nc1c4\n```"
