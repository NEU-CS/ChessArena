Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Black has queen, 2 rooks and pawn vs White's 2 rooks and queen. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key threats:\n- White has a rook on b7 attacking the pawn on a7\n- White's queen on h3 is eyeing the black king\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n3. Candidate moves evaluation:\n- Kg8: Gets the king away from immediate threats, but leaves the rook on e8 hanging to White's rook on b8\n- Kf8: Similar to Kg8, but may allow White to play Qh8+ next\n- Kg6: Puts the king on a safer square, but allows Qh5+ forcing the king to f6 where it's more exposed\n- R8e7: Defends the rook on e6 but leaves the a7 pawn undefended\n- R6e7: Same as above\n- Qc7: Defends the a7 pawn and connects the rooks, but allows White to play Rb8xe8 winning the exchange\n4. Best option seems Qc7:\n- It defends the a7 pawn which is under attack\n- It connects the rooks, improving coordination\n- After Rb8xe8 Rxe8, Black can play Re7 defending the remaining rook\n- White's immediate threats are neutralized\nOther moves either lose material or leave the king too exposed. Qc7 maintains material balance while improving piece coordination.\n```\nQc7\n```"
