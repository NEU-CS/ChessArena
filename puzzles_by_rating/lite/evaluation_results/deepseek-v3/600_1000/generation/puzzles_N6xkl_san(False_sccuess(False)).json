When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully.\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a rook on f7, bishop on e5, queen on e2, pawns on d3/d4/g3, king on h2\n2. Black has king on c8, rook on g8, queen on g5, pawns on a7/b7/d5/h6/h3\n3. Black's queen is attacking White's bishop on e5\n4. White's rook on f7 is very active and threatening\n5. Black's h-pawn is advanced to h3, creating some threats near White's king\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rook moves: f7f8 looks tempting to double on the f-file\n2. Bishop moves: e5g7 attacks the queen while defending the rook\n3. Queen moves: e2h5 could be interesting to exchange queens\n4. King moves: h2h3 to deal with the pawn threat\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e5g7 seems strong as it defends the rook while attacking the queen\n- f7f8 is also good, creating threats on the back rank\n- e2h5 leads to queen exchange which might simplify into a favorable endgame\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be e5g7, which:\n1. Attacks the queen\n2. Defends the rook on f7\n3. Maintains all of White's threats\n4. If queen takes bishop (g5xg7), then f7xg7 wins material\n5. If queen moves away, White maintains strong pressure\nOther moves like f7f8 allow Black counterplay with h3h2+.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5g7\n```"
