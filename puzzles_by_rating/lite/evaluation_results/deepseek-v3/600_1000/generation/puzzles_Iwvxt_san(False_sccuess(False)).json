When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b7 is very dangerous, threatening to promote\n- Black's queen on d5 is centralized but somewhat exposed\n- White's knight on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with weak pawns around it\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7c8 (queen takes rook with check) - this looks very promising\n- e5f7 (knight fork of king and rook)\n- e5g6 (attacking the f-pawn and eyeing h5 pawn)\n4. Deep analysis of b7c8:\n- b7xc8+ forces Kf8 (only legal move)\n- Then we can play e5f7+ forking king and queen\n- Black would have to move king (Ke7 or Kg8)\n- Either way, we win the queen with f7xd5\n5. Other moves:\n- e5f7 immediately allows Qxe5 in reply\n- e5g6 is less forcing and gives Black counterplay\n- Any queen move other than b7c8 allows Black to defend better\n6. Conclusion: b7c8 is the most forcing and winning move, leading to a decisive material advantage.\nHere's the move:\n```\nb7c8\n```"
