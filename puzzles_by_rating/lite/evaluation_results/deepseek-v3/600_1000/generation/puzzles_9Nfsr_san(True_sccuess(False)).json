When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

King safety:\n- White's king is on h2, somewhat exposed\n- Black's king is on h7, also exposed but slightly better protected\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White has Qd8+ threatening to win the rook\n- Black's queen is attacking g3 pawn but it's defended by the rook\n- White's rook on g3 is very active\nNow let's examine the candidate moves:\n1. Kf7:\n- Gets out of the pin but allows Qd7+ winning the rook\n- Bad move\n2. Kh6:\n- Gets out of the pin but allows Qh8+ winning the rook\n- Also bad\n3. Qg5:\n- Attacks the rook but allows Qh8+ winning the rook\n- Doesn't solve our problems\n4. Qxg3+:\n- This is the only move that doesn't immediately lose material\n- After Qxg3+ Kxg3, we have equal material (R vs R)\n- The resulting rook endgame should be drawn with accurate play\n- White's king is slightly more active but Black's pawn structure is better\nThe best move is to trade queens into a drawn rook endgame:\n```\nQxg3+\n```"
