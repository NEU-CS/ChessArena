When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- Black has: king, rook, bishop, rook, bishop, pawns\n- White has: king, queen, bishop, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (Black has rook vs White's queen, but White's queen is very active)\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very strong, eyeing the black king\n- Black's rooks are active but not coordinated\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxh5, winning a pawn\n- White also has potential for Qf6+ ideas\n- Black needs to address these threats while improving his position\n4. Candidate moves:\na) King moves (g8f8/g8h7) - but this doesn't address threats\nb) Rook moves - c7c8 looks interesting to defend the back rank\nc) Bishop moves - f5g4 pins the g2 pawn\nd) f7f6 blocks the queen's diagonal but weakens e6\ne) b1b2 defends the bishop on a5\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f5g4 looks most promising as it pins the g2 pawn to the king, creating tactical possibilities\n- It also prevents White from playing g3 to defend against ...Qxh5 ideas\n- The pin could lead to future tactics involving the rook on b1\nOther options:\n- c7c8 is solid but passive\n- f7f6 weakens the e6 square too much\n- b1b2 doesn't address the immediate threats\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf5g4\n```"
