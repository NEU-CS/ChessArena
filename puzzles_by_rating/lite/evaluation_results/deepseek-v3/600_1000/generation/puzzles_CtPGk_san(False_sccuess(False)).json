When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook + rook vs White's queen + rook). However, White's queen is very active on e5, eyeing the g7 pawn and potentially threatening checks.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on e5 is very strong, attacking g7 and controlling key squares\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- Black has doubled rooks on the e-file, but White's queen blocks them\n- White has a bishop on e3 that could become active\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg7+ if not properly defended\n- White might try to coordinate queen and rook for an attack\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8e7: Moves the rook to defend g7, but blocks the other rook\n- g8h8: Moves the king to safety but gives up castling rights\n- f7f6: Creates luft for the king while challenging the queen\n- c7e7: Doubles rooks on the e-file, but leaves g7 vulnerable\n5. Best move seems to be f7f6:\n- Creates an escape square for the king at f7\n- Challenges the powerful queen on e5\n- Maintains the defense of g7\n- Doesn't block the rooks' activity\n- If White takes with Qxf6, then Rf8 gains tempo on the queen\nOther options have drawbacks:\n- e8e7 blocks the c7 rook\n- g8h8 is too passive\n- c7e7 leaves g7 vulnerable\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf7f6\n```"
