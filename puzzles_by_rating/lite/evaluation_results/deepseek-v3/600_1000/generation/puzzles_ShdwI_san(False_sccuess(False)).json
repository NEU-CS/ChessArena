When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n   - White has a strong knight on g5 and queen on h5, eyeing f7\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed with the h6 bishop pinning the g7 pawn\n   - Black's knight on d4 is well placed but potentially unstable\n   - White has pressure on the e-file with the rook on e1\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) h8g7 - This would unpin the g7 pawn but allow Bxg7 winning material\nB) d4f5 - Challenging White's strong knight on g5\nC) c7d6 - Protecting the e5 square and developing the queen\nD) e8f8 - Getting the king out of potential checks on the e-file\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- h8g7 is bad due to Bxg7 winning material\n- d4f5 looks interesting but after Nxf5 exf5, White's queen becomes very active\n- c7d6 seems solid, protecting e5 and keeping options open\n- e8f8 is probably safest, getting the king away from potential e-file threats\nThe best move appears to be e8f8, getting the king to safety while maintaining all options. This prevents any potential back rank issues and keeps the position flexible.\n```\ne8f8\n```"
