If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed a-pawn (a5)\n- Black has doubled rooks on the c-file (Rc8 and Rc2)\n- White's bishop is very active on d4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8\n- Black's bishop on d6 is blocking their own d-pawn\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bg7+ (immediate check, forcing king to move)\n- Rb8 (attacking the rook on c8)\n- Rf7+ (forcing king to move)\n- a6 (pushing the passed pawn)\n4. Analysis of Bg7+:\n- Bg7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n- Then Rb7+ forks king and bishop\n- After Kf8, Rxd6 wins a piece\n5. Analysis of Rb8:\n- Attacks the rook on c8\n- Black can defend with R2c7\n- Not as forcing as Bg7+\n6. Analysis of Rf7+:\n- Rf7+ Ke8\n- Then Bg7 is strong, but not as direct as Bg7+ first\n7. Analysis of a6:\n- Pushes the passed pawn\n- But misses the immediate tactical opportunity\nThe best move is clearly Bg7+, which wins material immediately by forking the king and bishop after the forced sequence.\n```\nBg7+\n```"
