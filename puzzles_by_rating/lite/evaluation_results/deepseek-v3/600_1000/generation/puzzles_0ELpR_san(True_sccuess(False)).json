If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's queen is very active, but White has two rooks which can be powerful if coordinated.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is centralized on c5, attacking b4 and e5\n- White has a passed f6 pawn that could be dangerous\n- Black's knight on g4 is unprotected but attacking f2\n- White's bishop on g2 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxe5: Seems tempting to win the bishop, but after Qxe5, Black's queen becomes even more active\n- Rxg4: Eliminates the knight threat, but after hxg4, Black gets open h-file\n- Qxg4: Also eliminates knight, but after hxg4, White loses the queen\n- Nc7: Forking queen and rook, but Qxc7 loses the knight\n- Nd6: Attacks queen and bishop, but Qxd6 is possible\n- Rf4: Defends f2 and prepares to double rooks on the e-file\nAfter careful consideration, Rf4 seems most prudent:\n- It defends against the knight threat on f2\n- Prepares to double rooks on the e-file\n- Maintains all of White's positional advantages\n- Doesn't give Black any counterplay\nOther moves either lose material or give Black too much activity. The position is complex, but Rf4 keeps White's advantage while limiting Black's options.\n```\nRf4\n```"
