If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very strong, eyeing both the b8-h2 diagonal and the e-file\n- Black's bishop on a5 is somewhat trapped\n- White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed with White's bishop on e2 eyeing the kingside\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qxh5 or Qf5+\n- Black needs to activate his pieces while keeping the position safe\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Rxc4: Wins a pawn but opens up the position dangerously with White's queen active\n- Rc5: Challenges the queen while activating the rook\n- Bb6: Gets the bishop out of danger and eyes d4\n- g5: Secures the h5 pawn but weakens f6\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rxc4 is too risky due to White's queen activity\n- g5 weakens the kingside too much\n- Bb6 is solid but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- Rc5 is the most active move, challenging the queen while activating the rook\nThe best move is:\n```\nRc5\n```"
