When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a bishop for White's knight, but otherwise balanced). However, White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g5 is very active and eyeing the g2 pawn\n- Black has a bishop on d3 attacking White's queen\n- White's queen is very active on c2\n- White has a strong central pawn on d4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with weak dark squares around it\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Black's bishop attacking our queen\n- Black could play Qxg2+ if we don't address it\n- We need to deal with the bishop while maintaining our activity\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Qxd3: Simplifies but gives up our active queen\n- Qe2: Protects g2 but blocks the e-file\n- Qd1: Retreats but seems passive\n- Qb3: Interesting, keeps queen active while moving away\n- Bg5: Pins the queen to the king\n- Rxe8: Could be considered but Black recaptures with rook\n5. Best options:\n- Bg5 looks very strong:\n  * Pins the queen to the king\n  * If Qxg5, then Qxd3 and we win a piece\n  * If Black moves queen away, we can consider Qxd3 next\n  * Creates immediate threats against Black's position\nAfter careful consideration, Bg5 seems the most forcing and strongest move, creating immediate threats while maintaining our active pieces.\n```\nc1g5\n```"
