When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e7) which is a concern\n3. Key features:\n   - White has a strong centralized queen on e4\n   - Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by pawns\n   - White's bishop on c4 is very active\n   - Black's rook on c8 is semi-active\nThe most pressing issues for Black:\n- Need to address the king safety\n- Need to develop the remaining pieces\n- Need to deal with White's strong central control\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e7e8 - Moving the king to safety but blocks the rook\n2. e7f7 - King moves towards the corner but exposes to potential checks\n3. c6e5 - Knight move attacking the queen while developing\n4. c6d4 - Knight centralization but may be vulnerable\n5. d8d7 - Queen moves to connect rooks but doesn't solve king safety\nBest options seem to be:\n- c6e5: Challenges the strong white queen while developing the knight\n- e7f7: Improves king safety by moving towards castling position\nAfter deeper consideration:\n- c6e5 looks most principled as it forces White to react to the threat against their queen\n- After Qxe5, Black can play f6xe5, opening the f-file for the rook and resolving the king safety issue\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc6e5\n```"
