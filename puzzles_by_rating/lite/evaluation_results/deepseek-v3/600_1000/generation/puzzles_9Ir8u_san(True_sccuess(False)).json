Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a slight positional advantage with more active pieces.\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g7 with White's bishop on h6 and rook on f4 putting pressure. The h6 bishop is currently hanging.\n3. Immediate threats: White has a discovered attack possibility with the knight on f6 - if it moves, the rook on f4 attacks the bishop on e6.\n4. Available moves:\n- Kh8: Gets the king to relative safety but allows White to take the bishop with Bxe6.\n- Kxh6: Captures the bishop but leaves the king very exposed on h6.\nAfter evaluating:\n- Kxh6 is too dangerous as after 1...Kxh6 2.Nxe6 White wins a piece.\n- Kh8 is the safer option, though after 1...Kh8 2.Bxe6 Rxe6 White still has some initiative.\nThe best practical chance is Kh8, getting the king to safety while maintaining material equality. The position remains complicated but at least the king is safer.\n```\nKh8\n```"
