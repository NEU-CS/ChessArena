If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has Rook on b7, Queen on f4, Rook on e1, Bishop on d2, Pawns on a2, g2, h3\n- Black has Rook on g8, Knight on g7, Queen on d7, Bishop on d5, Pawns on c6, e6, g6, King on f7\n2. Key observations:\n- White has a strong attack with the Queen on f4 eyeing f7 and the Rook on b7 pinning the Queen to the King\n- Black's King is exposed and under pressure\n- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n- The immediate threat is Qxf7+ winning the King\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxb7: This seems tempting but after Rxb7, Black loses material\n- Qe7: Defends f7 but allows White to play Qf6+ winning the Knight\n- Kf8: Gets out of the pin but leaves f7 vulnerable\n- g5: Pushes the pawn to block the Queen's diagonal\n- Rh7: Defends f7 but allows Qxg6\nAfter careful consideration, g5 seems like the best move because:\n- It blocks the Queen's attack on f7\n- It maintains material equality\n- It doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n- It keeps the King relatively safe\n- It prevents Qf6+ ideas\nOther moves either lose material or allow immediate threats. While g5 does weaken the dark squares slightly, it's the most practical way to defend against White's threats.\n```\ng5\n```"
