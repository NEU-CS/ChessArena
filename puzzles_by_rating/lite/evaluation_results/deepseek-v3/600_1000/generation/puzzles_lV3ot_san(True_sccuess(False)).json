When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e3\n- Black's rook on a2 is very active\n- White has connected passed pawns on c4 and f4\n- Black's pawn structure is somewhat compromised with doubled f-pawns\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to advance passed pawns\n- Black can create threats against White's king\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Ra3+ - checks the king and forces it to move\n- Rf2 - attacks the f4 pawn\n- Be4 - centralizes the bishop and eyes the f3 square\n- Bxg2 - wins a pawn but exposes the bishop\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Ra3+ seems most forcing, driving the king away from protecting pawns\n- After Ke4, Black can play Rf3 attacking the f4 pawn\n- Or after Kd3, Black can play Rb2 with threats\n- This keeps the initiative and prevents White from advancing pawns\nOther options:\n- Rf2 is good but allows White to defend with Kd3\n- Be4 is solid but not as forcing\n- Bxg2 gives up the bishop's activity for a pawn\nBest move is to check the king and maintain the initiative:\n```\nRa3+\n```"
