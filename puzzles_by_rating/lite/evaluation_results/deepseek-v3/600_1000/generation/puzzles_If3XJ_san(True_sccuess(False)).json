If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White is up a pawn but the position is very blocked.\n2. Key features:\n- White's b-pawn is passed but blocked by black's rook on b7\n- Black's king is active in the center\n- Both sides have pawn weaknesses\n- White's rook is currently very active on h6\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rd6+: Checks the king and forces it to move, but after Kc5 or Ke5, black's king becomes more active\n- Rxh5: Wins a pawn but opens the h-file for black's rook\n- Rg6: Attacks the g4 pawn and prepares to support the g3 pawn\n- f4: Challenges black's e5 pawn and opens lines\n4. Best move analysis:\n- Rxh5 seems tempting but after gxh5, black gets connected passed pawns which would be dangerous\n- Rd6+ leads to Kc5 and black's king becomes too active near the queenside pawns\n- f4 is interesting but after exf4 gxf4, black's g4 pawn becomes strong\n- Rg6 seems most solid, maintaining pressure on black's pawns while keeping the rook active\nAfter careful consideration, Rg6 is the most positional move, maintaining pressure on black's weaknesses while keeping white's structure intact.\n```\nRg6\n```"
