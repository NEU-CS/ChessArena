When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has Q, R, 2 pawns\n- Black has R, Q, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs rook)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is on h2, somewhat exposed\n- Black king is on h7, also exposed but slightly better protected\n3. Key threats:\n- White's queen on d8 is very active\n- White's rook on g3 is eyeing the g-file\n- Black's queen on e5 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\na) g7f7 - Moving king to f7 seems passive and doesn't address any threats\nb) g7h6 - Moving king to h6 is risky as it brings it closer to White's pieces\nc) e5g5 - Queen to g5 attacks the rook but allows Qd8h4+ winning the queen\nd) e5g3 - Queen takes rook is the most forcing move\nAfter calculating:\n- e5g3 Qxg3 Qd8h4+ Kh6 Qxh5+ Kg7 Qg5+ Kf7 Qxg3\nThis leads to a queen vs queen endgame where Black is down a pawn but has connected passed pawns on the queenside\nThe other moves either lose material immediately or lead to worse positions. While e5g3 leads to a slightly worse endgame, it's the best practical chance as other moves lose immediately.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5g3\n```"
