When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong central presence with pawn on e4 and bishop on c4 eyeing f7\n3. Black's position is somewhat cramped with pawns on a4 and g6\n4. White's queen on f3 is very active, potentially threatening Qxf7# if not careful\nKey considerations:\n- Need to develop pieces while being mindful of White's threats\n- The f7 pawn is vulnerable to Bxf7+ or Qxf7+ tricks\n- Need to castle soon for king safety\n- Should consider challenging White's center\nCandidate moves:\n1. g8f6 - Develops knight to natural square, but allows Bxf7+ winning the rook\n2. f8g7 - Solid development, prepares to castle, but doesn't address immediate threats\n3. d7d6 - Solid move, supports e5 push, but slow\n4. e7e6 - Blocks bishop, but weakens d6 square\n5. b8c6 - Develops knight, but allows Bxf7+ tricks\nAfter careful consideration, f8g7 seems best because:\n- It develops the bishop to a good diagonal\n- Prepares to castle quickly\n- Doesn't fall for any immediate tactics\n- Maintains flexibility in the position\nThe move also prevents any Bxf7+ tricks since after Bxf7+ Kxf7 Qxf7+ would be met with Kg7 protecting the queen.\n```\nf8g7\n```"
