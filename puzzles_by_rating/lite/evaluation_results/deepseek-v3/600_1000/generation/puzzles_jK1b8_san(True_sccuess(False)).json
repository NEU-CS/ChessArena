When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on a4 is eyeing the f7 pawn and has potential checks\n- Black's queen on b6 is well placed but needs to be careful about checks\n- White has a passed a-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qd7+ next move, attacking the king and f7 pawn\n- White's h-pawn is advancing which could create threats\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qb7: Defends the f7 pawn while keeping the queen active\n- Qf6+: Checks the king and forces it to move\n- Qxa6+: Wins a pawn but allows White counterplay\n- Kh7: Gets the king off the g-file where checks may come\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qf6+ looks tempting but after Kf1, White can play Qd7 next with threats\n- Qxa6+ wins material but after Qd7+ the position becomes messy\n- Kh7 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- Qb7 is the most flexible, defending f7 while keeping options open\nThe best move is:\n```\nQb7\n```"
