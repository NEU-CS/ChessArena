When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king, bishop, rook, 2 pawns\n- White has: king, rook, bishop, 2 pawns\nMaterial is equal (both sides have rook + bishop + 2 pawns)\n2. Positional factors:\n- Black's rook on c4 is very active and controls the 4th rank\n- White's rook on a7 is somewhat passive\n- Black's bishop on f6 is strong, eyeing the white king\n- White's bishop on f2 is blocked by its own pawn on g3\n- White's king is very exposed on h1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g8\n3. Threats and opportunities:\n- Black can consider activating the rook further or attacking the weak white king\n- The h7 pawn is vulnerable to potential future attacks\n- White's pawn structure has weaknesses (isolated c-pawn, backward g-pawn)\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Rook moves: c4h4 looks tempting, attacking h2 and bringing the rook closer to the white king\nb) Bishop moves: f6h4 could be strong, pinning the g3 pawn\nc) King moves: g8h8/g8f8 are safe but don't accomplish much\nd) Pawn moves: h7h5/g7g5 could be considered to create luft\nAfter careful consideration, f6h4 seems most promising:\n- It pins the g3 pawn to the king\n- If White moves the king, we can capture g3 next move\n- It maintains pressure on the position\n- It prevents White from playing g3-g4 to free their bishop\nOther moves like c4h4 are also good, but f6h4 creates more immediate threats.\n```\nf6h4\n```"
