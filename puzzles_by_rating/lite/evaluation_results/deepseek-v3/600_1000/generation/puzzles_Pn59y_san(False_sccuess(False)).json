When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen and rook. White is up a knight, which is a significant advantage.\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover. White's king is relatively safe on g1.\n3. Key features:\n   - White's queen on g4 is very active, eyeing the black king.\n   - White's rook on b7 is pinning the f7 pawn to the black rook on f8.\n   - White's knight on e7 is extremely powerful, controlling key squares near the black king.\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e7g8: Knight sacrifice to expose the black king\n   - g4g7: Direct queen attack threatening mate\n   - b7d7: Rook move to defend the knight and maintain pressure\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e7g8 is tempting but after ...Rxg8, White has Qh5+ Kg7 Qh7+ Kf6 and Black might escape.\n- g4g7 is very strong as it threatens Qh7#. Black's only defense is Qxg7, but then Nxg7 Kxg7, and White wins material with Rb7+ followed by Rxa5.\n- Other moves don't capitalize on the immediate attacking potential.\nThe most forcing and decisive move is g4g7, which leads to immediate material gain or mate threats.\n```\ng4g7\n```"
