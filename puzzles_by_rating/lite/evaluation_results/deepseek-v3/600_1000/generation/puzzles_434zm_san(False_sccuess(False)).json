When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, R, 2 pawns\n- Black has: R, R, Q, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's king is exposed.\n2. King safety:\n- White king is on f2, very exposed to checks\n- Black has queen on h4 and rook on e3 attacking f3 pawn\n- Black's queen and rook can deliver multiple checks\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black can play Qh2+ next move if we don't prevent it\n- Black's rook on e3 is attacking our f3 pawn\n- Black's queen is eyeing our king\n4. Available moves:\n- f2g1: Gets the king to slightly safer square but still vulnerable\n- f2f1: Puts king on f1, still in danger from checks\n- g2g3: Blocks the queen's path to h2 but opens up other problems\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g2g3 seems most principled as it prevents Qh2+\n- However, after g2g3, Black can play Qh3 with strong pressure\n- f2g1 is probably better as it keeps the pawn structure intact and removes the king from immediate danger\n- f2f1 is similar but leaves the king more cramped\nBest move is to move the king to g1 where it has more squares to escape future checks:\n```\nf2g1\n```"
