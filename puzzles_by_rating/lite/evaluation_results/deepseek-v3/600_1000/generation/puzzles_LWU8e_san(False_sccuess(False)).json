When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n   - White has Q+R vs Black's Q+Q+R+R (Black is up a queen and rook)\n3. King positions:\n   - White king on a2 (very exposed)\n   - Black king on b8 (somewhat exposed but better than White's)\n4. Key threats:\n   - Black has two queens and two rooks vs White's queen and rook\n   - White's queen on a5 is threatening the rook on d8\n   - Black has multiple mating threats available\nLooking at the position, Black has several forced mates available. The most straightforward is:\n1. Qg1 (g3g1) threatens mate on a1\n2. White has no way to prevent this - any move of the white queen allows Qxa1# immediately\n3. Even if White tries Qxd8+, Black can simply recapture with Kxd8 and still mate next move\nOther candidate moves like Qh1a1 would also work, but Qg1 is most direct.\nHere's the forced mate sequence:\n- g3g1 (threatening Qxa1#)\n- White has no useful checks or blocks\n- Next move will be Qxa1# regardless of what White does\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng3g1\n```"
