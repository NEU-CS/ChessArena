When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Let's evaluate:\nKey features:\n1. Black's king is exposed at g7\n2. White has two rooks on the 7th rank (b7 and b8)\n3. White's queen at h3 is eyeing the black king\n4. Black has a queen at e5 and rooks at e8 and e6\n5. Black's pawn structure is weak with pawns at a7, f6, g5\nLet's examine the legal moves:\n1. g7g8 - King moves to g8. This seems passive and allows White to continue attacking.\n2. g7f8 - King moves to f8. Similar to g8, still very passive.\n3. g7g6 - King moves to g6. This looks dangerous as it brings the king closer to White's pieces.\n4. e8e7 - Rook moves to e7. This might defend against some threats but doesn't solve the main problems.\n5. e6e7 - Rook moves to e7. Similar to above, but now the e6 rook is no longer controlling the e-file.\n6. e5c7 - Queen moves to c7. This is interesting as it defends the a7 pawn and creates a potential discovered attack.\nAfter careful consideration, e5c7 seems the most promising:\n- It defends the a7 pawn which is under attack from b7\n- It creates a potential discovered attack along the e-file if White takes on a7\n- It keeps the queen active and centralized\n- It prevents immediate mate threats\nThe other moves either leave Black's position too passive or allow White to continue building pressure. While the position remains difficult, e5c7 offers the most resistance.\nHere's the move:\n```\ne5c7\n```"
