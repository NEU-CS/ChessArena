When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, queen, bishop vs White's rook, queen, knight). \n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is concerning. White has some pressure with the knight on e4 and queen on e2.\n3. Key observations:\n   - Black's bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling important squares\n   - White's knight on e4 is well placed but can be challenged\n   - Both sides have doubled rooks on the e-file\n   - Black has a passed pawn on e5 but it's currently blockaded\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e8g8 (castling) - would get the king to safety but leaves the e8 rook undefended\n   - d5e4 - trading the strong bishop for the knight, but this might relieve pressure\n   - e7f6 - queen move attacking the knight while developing\n   - f5f4 - pawn push to challenge White's pawn structure\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be e8g8 (castling). Here's why:\n- It gets the king to safety which is the most urgent need\n- It connects the rooks\n- It maintains all of Black's active pieces\n- It doesn't give White any immediate tactical opportunities\n- The alternatives either leave the king in danger or give up important pieces\nThe move e8g8 addresses the most critical issue in the position (king safety) while maintaining all of Black's positional advantages.\n```\ne8g8\n```"
