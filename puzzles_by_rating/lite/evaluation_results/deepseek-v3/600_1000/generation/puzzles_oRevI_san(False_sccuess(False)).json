When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed but Black's king is also exposed\n- Black's rook is on e8, controlling the e-file\n- White's rook on h7 is very active\n- Black has connected passed pawns on a5 and b6\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7e7: challenging the black rook directly\n- h7h8: potentially pinning the black rook\n- b3b4: advancing the queenside pawns\n- g2g4: creating a passed pawn on the kingside\n4. Analysis of h7e7:\n- After h7e7 e8e7, we have a pure pawn endgame\n- White's king is better placed than Black's\n- White's pawn structure is slightly better\n- This leads to a likely draw but with some winning chances\n5. Analysis of h7h8:\n- Pins the black rook to the king\n- Black would likely play e8h8, exchanging rooks\n- Again leads to a pawn endgame, similar to h7e7\n6. Analysis of b3b4:\n- Creates a passed pawn on b4\n- But allows Black to push a5-a4, creating a dangerous passer\n- Not the most forcing move\n7. Analysis of g2g4:\n- Creates a passed pawn but weakens the king\n- Black can respond with h4xg3, opening lines\n- Risky as it exposes the white king more\nAfter careful consideration, h7e7 is the most forcing move that leads to a favorable pawn endgame. While it may result in a draw, it's the safest path that maintains equality while keeping some winning chances due to White's better king position and pawn structure.\n```\nh7e7\n```"
