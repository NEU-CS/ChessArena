When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2, while Black's king is relatively safe on c7.\n3. Key features:\n- Black has connected passed pawns on b5 and c5\n- White has an advanced e5 pawn\n- Black's knight on h3 is very active and threatening\n- White's rook on d3 is active but needs targets\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g5: attacking the h3 knight and f6 pawn\n- d3d8: rook lift to threaten back rank\n- e5f6: pawn capture to open lines\n- g2g3: trying to block the h3 knight's influence\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- f3g5 looks tempting but after ...hxg5, Black's pawns become more dangerous\n- d3d8 is interesting but Black can defend with ...Re7\n- e5f6 exf6 opens the e-file but gives Black's rook more activity\n- g2g3 seems safest, blocking the knight's influence and preparing to bring the king to f3\nThe best move appears to be g2g3, as it:\n- Blocks the h3 knight's influence\n- Prepares to bring the king to f3 for more safety\n- Maintains flexibility in the position\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\nOther moves either allow Black's initiative to grow or create new weaknesses. While we're still worse, g2g3 is the most resilient move.\n```\ng2g3\n```"
