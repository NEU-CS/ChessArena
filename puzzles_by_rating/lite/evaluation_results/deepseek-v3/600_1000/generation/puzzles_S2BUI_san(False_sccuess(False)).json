When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (Q vs R+B), but White's queen is very active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very strong on b6, attacking the c7 rook and controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has doubled rooks on the e-file, but they're not immediately threatening\n- White has a passed g-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6c7 - wins the rook but allows Black counterplay with Re2+\n- g2a8 - bishop sacrifice to expose the king, but seems premature\n- b6b8 - threatens mate in 1 (Qh8#)\n- g2d5 - developing the bishop with tempo\n4. Calculating b6b8:\n- b6b8 threatens Qh8#\n- Black's only defense is Rxb8\n- After Rxb8, we have g2xb8 with discovered check from our bishop\n- Black must move the king (only to h7)\n- Then we can play g4g5 with a strong attack\n5. Calculating b6c7:\n- Wins the rook immediately, but after Rxc7, Re2+ is annoying\n- We'd have to play Kh1, then Black can play Bxc3 with counterplay\n6. Conclusion:\nb6b8 is the strongest move as it forces the exchange of queens for rooks while maintaining our attacking chances and keeping the initiative. The discovered check after Rxb8 Bxb8+ gives us a lasting advantage.\n```\nb6b8\n```"
