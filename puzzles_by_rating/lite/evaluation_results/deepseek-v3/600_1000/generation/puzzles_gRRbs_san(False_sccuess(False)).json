When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully.\nThe FEN shows it's White's turn (the \"w\" in the notation). The material is roughly equal but White has a slight advantage with the active king and bishop vs Black's king and knight. The pawn structure is asymmetrical.\nKey observations:\n1. White has a passed a-pawn (a5) which could be dangerous if advanced\n2. Black has a passed f-pawn (f4) that's close to promotion\n3. White's bishop controls important squares and can be very active\n4. Both kings are quite active in the center\nLooking at the legal moves:\n1. f5f6 - King moves forward, attacking the f4 pawn but allowing Black counterplay\n2. f5g5 - King moves sideways, not particularly useful\n3. f5e5 - King moves towards center, but doesn't accomplish much\n4. f5g4 - King moves towards Black's pawn, but f4 pawn is more dangerous\n5. f5f4 - King captures the f4 pawn immediately, but after ...Nxf4, Black's knight becomes active\n6. f5e4 - King retreats, not ideal when we have the initiative\n7. b4e7 - Bishop sacrifice to eliminate Black's knight, which is their best defensive piece\nThe most promising move is b4e7 - sacrificing the bishop to remove Black's knight. After:\n- If ...Kxe7, then a6 and White's a-pawn becomes very dangerous\n- If ...Nxe7, then Kxf4 and White's king can support the a-pawn's advance\n- Black has no good way to decline the sacrifice\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous continuation. The bishop sacrifice disrupts Black's coordination and accelerates White's passed pawn.\n```\nb4e7\n```"
