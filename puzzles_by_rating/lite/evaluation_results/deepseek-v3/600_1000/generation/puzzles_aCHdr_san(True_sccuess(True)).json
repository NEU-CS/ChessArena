King safety:\n- White's king is exposed on e2 with no pawn cover in front.\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g8.\n3. Piece activity:\n- Black's bishop on c5 is very active, eyeing f2.\n- Black's knight on e4 is centralized but threatened by White's pawn on d3.\n- White's rook on g1 is active on the open g-file.\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Ng5: Attacks f3 square and prepares to jump to e6 or h3. But doesn't create immediate threats.\n- Ng3+: More forcing move that checks the king and forks the rook on g1 after Kf2 Nxh1.\nLooking deeper:\nAfter Ng3+:\n- If Kf2 Nxh1 wins the rook\n- If Ke1 Nxh1 also wins the rook\n- If Kd2?? Bf2+ wins the queen\nThe knight check is very strong as it either wins the rook or creates serious mating threats. The alternative Ng5 is less forcing and gives White time to consolidate.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nNg3+\n```"
