When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Bishop, Queen, Rook vs Black's Rook, Bishop, Queen. Material is equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g3, attacking g2 and h3\n- White's rook on a7 is very strong, potentially threatening the 7th rank\n- Black's bishop on e5 is well placed, controlling important squares\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7h7: Rook lift to attack the black king along the 7th rank\n- e2g4: Queen move to defend g2 and attack black's queen\n- d1d8: Rook lift to the 8th rank with potential threats\n- e3h6: Bishop move to attack black's queen\n4. Best move analysis:\n- a7h7 looks very strong as it:\n  - Attacks the black rook on f8\n  - Pins the black rook to the king\n  - Prepares potential mating threats with queen support\n  - Black cannot take the rook due to Qxh7+ winning the rook\n  - After ...Rf7, White can play Qe8+ with a winning attack\nOther moves like e2g4 allow Black to maintain pressure, while d1d8 is less forcing. e3h6 is interesting but Black can simply move the queen.\nThe most forcing and strongest move is a7h7, creating immediate threats against Black's king while maintaining all of White's positional advantages.\n```\na7h7\n```"
