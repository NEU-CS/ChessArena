When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is on g8, white's king is on g2.\n3. Black has a rook on d8, white has a rook on d2.\n4. White has pawns on g4 and h3, black has pawns on a7, b7, f7, h6.\nPotential threats:\n- White's queen and bishop are aligned towards black's king\n- White's rook could potentially become active\n- Black's queen is very active and can create threats\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5e7 - Queen checks the king while attacking the rook\n2. c5f8 - Bishop moves to defend the king\n3. d8f8 - Rook moves to defend the king\n4. g5h4 - Queen checks the king\nLet me evaluate these:\n1. g5e7+:\n   - Forces white to respond to check\n   - After Ke1 or Kf1, black can follow up with threats\n   - Also attacks the rook on d2\n   - White would likely play Qe2 to block, but then we can capture the rook\n2. c5f8:\n   - Solid defensive move but doesn't create threats\n   - Allows white to consolidate\n3. d8f8:\n   - Also defensive but less active than g5e7\n4. g5h4+:\n   - Forces Kh2\n   - Then we can play Qxh3+ winning a pawn\n   - But this seems less forcing than g5e7\nAfter careful consideration, g5e7+ seems strongest as it:\n- Gives check\n- Attacks the rook\n- Maintains initiative\n- Creates immediate threats\nWhite's best response would likely be Qe2, after which we can take the rook with Qxd2.\nHere's the move:\n```\ng5e7\n```"
