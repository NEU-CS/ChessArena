When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (Rooks vs Queen), but positionally White has some initiative.\n2. Key features:\n- White has connected passed pawns on the kingside (f4, g4)\n- Black's queen is very active on c7\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4\n- White's rooks are well placed on the e and f files\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3e7: Challenging the black queen while attacking the g7 pawn\n- g4g5: Advancing the passed pawn\n- f4f5: Another pawn push\n- b2b3: Dealing with the b4 pawn\n4. Analysis:\n- e3e7 looks very strong as it forces the queen to move or exchange, and after Qxe7 Rxe7, White's rooks become very active and can support the pawn advances.\n- g4g5 immediately is also good, but Black's queen can create counterplay.\n- f4f5 is less precise as it doesn't address the queen's activity.\n- b2b3 is too slow and allows Black to consolidate.\n5. Best continuation:\nAfter e3e7 Qxe7 Rxe7, White can push the g-pawn with g4g5 next, creating strong passed pawns that will be hard to stop. The king can then support the pawns while the rook cuts off Black's king.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne3e7\n```"
