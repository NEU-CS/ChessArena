When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rooks, minor pieces and pawns)\n2. Black's pieces are quite active:\n   - Bishop on g4 is pinning the knight to the queen\n   - Rooks are connected on the 8th rank\n   - Bishop on d6 is well placed\n3. White has pressure on the d-file with queen on d4 and rook on d1\n4. White's knight is pinned and vulnerable\n5. Black's king is slightly exposed but not in immediate danger\nKey observations:\n- The pin on the knight is very strong\n- White's queen on d4 is a bit loose\n- Black can consider moves that maintain pressure while improving piece coordination\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d8f6 - attacking the queen while developing the rook\n2. g4f3 - maintaining the pin and potentially winning material\n3. d6e5 - challenging the queen and opening lines\n4. b8b7 - preparing to double rooks on the d-file\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- d8f6 looks tempting but after Qxf6 Bxf3, White gets some compensation\n- g4f3 is strong as it maintains the pin and threatens to win the knight\n- After g4f3, if White tries Qxd5, Black can play Bxf3 and then Rxd5 with advantage\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be g4f3, maintaining the pin and threatening to win material. White has no good way to defend both the knight and the d5 pawn.\n```\ng4f3\n```"
