If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, pawn. Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h2 while Black's king is on c8. Black's pawn on h3 is a potential threat.\n3. Key observations:\n- White's rook on f7 is very active\n- Black's queen on g5 is unprotected\n- Black's rook on g8 is tied to defending the back rank\n- White's bishop on e5 is strong\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rf8+: Forcing the king to move, but after ...Kd7, Black's king might find safety\n- Rg7: Attacking the queen while defending g2\n- Qh5: Counter-attacking Black's queen\n- Qg4+: Forcing the queen trade\n- Bg7: Forking queen and rook\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- Rg7 looks strong as it attacks the queen while defending g2. If Qxg7, then Bxg7 wins the queen.\n- Qg4+ forces the queens off: Qxg4 Bxg4 and White has a slight edge in the endgame.\n- Bg7 is tempting but after Qxg7 Rf8+ Kd7 Rf7+ Ke8, Black can defend.\nThe most forcing and advantageous line appears to be Rg7:\n- If Qxg7, then Bxg7 Rxg7 and White is up a bishop for pawn\n- If Q moves away, White can consider Rf8+ next move\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRg7\n```"
