When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- Black has king, rook and pawns (e7, d6, f5, h5, g6)\n- White has king, rook, 2 bishops and pawns (d5, g3, h4)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank\n- White has two bishops pointing at Black's king\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- Black's pawn structure is somewhat compromised with isolated pawns\n- White's passed d-pawn could become dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Rxb1 winning the rook\n- White could also play Bxd6 or Bxe7 in some lines\n- Black needs to defend the b1 rook while maintaining counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Rg1+: Checks the king, but after Kf3 Black has no follow-up\n- Rxb6: Seems tempting but after Bxb6 White has strong bishops\n- Rb2: Defends the rook while keeping some activity\n- e6: Creates counterplay by opening the position\n- Kg7: Improves king safety\nAfter careful consideration, Rb2 seems most prudent:\n- It defends the rook on b1\n- Maintains some rook activity on the 2nd rank\n- Doesn't allow White to simplify into a favorable bishop endgame\n- Keeps options for counterplay with ...e6 or ...g5 later\nOther moves either lose material or allow White too much initiative.\n```\nRb2\n```"
