When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: rook (f8), rook (c8), bishop (c4), pawns (a7, e3, h6), king (h7)\n- White has: queen (a5), rook (f5), pawns (g2, h3), king (h1)\n- Black is up a bishop and pawn, but White has active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen and rook are very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- White's pawn on g2 could become dangerous if advanced\n- Black's bishop is very strong, controlling many squares\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qa5xc7 winning the rook\n- White also has potential threats like Rf5-f7+\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c8c7: defends against Qxc7 but blocks the bishop\n- c4a6: attacks the queen while developing the bishop\n- f8f7: defends against Rf7+ but leaves c7 undefended\n- c4f7: blocks potential Rf7+ while keeping the bishop active\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c4a6 looks tempting but after Qxa6 Rxa6, White gets two rooks for the queen which might be okay for them\n- c8c7 is solid but passive\n- c4f7 is the most flexible, blocking the rook's check potential while keeping all options open\nThe best move is:\n```\nc4f7\n```\nThis move:\n1. Blocks any potential rook checks on f7\n2. Keeps the bishop active and centralized\n3. Doesn't create any weaknesses\n4. Maintains all defensive options\n5. Doesn't give White any tactical opportunities"
