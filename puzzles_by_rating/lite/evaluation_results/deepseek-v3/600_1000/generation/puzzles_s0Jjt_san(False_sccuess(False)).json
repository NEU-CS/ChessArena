When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: rook, queen, pawns (a6, b5, c4, f7, g7, h7)\n- White has: queen, 2 rooks, knight, pawns (a2, g2, h2)\n- Material is roughly equal (Black has Q+R vs White's Q+R+R+N, but Black has more pawns)\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has strong pressure with rook on e5 and queen on d7\n- Black's c5 queen is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's knight on g3 is well placed\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qd7xf7+ winning the pawn\n- Also potential for Re5xe6 exploiting the pinned e6 pawn\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 - moves king to safer corner but still vulnerable\n- c5e7 - blocks the e-file and defends f7 pawn\n- a8e8 - connects rooks and defends e6 indirectly\n- c5d6 - centralizes queen while defending e6\n5. Best move seems to be c5e7:\n- Blocks the e-file pin on e6 pawn\n- Defends the f7 pawn against Qxf7+\n- Maintains queen's central position\n- Allows potential future ...Qf6 to challenge white's rook\nOther options:\n- g8h8 doesn't address the immediate threats\n- a8e8 leaves f7 pawn vulnerable\n- c5d6 allows Re5xe6\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\nc5e7\n```"
