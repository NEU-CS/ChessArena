When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has Rook + 4 pawns vs Black's Knight + 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more valuable than the knight in this endgame.\n2. King safety: Both kings are exposed but White's king is slightly more active.\n3. Pawn structure: White has a passed e-pawn while Black has connected passed pawns on the queenside.\nKey observations:\n- Black's knight is well-placed on d3, controlling key squares\n- White's rook is currently passive on h1\n- Black's king is near White's passed e-pawn\n- White needs to activate the rook while restraining Black's pawns\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h1h8 - Rook lift to the 8th rank, threatening to go behind Black's pawns\n2. e4e5 - Pushing the passed pawn\n3. g3g4 - King activity\n4. h1h6 - Rook to the 6th rank\nAnalysis:\n- e4e5 looks tempting but after ...Kf7, Black's king blocks the pawn and the rook isn't active yet\n- g3g4 allows ...Ne5+ forking king and pawn\n- h1h6 is interesting but doesn't create immediate threats\n- h1h8 is the most principled move, activating the rook to maximum effect\nAfter h1h8:\n- Black can't stop h8a8 next move, attacking the a7 pawn\n- Black's knight can't cover both the a-pawn and c-pawn\n- White gets strong counterplay against Black's queenside pawns\nThis is the most forcing and active plan. The rook belongs behind passed pawns, and here it can create multiple threats.\nFinal decision:\n```\nh1h8\n```"
