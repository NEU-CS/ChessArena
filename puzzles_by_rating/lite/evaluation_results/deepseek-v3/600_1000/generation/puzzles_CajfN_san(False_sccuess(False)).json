When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has pawns on d7, g5, a4, c4; rook on h6; knight on e4; king on g2\n- Black has pawns on b6, g6, a5, c5; rook on d8; bishop on e3; king on g7\n- White is up a passed pawn (d7) and has active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's d7 pawn is very dangerous and close to promotion\n- Black's rook is tied to defending the d8 promotion square\n- White's rook on h6 is very active and can potentially check the black king\n- Black's bishop on e3 is active but not immediately threatening\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h8: Rook sacrifice to deflect black rook from d8, allowing d7-d8 promotion\n- e4f6+: Knight check to harass black king\n- e4c5: Knight fork attacking a5 pawn and e3 bishop\n- g2h3: King move to avoid potential bishop checks\n4. Calculation of h6h8:\n- h6h8 rxh8\n- d7d8q - now white has queen vs rook and bishop, which should be winning\n- Black can't stop the promotion after the rook sacrifice\n5. Other moves:\n- e4f6+ is tempting but after Kxf6, white doesn't have immediate threats\n- e4c5 allows black to play Bxc5 and defend better\n- h6h7+ is less forcing than h6h8\nThe most forcing and decisive move is the rook sacrifice to promote the pawn. After h6h8 rxh8 d7d8q, white will have a decisive material advantage with queen vs rook and bishop.\n```\nh6h8\n```"
