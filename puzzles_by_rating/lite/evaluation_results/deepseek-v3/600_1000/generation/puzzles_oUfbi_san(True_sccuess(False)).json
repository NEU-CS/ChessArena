When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

King safety: Black king is exposed on c6, White king is still in the center\n3. Piece activity: Black's pieces are more active, especially the knights on c5 and e7\n4. Key features: White has a strong passed pawn on d5, but Black can capture it\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Kd6 - Moves king toward center but exposes it more\n2. Kb6 - Moves king to safer square but away from action\n3. Kb5 - Too risky, king would be very exposed\n4. Qxd5 - Captures pawn but allows Bxd5 winning the queen\n5. Nxd5 - Best move, captures pawn and maintains initiative\nAfter Nxd5:\n- If White recaptures with exd5, Black can play Qxd5 with strong central control\n- If White doesn't recapture immediately, Black has active knights and pressure\nNxd5 is clearly the best move as it:\n- Captures an important pawn\n- Maintains piece activity\n- Doesn't expose the king\n- Keeps initiative in Black's hands\n```\nNxd5\n```"
