When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong center with pawn on e4 and pieces well coordinated\n3. Black's bishop on b4 is active but potentially exposed\n4. White's queen on d3 and knight on c3 are eyeing the e5 pawn\n5. Black's king is still in the center, which could be dangerous\nKey observations:\n- White has threats like Nxe5 or Bxe5, so Black needs to address this\n- Black should consider castling to get the king to safety\n- The bishop on b4 could be vulnerable after moves like a3\n- The knight on g6 is well placed but could be repositioned\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e8g8 (castling) - Gets the king to safety but leaves e5 pawn vulnerable\n2. b4c3 - Trading the bishop for knight, but gives White the bishop pair\n3. d7d5 - Countering in the center, but opens up the position\n4. g6e7 - Defending e5 pawn while developing the knight\nAfter evaluating:\n- Castling (e8g8) seems most principled, getting the king safe first\n- After e8g8, if White takes e5 with Nxe5, Black can play Nxe5 and have a solid position\n- Other moves either leave the king in danger or make positional concessions\nBest move is to castle and secure the king's safety first.\n```\ne8g8\n```"
