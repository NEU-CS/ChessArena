When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (a2), Bishop (c6), pawns (d7, f7, g6, h7)\n- White has: Rook (b6), pawns (c4, f4, f6, g2, h2)\n- Black is up a bishop for a pawn, but the position is complex due to passed pawns and active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's f6 pawn is very dangerous and passed\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's rook on b6 is very active\n- Black's rook on a2 is currently passive\n- White's king is on e3, which is somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a2a8: Bringing the rook to the 8th rank to create counterplay\n- c6d5: Centralizing the bishop and attacking f3\n- g6g5: Trying to create counterplay on the kingside\n- a2g2: Sacrificing the rook for White's pawns\n4. Analysis:\n- a2a8 looks very strong, as it threatens to swing to the kingside (e8) to help stop the f-pawn while also creating mating threats against White's exposed king\n- c6d5 is tempting but after f4xd5 exd5, White's f-pawn becomes even more dangerous\n- g6g5 allows fxg5 opening lines for White's rook\n- a2g2 is too speculative as after Rxg2, White's pawns remain dangerous\n5. Best move:\na2a8 is the most principled move. It activates the rook to maximum effect, creating threats against White's king while also preparing to help stop the f-pawn if needed. The rook can swing to e8 next move to block the pawn's advance.\n```\na2a8\n```"
