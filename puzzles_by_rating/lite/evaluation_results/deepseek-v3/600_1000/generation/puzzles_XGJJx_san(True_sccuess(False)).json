If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Material is roughly equal but Black has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's queen on f2 is threatening but somewhat exposed\n- Black's bishop on g4 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White has a pawn on g3 that's currently under attack by Black's bishop\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qxg2+ winning the pawn\n- Black needs to be careful about White's potential counterplay with Re2 or other queen moves\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxg2+: Wins a pawn but after Kh1, Black's queen is in danger\n- Bf3: Defends the bishop and maintains pressure\n- Rfe8: Develops the rook and prepares to challenge White's control of the e-file\n- Qf5: Exchanges queens which might be good given White's active pieces\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qxg2+ looks tempting but after Kh1 Qxh2+ Kg1 Qxg3+ Kh1, White can play Re2 with strong counterplay\n- Bf3 is solid but doesn't maximize Black's initiative\n- Rfe8 is a good developing move but doesn't address immediate threats\n- Qf5 is strong because it forces queen trade when White's queen is very active, and after Qxf5 Bxf5, Black has good piece activity\nThe best move is to trade queens while maintaining piece activity:\n```\nQf5\n```"
