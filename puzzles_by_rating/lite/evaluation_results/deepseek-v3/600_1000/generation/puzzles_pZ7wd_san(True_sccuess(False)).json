If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

White has a strong centralized knight on d5 and active pieces\n3. Black's queen is very active on g6, eyeing g2 and c2\n4. Black's dark-squared bishop is somewhat restricted by its own pawn on d7\n5. White has potential threats like Bxf5 or Nxf5 ideas\nKey considerations:\n- Need to maintain queen activity\n- Should consider counterplay against White's center\n- Need to be careful about potential tactics (e.g. Bxf5 ideas)\nBest candidate moves:\n1. Qh5 - maintains queen activity and threatens h2\n2. Bxd5 - trades off White's strong knight but opens the position\n3. f4 - challenges White's e4 pawn but weakens e6\n4. Qf6 - keeps queen active and defends f5 pawn\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qh5 is very tempting as it threatens mate on h2 and maintains pressure\n- However, White can defend with g3, and our queen might become exposed\n- Bxd5 is solid but gives up the bishop pair\n- f4 is interesting but might be premature\n- Qf6 seems most flexible - keeps pressure, defends f5, and maintains options\nLooking deeper at Qf6:\n- Defends f5 pawn against Bxf5 ideas\n- Keeps queen active with potential to swing to h4 or d6\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n- Prepares possible ...d6 or ...Bc5 ideas\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQf6\n```"
