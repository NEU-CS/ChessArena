When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has 2 pawns vs White's 2 pawns and a knight, but White's pawns are more advanced). The position is roughly equal.\n2. King safety: Both kings are exposed but not in immediate danger. Black's king is slightly more active.\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - Black has pawns on a6, b6, c5, d6, e5, f6\n   - White has pawns on a4, b3, c4, d5, e4, g4\n   - The position is very closed with many blocked pawns.\n4. Piece activity:\n   - Black's knight on f6 is well placed but has limited mobility due to the closed position.\n   - White's knight on f2 is passive but can potentially become active.\nKey observations:\n- The position is extremely closed with many blocked pawns.\n- The kings are the most active pieces.\n- Any breakthrough would likely come from pawn moves.\nCandidate moves:\n1. g5h6 - King moves forward, but this doesn't achieve much.\n2. b6b5 - Challenges White's pawn chain, but after axb5 axb5, White gets counterplay.\n3. a6a5 - Further closes the position, but doesn't create any threats.\n4. f6g4 - Exchanges knights, but after Kxg4, White's king becomes too active.\nBest move seems to be f6g4, forcing a knight trade and reducing White's piece activity. After:\n1... Ng4\n2. Kxg4\nBlack's king can then maneuver to counter White's king activity. The resulting position should be equal.\n```\nf6g4\n```"
