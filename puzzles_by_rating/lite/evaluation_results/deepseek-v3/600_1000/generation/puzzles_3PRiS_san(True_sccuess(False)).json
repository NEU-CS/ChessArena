If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Black's bishop is very strong on c4, eyeing the kingside\n4. White's rook on f5 is active but potentially vulnerable\n5. Black has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n6. Both kings are somewhat exposed\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rxf5 - immediately winning the exchange but allowing Qxc7\n2. Rc5 - pinning the queen to the king, but White can play Qxa7\n3. Bxf1 - winning a pawn but giving up the strong bishop\n4. e2 - advancing the passed pawn\n5. Rf7 - centralizing the rook while defending the c7 rook\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rxf5 Qxc7 leaves Black with R+B vs Q, which is roughly equal but not advantageous\n- Rc5 Qxa7 gives White two connected passed pawns\n- e2 looks interesting as it pushes the passed pawn and threatens e1=Q\n- Rf7 is solid, maintaining all options while defending c7\nThe most promising move is e2, advancing the passed pawn with tempo (threatening to queen). White's best response would likely be Qxe2, but then Black can play Rxf5, winning the exchange with a strong position.\n```\ne2\n```"
