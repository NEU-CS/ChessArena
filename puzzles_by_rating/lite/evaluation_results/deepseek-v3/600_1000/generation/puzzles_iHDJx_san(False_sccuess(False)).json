When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (no immediate imbalances)\n2. King safety: Black's king is slightly exposed on the g8 square with White's bishop on h6\n3. Piece activity: White has active pieces - knight on g5, bishop on h6, queen on f4\n4. Threats: White has potential threats like Qh4-h7# or Nxe6 ideas\n5. Weaknesses: Black's e6 pawn is under pressure from White's knight and bishop\nKey observations:\n- White's pieces are very active and coordinating well\n- Black needs to address the immediate threats while improving piece coordination\n- The bishop on h6 is particularly dangerous as it pins the g7 pawn to the king\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g7h6 - Capturing the dangerous bishop, but after Nxh6+ the knight becomes very active\n2. f6g5 - Removing the knight, but Qxg5 would maintain White's initiative\n3. f8f7 - Defending g7 and preparing to double rooks on the f-file\n4. e7g6 - Blocking the bishop's diagonal and offering a queen trade\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g7h6 seems forced to remove the dangerous bishop, despite the knight recapture\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or lead to worse positions\nThe best move is to capture the bishop, even though it activates the knight, because leaving the bishop is even more dangerous.\n```\ng7h6\n```"
