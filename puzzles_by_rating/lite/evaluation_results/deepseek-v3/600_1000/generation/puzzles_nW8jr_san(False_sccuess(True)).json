When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has queen (a6), bishop (d5), pawns (a2,b2,d2,e4,g2,h2), rook (d2,h1), king (c1)\n- Black has queen (d7), rook (c8,h8), pawns (a7,b6,f6,e5,g7,h7), knight (e7), king (d8)\n2. Key observations:\n- White has a strong centralized bishop on d5\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on d8\n- White's queen on a6 is putting pressure on black's position\n- Black's knight on e7 is pinned to the king by the bishop on d5\n3. The only legal move is c8b8 (rook from c8 to b8). Let's evaluate this:\n- Gets the rook off the c-file where it's potentially exposed\n- Prepares to potentially double rooks on the b-file\n- Doesn't solve the pin on the knight\n- Doesn't address the pressure from white's pieces\n4. Alternatives:\n- Unfortunately, this is the only legal move available due to:\n  - King is in check from the bishop (but FEN says it's not)\n  - Knight is pinned and can't move\n  - Other pieces are blocked\n  - Pawns can't move without being captured\n5. Best course:\n- While not ideal, moving the rook to b8 is the only option\n- It at least gets the rook to a safer square and prepares potential counterplay on the b-file\n- The position is difficult for black, but we must play on\nGiven that c8b8 is the only legal move, we must play it:\n```\nc8b8\n```"
