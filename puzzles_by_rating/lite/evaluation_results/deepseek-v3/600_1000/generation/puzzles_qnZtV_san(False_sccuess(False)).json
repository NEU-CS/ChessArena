When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's pawns are advanced but not yet threatening promotion.\n3. White's pawn structure is weak with isolated pawns.\n4. Black's queen is very active and controls key squares.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qe7 - attacking the f6 pawn and threatening Qxg7#\n   - But after ...Qxe7, White doesn't have enough compensation\n2. Qh6+ - forcing the king to move\n   - After ...Kxh6, White has no follow-up\n3. Rc7 - pinning the f7 pawn to the king\n   - Black can play ...Qd1+ forcing the king to move, then ...Qxa4\n4. Qd4 - attacking the b4 pawn\n   - Black can play ...Qxd4 and White loses material\n5. Rc6 - attacking the queen\n   - Black can simply move the queen away while maintaining threats\nAfter careful consideration, the best move seems to be Rc7, creating multiple threats:\n- It pins the f7 pawn to the king\n- Threatens to win the f7 pawn with Qe7 next move\n- If Black tries to counter with ...Qd1+, White can play Kb2 maintaining the pin\nThis keeps some initiative and prevents Black from immediately exploiting their material advantage.\n```\nc1c7\n```"
