When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a very strong attacking position with the queen on h5 and bishop on g5 targeting Black's king\n3. Black's king is exposed on e7 with limited defenders\n4. Black's dark squares around the king are weak (f7, g6, h7)\nThe most forcing and decisive move appears to be h5e8 (queen sacrifice on e8). Let's calculate:\nh5e8:\n- Black must take with the king (kxe8)\n- Then g5d8 is check, winning the queen on b6 (since the bishop is protected by the rook on a1)\n- After ...Qxd8, Rxd8+ and White is up a rook\nAlternative moves:\n- h5f7+ looks tempting but after ...Kd7, White doesn't have an immediate knockout\n- h5h7 threatens mate but Black can defend with ...Qf7\n- g5f6 is interesting but not as forcing\nThe queen sacrifice leads to a decisive material advantage, so it's the best move.\n```\nh5e8\n```"
