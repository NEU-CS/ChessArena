When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king (e8), queen (f7), rook (f2), knight (g5), pawns (a6, d6, e5, e3, h7)\n- White has: queen (h8), bishop (g4), knight (c4), pawns (a2, c3, g3, h2), rook (d1), rook (f1), king (g1)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed and under threat from White's queen on h8\n- White has a strong battery with rook on f1 pointing at Black's queen\n- Black's rook on f2 is pinned to the king by White's rook on f1\n- Black's knight on g5 is under attack by White's bishop on g4\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Qh8xg8+ next move if we don't address it\n- The pin on the f2 rook is very dangerous\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: blocks the check and defends the king, but allows Qxg8+ anyway\n- e8d8: moves the king away from danger\n- f2f1+: counterattack with rook sacrifice\n- g5e6: knight move that also defends g8\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e8d8 looks safest, moving the king away from danger while keeping material\n- f2f1+ is interesting but after Rxf1 Qxf1, we're still in trouble\n- g5e6 doesn't solve the immediate threat to the king\nThe best move is to get the king to safety first:\n```\ne8d8\n```"
