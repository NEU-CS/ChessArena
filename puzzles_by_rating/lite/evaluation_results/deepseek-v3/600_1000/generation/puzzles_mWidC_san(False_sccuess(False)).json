When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: King, Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns\n- Black has: King, Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is equal, but White has better piece coordination.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop is very active on d7, controlling important squares\n- Black's rook is tied to defending the a6 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Both sides have passed pawns (White's h-pawn, Black's a-pawn)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7e8: Bishop checks the king, forcing it to move\n- d7c6: Bishop captures black's bishop, but after ...bxc6, black gets connected passed pawns\n- d1d6: Rook moves to attack the f6 pawn\n- g2g4: Pushing the pawn to challenge black's f4 pawn\n4. Best move analysis:\n- d7e8 looks very strong as it forces the black king to move (likely to h7)\n- After Kh7, we can consider d1d6 attacking f6, or g2g4 to undermine black's pawn structure\n- The immediate bishop check disrupts black's coordination and maintains our initiative\nThe move d7e8 is the most forcing and keeps the initiative. Other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow black to consolidate.\n```\nd7e8\n```"
