When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has bishop pair vs White's bishop+knight, but White has a strong centralized knight on d5)\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on d5, well-supported and controlling key squares\n- Black's queen on g6 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White has pressure on the b-file against Black's b7 bishop\n- Black's king is still in the center (castled queenside but not fully safe)\n- White has a space advantage with e4 pawn\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxb7 winning a pawn\n- White could increase pressure with moves like Rfb1\n- Black needs to address the b7 bishop's safety\n4. Candidate moves:\na) b7a6 - moves bishop to safety but blocks a-pawn\nb) b7c6 - challenges the strong knight but after Nxc6 dxc6, White has Qxb7\nc) f8d6 - develops bishop to active square, defends b7 indirectly\nd) g6e8 - queen retreat to defend b7 but passive\ne) d8e8 - connects rooks but doesn't solve b7 issue\nAfter careful consideration, f8d6 seems best because:\n- It develops the bishop actively\n- Indirectly defends b7 (if Qxb7 then Bxc3)\n- Controls important central squares\n- Prepares possible ...Bc5 to challenge White's strong bishop\n- Keeps options open for both queenside and kingside play\nOther moves either leave the b7 bishop vulnerable or are too passive.\nHere's the move:\n```\nf8d6\n```"
