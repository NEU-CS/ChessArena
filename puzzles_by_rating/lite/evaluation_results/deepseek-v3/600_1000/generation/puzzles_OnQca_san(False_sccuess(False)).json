When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a centralized knight on h5 eyeing f4 and g3 squares\n3. White has a knight on c3 that could be developed more actively\n4. White's queen is somewhat exposed on d2\n5. Black's queen on e7 is well placed, eyeing the h4 square\n6. White's king is still in the corner while Black's is more centralized\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c3d5 - Centralizing the knight, attacking e7 queen and c6 knight\n2. h2g4 - Developing the knight, attacking h6 pawn and h5 knight\n3. d2f2 - Moving queen to a safer square, connecting rooks\n4. a1d1 - Connecting rooks, preparing to double on d-file\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- c3d5 looks most promising as it immediately challenges Black's position. After c3d5:\n  - If Black takes with c6xd5, we recapture exd5, opening the e-file and gaining space\n  - If Black moves queen away, we maintain a strong centralized knight\n  - It also prevents Black from playing ...Nf4 in some lines\nh2g4 is also interesting but allows ...Nxg4 hxg4 Qxh3+ with complications.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc3d5\n```"
