When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is very active on f7\n- White's rook controls the 4th rank\n- Black's king is on h7, somewhat exposed\n- Black's passed pawn on b7 is potentially dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on g2\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to push g2-g4-g5, creating a passed pawn\n- White could also try to activate the rook further\n- Black needs to find counterplay\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h7h8: King moves away from potential checks but becomes very passive\n- h7h6: Keeps king more active but still somewhat exposed\n- Rook moves: Need to find active squares while protecting the b-pawn\n5. Best options:\n- a5h5 looks interesting - rook moves to h-file, potentially creating threats against White's king while still protecting the b-pawn\n- b7b5 advances the passed pawn but may be premature as White can attack it with the rook\n- Other rook moves either don't create threats or abandon the b-pawn\nAfter careful consideration, a5h5 seems best as it:\n- Keeps the rook active\n- Creates potential threats against White's king\n- Maintains protection of the b-pawn\n- Prepares potential checks or mate threats along the h-file\nThe move also prevents White from easily advancing the g-pawn as the rook now eyes the h2 square.\n```\na5h5\n```"
