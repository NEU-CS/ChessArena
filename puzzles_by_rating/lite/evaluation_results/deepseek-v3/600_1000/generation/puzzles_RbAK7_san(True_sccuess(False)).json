If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Material is roughly equal but Black has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on h4 is under attack by Black's bishop on e4\n- Black's rook on e8 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on d2\n- Black has passed pawns on b2 and c4\n3. Threats:\n- Black can play Bxh4 immediately, but after Rxh4 the position remains balanced\n- More promising is to attack White's exposed king while maintaining pressure\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Bc3+ forces the king to move and opens lines\n- Re5 centralizes the rook and threatens to swing to the kingside\n- b1=Q promotes the pawn with check\nAfter careful consideration, Bc3+ is the most forcing move that creates immediate threats while maintaining all of Black's advantages. It forces the king to move and opens lines for further attack.\nThe move is:\n```\nBc3+\n```"
