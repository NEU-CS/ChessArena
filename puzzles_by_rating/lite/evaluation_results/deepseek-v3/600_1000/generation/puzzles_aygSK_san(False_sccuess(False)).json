When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a bishop pair and slightly better piece coordination. Black has doubled rooks on the c-file and a queen on g3 threatening h2.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on g3 is very active, eyeing h2\n- Black has a bishop on e6 that's somewhat restricted by White's pawn on e5\n- White's bishop on b5 is very active and could potentially target the weak f7 square\n- White's rooks are not optimally placed yet\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5e8: Trading bishops and removing a defender of f7\n- f3g5: Attacking the queen while developing the knight\n- e3f5: Centralizing the knight and threatening to jump to g7\n- d2a5: Developing the bishop with tempo on the a5-e1 diagonal\n4. Threats to address:\n- Need to defend against potential Qxh2+ threats\n- Should improve piece coordination\n- Could consider activating the rooks\nAfter careful consideration, b5e8 seems strongest:\n- It trades off Black's good bishop\n- Opens the f-file for White's rook\n- Removes a defender of f7, making future attacks easier\n- The bishop isn't doing much else on b5 after this move\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- f3g5 allows Qxg5 with complications\n- e3f5 doesn't address the immediate threats\n- d2a5 leaves the h2 pawn vulnerable\nHere's the move:\n```\nb5e8\n```"
