When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King positions: White king is on d2, Black king is on d4.\n3. Passed pawns: White's b6 pawn is very advanced and dangerous.\n4. Black's rook is on b7, controlling the b-file and preventing immediate promotion of the b-pawn.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h6h8 - Rook lift to 8th rank, but not immediately useful\n2. h6h7 - Controls 7th rank, but doesn't create immediate threats\n3. h6g6 - Attacks g4 pawn, but Black can defend with Rg7\n4. h6f6 - Controls f-file, but not clear purpose\n5. h6e6 - Pins e5 pawn to king, interesting\n6. h6d6 - Pins d3 pawn to king, very strong\n7. b6b7 - Not legal (not in move list)\n8. f2f3/f4 - Pawn moves don't seem critical\nThe most promising moves seem to be h6d6 and h6e6:\n- h6d6 pins the d3 pawn to the black king. If Black moves the rook, we can take the pawn with check (Rxd3+). If Black moves the king, we can capture the pawn next move.\n- h6e6 pins the e5 pawn, but this is less valuable as the e5 pawn isn't as critical.\nAfter h6d6:\n- If Black plays Kc5, then Rxd3 wins a pawn with check\n- If Black plays Ke5, then Rxd3 is still possible\n- If Black moves the rook, we get Rxd3+ with discovered attack\nThis seems like the most forcing move that creates immediate threats. The other moves don't create such direct pressure.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh6d6\n```"
