When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a pawn on d4, but White has a bishop on f3 attacking it).\n2. Key features:\n   - Black's queen is very active on e5\n   - White's queen is on e2, defending the f3 bishop\n   - Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n   - White has castling rights\n   - Black's d4 pawn is under attack by the f3 bishop\n3. Threats:\n   - White could castle next move, completing development\n   - The d4 pawn is hanging and needs protection\n   - Black needs to develop pieces and get the king to safety\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - e5f6: Trading queens, but after Bxf6, Black's pawn structure is damaged\n   - e5d5: Centralizing the queen more, but doesn't address development\n   - g8f6: Developing the knight while protecting d5\n   - e8d8: Getting the king off the open file\n   - d4d3: Advancing the pawn, but this seems premature\n5. Best move considerations:\n   - g8f6 develops a piece, protects d5, and prepares to castle\n   - It also maintains pressure on the center\n   - Other moves either don't develop pieces or create weaknesses\nAfter careful consideration, developing the knight to f6 is the most principled move, completing development and preparing to castle while maintaining central control.\n```\ng8f6\n```"
