When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: rook, bishop, bishop, pawns (a7, b2, c4, d5, f5, h7)\n- White has: knight, bishop, rook, pawn (none visible, likely none)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on g3 is very active, eyeing the g7 square\n- White's knight on h4 is well placed, controlling f5\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's bishop on e4 is strong but could be vulnerable\n- Black's pawn on b2 is about to promote\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Rg7 or Nh4-f5\n- Black needs to address king safety and the promotion opportunity\n4. Candidate moves:\na) b2b1q - promoting immediately, but White can play Rg7 with strong threats\nb) e8g8 - moving the rook to protect the king, but allows Rg7 anyway\nc) f6g7 - blocking the rook's path to g7, but allows Nh4xg6 ideas\nd) e4f3 - moving the bishop to defend g2 square, but may not be most critical\nAfter careful consideration, promoting the pawn immediately seems best, as it creates counterplay and threats against White's king. Even if White plays Rg7, we can respond with Qd3+ creating our own threats.\nThe best move is:\n```\nb2b1q\n```"
