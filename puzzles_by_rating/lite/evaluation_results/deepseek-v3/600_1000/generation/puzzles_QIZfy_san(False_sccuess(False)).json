When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully.\nKey observations:\n1. Black is in a very difficult position. White has a strong attack with the queen on h5 and rook on g3, threatening mate on g7.\n2. Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited escape squares.\n3. Black has a bishop on b7 and queen on c7 that are somewhat active but not coordinating well for defense.\n4. White's pawn structure is solid and they have threats against the black king.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g7f8 - blocking the rook's path to g7, but allows Qxh7#\n2. g7h6 - blocks the queen's attack on h7, but allows Rg7 threatening mate\n3. c7f7 - tries to defend g7, but allows Qxh7+ Kxh7 Rg7#\n4. d2d1+ - checks the white king, but after Kxd1, the attack continues\n5. h7h6 - creates an escape square for the king, but allows Qxh6 with mate threats\nAfter careful consideration, the best try is h7h6, creating an escape route for the king. While it loses the h-pawn, it prevents immediate mate and gives the king some breathing room. Other moves lead to quicker losses.\nThe move:\n```\nh7h6\n```"
