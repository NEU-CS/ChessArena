If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black has more pawns.\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2, while Black's king is relatively safe on c7.\n3. Pawn structure: White has an isolated e-pawn, Black has connected passed pawns on the queenside (a6, b5, c5).\n4. Immediate threats: Black's knight on h3 is threatening White's king and could potentially deliver mate with ...Rh8 or ...Rg8 ideas.\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) Defensive moves:\n- N3h2 (removes the knight threat but blocks the rook)\n- Kh2 (gets out of knight's attack but still leaves king exposed)\n- Ng3 (blocks the g-file but leaves f3 knight undefended)\nB) Active moves:\n- Rd7+ (checks the king and forces it to move)\n- exf6 (opens the e-file for the rook)\n- c4 (tries to undermine Black's pawn structure)\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rd7+ seems most promising as it forces Black's king to move, likely to b6 or c8, disrupting coordination.\n- After Kb6, White can follow up with ideas like c4 to attack the pawn structure.\n- If Kc8, then Re7 puts pressure on the e-file.\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or don't improve White's position.\n```\nRd7+\n```"
