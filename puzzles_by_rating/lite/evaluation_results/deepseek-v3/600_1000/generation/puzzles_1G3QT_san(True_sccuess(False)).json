When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (d6), Queen (f3), Rook (f1), Bishop (c2), 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook (f8), Rook (e7), Queen (g5), 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White has strong pressure on the f-file with doubled rooks\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen is defending against Black's threats\n- Black has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Rxf8+ winning the exchange\n- Black's immediate threats are limited, but Qxg3+ is possible\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Qxg3+ - forces White to take with hxg3, but then Black has Rxf3 winning back material\nb) Rxf3 - immediately trades down, but White recaptures with Qxf3\nc) Rf6 - defends against Rxf8+ while maintaining pressure\nd) g6 - creates luft for the king but weakens dark squares\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qxg3+ seems most forcing: 1...Qxg3+ 2.hxg3 Rxf3 3.Rxf3 exf3 4.gxf3 and Black has Rook vs Bishop+pawn, which should be drawn\n- Other moves either lose material or don't improve Black's position\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxg3+\n```"
