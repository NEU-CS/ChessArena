When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Threats:\n- Black is threatening Qxh2#\n- White has several forcing moves to consider\n4. Candidate moves to analyze:\na) Qxg6+ - forces the king to move, but after Kf8 the attack may fizzle out\nb) Qxh5 - removes the dangerous pawn but gives up the initiative\nc) Rxb7 - wins a bishop but allows Black counterplay\nd) Ra8 - threatens mate but can be defended\ne) Qh6 - keeps pressure and defends h2\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qxg6+ Kf8 and Black can defend\n- Qxh5 Qxh2# is mate for Black\n- Rxb7 Qxh2# is also mate\n- Ra8 Rxa8 and we lose material\n- Qh6 is the best as it:\n  * Defends against Qxh2#\n  * Maintains all our threats\n  * Keeps pressure on g6\n  * Allows potential discovered attacks with the knight\n```\nQh6\n```"
