When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, queen, rook and pawns vs Black's bishop, rook, queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on g5 is very active\n- Black's queen on g6 is exposed\n- Black's king is somewhat vulnerable on g8\n- White has pressure along the b-file with rook on b1 and bishop on b3\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h7: Forking king and rook, but after Kxh7, Qxg6 is met with Qxg6 and we lose material\n- g5f7: Forking king and rook, but after Kxf7, Qxg6+ Kxg6 and we're down material\n- b3f7: Sacrificing the bishop to expose the king, but not immediately winning\n- d2a5: Attacking the a6 pawn while developing the queen\n- d2f4: Centralizing the queen with threats\n4. Best move seems to be g5e6!:\n- Creates a discovered attack on the queen by the bishop on b3\n- If Black takes the knight with fxe6, then Bxg8 wins the exchange\n- If Black moves the queen, we can consider capturing on f7 next move\n- Maintains pressure while keeping material balance\nHowever, looking at the legal moves provided, g5e6 is not listed (strange, as it should be legal). The next best option appears to be b3f7, sacrificing the bishop to open up Black's king position.\nAfter b3f7 Kxf7, we can follow up with Qd5+ forcing the king to move and creating threats against the exposed position.\nHere's the move:\n```\nb3f7\n```"
