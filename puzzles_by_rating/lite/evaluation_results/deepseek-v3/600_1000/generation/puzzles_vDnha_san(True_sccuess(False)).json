When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: 1 pawn on a6, 1 pawn on b3, 1 pawn on f4, 1 pawn on f5, 1 knight on b7\n- Black has: 1 king on f7, 1 rook on e3, 1 pawn on c6, 1 pawn on h4\n2. Positional factors:\n- White's king is exposed on a2\n- Black's rook is actively placed on e3\n- White has connected passed pawns on the f-file\n- Black's h-pawn is advanced but blockaded\n3. Key observations:\n- White's knight is very active on b7, threatening to jump to d6\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- The immediate threat is Rxb3, winning a pawn\n- After Rxb3, White can play Kxb3, but then Black's king can approach\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Rxb3: Immediate pawn win, but allows White counterplay\n- Re8: Defends against potential knight checks\n- Kg7: Improves king safety\n- c5: Creates a passed pawn\nAfter careful consideration, Rxb3 seems the most forcing and best move:\n- After 1...Rxb3 2.Kxb3 Ke7, Black's king can approach the center\n- White's pawns are not fast enough to promote\n- Black can create counterplay with the c-pawn\n- The material advantage should be decisive\nOther moves like Re8 or Kg7 are too passive and allow White to consolidate.\n```\nRxb3\n```"
