If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

White has a strong knight on f4 and pressure on the kingside\n3. Black's king is exposed on g7 with white's bishop on f7\n4. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n5. White has a passed g-pawn that could become dangerous\nThe most critical threats to address:\n- White could play Qh7+ next move if we don't prevent it\n- The f7 bishop is very strong and needs to be dealt with\n- The g5 pawn could advance and become dangerous\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rg8 - defends against Qh7+ but blocks the king's escape\n2. Qxg5 - takes the pawn but leaves king exposed\n3. Nxg7 - sacrifices knight to remove dangerous bishop\n4. Nh6 - blocks the bishop's diagonal\n5. Kxg7 - takes bishop but leaves king very exposed\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rg8 is too passive and blocks the king\n- Qxg5 allows Qh7+ with mate threats\n- Nxg7 Kxg7 leaves black's king too exposed\n- Nh6 seems best as it blocks the bishop's diagonal and maintains coordination\nThe move Nh6:\n- Blocks the f7 bishop's diagonal\n- Prevents Qh7+\n- Maintains piece coordination\n- Keeps options open for counterplay\nOther options either leave the king too exposed or are too passive. Nh6 is the most principled move that addresses the immediate threats while maintaining piece activity.\n```\nNh6\n```"
