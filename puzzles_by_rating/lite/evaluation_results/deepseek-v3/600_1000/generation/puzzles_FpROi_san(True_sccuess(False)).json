If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Material is roughly equal (rook + minor piece each).\n2. Key features:\n- Black's bishop is very active on b6, controlling the a7-g1 diagonal.\n- White's rook is on g6, potentially threatening the g-file.\n- Black's rook is on f2, attacking White's knight on c2.\n- Both sides have passed pawns (White's b5, Black's a5 and d5/e5).\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black has several checks available (Rf3+, Rd2+, e4+, d4)\n- White's knight is under attack by the rook\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on d3\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxc2: Wins the knight but allows White counterplay with Rg7+ attacking our king\n- Rf3+: Forces White's king to move, but where? Ke4 is dangerous due to our bishop\n- Rd2+: Another check, but White can block with Nxd2\n- e4+/d4: Pawn checks that open lines\nAfter careful consideration, Rf3+ seems strongest:\n- If Ke4, we have Bc5+ winning the rook\n- If Kc3, we can play Rf1 with threats\n- If Kd4, we have Rd2+ winning material\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White counterplay. The pawn checks (e4+/d4) are interesting but don't lead to immediate gains.\n```\nRf3+\n```"
