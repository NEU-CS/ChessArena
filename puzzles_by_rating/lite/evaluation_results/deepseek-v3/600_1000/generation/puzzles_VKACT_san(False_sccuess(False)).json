When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- White has: Bishop, Queen, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on d6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen on e2 is eyeing the g2 pawn and can potentially create threats\n- Black has a passed pawn on g2 that's one square from promotion\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg2 next move if we don't defend it\n- White's bishop could potentially create mating threats with Qh5 ideas\n4. Candidate moves:\na) g3g8 - Blocking the rook's path to the back rank, but allows Qxg2\nb) f8f3 - Pinning the g3 pawn to the king, but White can play Qxg2 anyway\nc) h4d8 - Trading bishops, but after Bxd8 Rxd8, White still has Qxg2\nd) g3g4 - Moving the pawn to defend g2, but allows Qh5 with threats\ne) f8g8 - Protecting the king and preparing to double rooks\nThe best move appears to be f8g8, which:\n- Protects the king from potential back rank threats\n- Prepares to double rooks on the g-file\n- Maintains control over the position\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactical blows from White\nOther moves either allow Qxg2 or create weaknesses. While we have the passed g2 pawn, we need to ensure our king is safe first before pushing it.\n```\nf8g8\n```"
