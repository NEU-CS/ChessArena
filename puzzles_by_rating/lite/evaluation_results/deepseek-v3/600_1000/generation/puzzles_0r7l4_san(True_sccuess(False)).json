If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has Q+R+R+B+N vs White's Q+R+R+B). \n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on f7 with White's bishop on b2 eyeing the g7 square. White's king is safer on h1.\n3. Piece activity: Black's rooks are doubled on the c-file but not very active. The bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on f5. The knight on f6 is decently placed.\n4. Threats: White has potential threats like Bxe6 or Re1-e5 ideas. Black needs to improve piece coordination.\nKey observations:\n- The immediate Rxh2+ is tempting but after Kxh2, Black doesn't have a clear follow-up.\n- The knight on f6 is doing important defensive work guarding h5 and e4 squares.\n- The bishop on e6 is a bit passive and could be improved.\nBest candidate moves:\n1. Bd5 - Centralizes the bishop and threatens to exchange White's strong bishop on b2. After Bxd5 Qxd5, Black gets more active pieces.\n2. Qd6 - Connects rooks and prepares to double on the c-file or swing the queen to h6.\n3. Rhg8 - Prepares to bring the rook to g7 for king defense.\nAfter careful consideration, Bd5 seems most promising as it:\n- Activates the bishop\n- Challenges White's strong bishop\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n```\nBd5\n```"
