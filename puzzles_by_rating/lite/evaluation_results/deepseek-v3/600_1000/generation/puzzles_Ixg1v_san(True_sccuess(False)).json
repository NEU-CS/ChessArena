If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Material count:\n- White has Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has Rook, 2 pawns\nWhite is up a Bishop and pawn, but Black has some counterplay with passed pawns.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's pawn on e2 is about to promote\n- White's Rook on d8 is very active\n- Black's King is exposed but White's King is also somewhat vulnerable\n- Black has connected passed pawns on a3 and b4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e1=Q (promoting immediately)\n- Rxc4 (capturing the Bishop)\n- Kh7 (moving the King to safety)\n- Rc2 (attacking the e2 pawn)\n4. Analysis:\n- e1=Q looks tempting but after Rxe1 Rxe1, White has Rd1 pinning the Queen\n- Rxc4 Bxc4 e1=Q leads to a Queen vs Rook+Bishop endgame which might be drawish\n- Kh7 seems passive and allows White to consolidate\n- Rc2 defends the e2 pawn while keeping options open\n5. Best move:\nRc2 is the most flexible - it defends the e2 pawn while keeping all options open. White can't immediately capture the pawn (Bxe2?? Rxe2 and Black wins). It also keeps the Rook active for potential checks or counterplay.\n```\nRc2\n```"
