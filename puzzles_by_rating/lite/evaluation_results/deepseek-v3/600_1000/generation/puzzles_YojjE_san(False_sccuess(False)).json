When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on f7, attacking the e8 rook\n- Black's queen is centralized on e4\n- White has a bishop on c3 pinning the e5 knight to the e4 queen\n- Black's king is exposed on c7\n- White has rooks on e1 and c1 with potential for doubling\n3. Threats:\n- Black has Qxh2# threat if White doesn't address it\n- White has potential discovered attacks with the bishop\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qg7+ (f7g7) - forces the king to move and may lead to mate\n- Qxe8 (f7e8) - wins the rook but allows Qxh2#\n- Bxe5 (c3e5) - removes the knight and pins the queen\n- Defending against Qxh2# with Kh1 (g1h1) or Kf2 (g1f2)\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qg7+ (f7g7) looks very strong as it forces the king to move and creates mating threats\n- After Kb6 or Kd8, White can follow up with Rd1+ or other checks\n- Other moves either allow mate or don't maximize White's advantage\nThe most forcing and strongest move is Qg7+, which maintains the initiative and creates immediate threats against Black's king.\n```\nf7g7\n```"
