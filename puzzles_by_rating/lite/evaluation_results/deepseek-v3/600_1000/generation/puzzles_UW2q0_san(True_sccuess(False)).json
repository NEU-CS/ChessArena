If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material: White has 2 rooks vs Black's queen. Material is roughly equal (10 vs 9 points), but queen vs two rooks is often better for the rooks when they can coordinate.\n2. Pawn structure:\n- White has pawns on b2, d4, f4, g4, h3\n- Black has pawns on b4, d5, d6, h6\n- White's pawns are more advanced but somewhat loose\n- Black's king is more exposed\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's queen is very active on c7\n- White's rooks are well placed on e3 and f3\n- Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed\n- White's king is on g1, safe but not active\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rg3: Brings rook to g-file to pressure g7\n- Re7: Pinning the d6 pawn\n- g5: Opens lines against black's king\n- h4: Prepares g5 push\n- f5: Opens f-file for rooks\n5. Best options:\n- g5 looks very promising as it opens lines against black's king. After hxg5, fxg5 opens the f-file and weakens black's king position.\n- Re7 is also interesting as it pins the d6 pawn and threatens to win it, but black can defend with Qc6.\nAfter careful consideration, g5 seems most forcing and creates immediate threats against black's king while opening lines for the rooks.\n```\ng5\n```"
