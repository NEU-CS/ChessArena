My king is exposed, and White has threats like Qxg7# or Re8+.\nKey observations:\n1. White's immediate threats:\n   - Qxg7# is not possible yet (pawn on f7 covers g7)\n   - Re8+ would be deadly if allowed\n   - Qd8+ is another dangerous idea\n2. My pieces:\n   - Queen on c5 is active but needs to watch for discovered attacks\n   - Rook on a8 is inactive\n   - Pawn structure is loose with weaknesses\n3. Critical issues:\n   - Need to protect against Re8+\n   - Need to prevent Qd8+\n   - Need to safeguard my king\nLooking at the candidate moves:\n1. Kh8/Kf8 - Both run into Re8+ followed by Qd8+ with mate threats\n2. Rf8 - Seems most logical to block the e-file and prevent Re8+\n3. Q moves - Most queen moves either lose material or don't address the threats\n4. Pawn moves - Don't solve the immediate problems\nAfter considering all options, Rf8 seems most resilient:\n- It blocks the e-file\n- Protects against Qd8+\n- Maintains some coordination\nOther moves like Qxe5 lose immediately to Rxe5, and king moves allow deadly checks.\n```\nRf8\n```"
