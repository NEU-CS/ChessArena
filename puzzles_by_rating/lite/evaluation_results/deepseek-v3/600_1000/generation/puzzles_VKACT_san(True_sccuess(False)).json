If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (f8), Rook (g3), Bishop (h4), pawns (b6, a5, e5, g2, h6)\n- White has: Bishop (d6), Queen (e2), pawns (a2, b2, d5, e4)\n2. Key features:\n- Black has two active rooks and a bishop attacking the white king\n- White's king is very exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on g2 that's one square from promotion\n- White's bishop on d6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Rgxf3, winning the g2 pawn\n- White's queen is defending g2, but we can deflect it\n- The h4 bishop is very strong, pinning the e2 queen to the king\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Rgxf3: Wins the pawn but allows Qxf3, though we have Bxe2 coming\n- Rh3: Prepares to double on the h-file with Rfh8\n- Rfxf3: Similar to Rgxf3 but less forcing\n- Be7: Defends against potential Bxb6 threats\n5. Best move:\nRgxf3 is the most forcing and strongest move:\n- After 1...Rgxf3 2.Qxf3 Bxe2 3.Rxe2 Rf1+ 4.Kg2 Rf2+ wins the rook\n- White can try 2.Kh1 instead of Qxf3, but then 2...Rf1+ 3.Kh2 R8f2 is crushing\n- The g2 pawn will promote soon with decisive advantage\nThe move wins material by force and maintains all of Black's attacking potential.\n```\nRgxf3\n```"
