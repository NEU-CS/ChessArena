When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (a1), Rook (e1), Queen (c4), 2 Knights (b5, b8), 2 pawns (a3, b2), pawn (g3), pawn (h2)\n- Black has: Rook (a8), Bishop (h7), Knight (f3), Queen (h3), 2 pawns (f7, e7), pawn (d6), pawn (g6), pawn (g7)\n- White is up a knight but down a pawn, roughly equal material\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on g1 with black queen on h3\n- Black has threats like Qxh2# or Qg2# if not careful\n- Black knight on f3 is very dangerous near white king\n3. Available moves:\n- g1f2: moves king away from immediate threats\n- g1h1: moves king towards corner\nAnalysis of g1f2:\n- Gets king away from h3 queen's diagonal\n- But moves into potential discovered attack from f3 knight if black plays ...Bh7-e4\n- Also after ...Qxh2, Kf2 Qh1 is very dangerous\nAnalysis of g1h1:\n- Moves king to corner where it's harder to attack\n- Still must watch for Qxh2 followed by Qg2#\n- But gives more defensive resources with Rh1 if needed\nAfter careful consideration, g1h1 is the safer choice as it:\n1. Removes the king from the dangerous f2 square\n2. Provides potential for Rh1 defense\n3. Makes it harder for black to create immediate mating threats\nThe position is very dangerous for white, but g1h1 offers the best chances to survive.\n```\ng1h1\n```"
