If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White's bishop is very active on e6, eyeing the g8 square and controlling important diagonals\n- Black's rooks are doubled on the c-file but not yet penetrating\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White has a passed a-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bf7+: Forcing the black king to move, but after Kxf7 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- Rxf5: Winning a pawn but allowing Black counterplay with Rc1+\n- Nd5: Centralizing the knight and threatening Nf4+\n- Bg8: Trapping the rook, but Black can play Rc1+ with counterplay\n4. Best move seems to be Nd5 because:\n- It centralizes the knight powerfully\n- Threatens Nf4+ winning the exchange or mating\n- If Black plays Rc1+, White has Kf2 maintaining control\n- After Nd5, Black has no good way to defend against Nf4+ ideas\n- It keeps all of White's positional advantages\nOther moves either give up the initiative or allow Black counterplay. Nd5 maintains maximum pressure.\n```\nNd5\n```"
