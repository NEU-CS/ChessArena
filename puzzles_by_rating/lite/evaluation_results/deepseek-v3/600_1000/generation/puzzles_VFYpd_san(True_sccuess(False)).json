If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Key features:\n- White's queen on d5 is very strong, controlling many squares.\n- Black's king is exposed on a7.\n- White has a passed g-pawn that could become dangerous.\n- Black has connected passed pawns on a5 and b7, but they're not advanced yet.\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxb7+ winning the pawn.\n- White could also play Qd7+ next move, further harassing the black king.\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Kb8 - gets the king away from checks but doesn't address other threats\nb) Qxg3+ - trades queens but leaves Black in a bad bishop ending\nc) Qh1+ - forces the white king to move, but then what?\nd) Bc5 - blocks the queen's path to b7 while developing the bishop\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qxg3+ leads to a lost bishop ending after hxg3.\n- Kb8 allows Qxb7+ which is bad.\n- Bc5 seems best as it prevents Qxb7+ and develops the bishop to a more active square.\nThe move Bc5 also creates potential threats against the white king position while defending the b7 pawn.\n```\nBc5\n```"
