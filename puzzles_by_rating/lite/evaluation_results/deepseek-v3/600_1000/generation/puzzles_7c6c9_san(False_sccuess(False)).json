When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Piece activity:\n   - White has active pieces with the knight on g5 and queen on d3 eyeing h7\n   - Black's pieces are somewhat passive, especially the rooks\n3. King safety:\n   - Both kings are castled but White's king looks slightly safer\n4. Weaknesses:\n   - Black's h6 pawn could be a target\n   - White's pawn on a3 could be weak in the long run\nKey observations:\n- White's knight on g5 is very active and threatens Nxe6 or Nxh7 ideas\n- Black needs to deal with the immediate threat to h7 while improving piece coordination\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h6g5 - Capturing the knight immediately, but after Qxg5 White maintains pressure\n2. f7f6 - Pushing the knight away, but weakens e6\n3. e7f6 - Developing the bishop while defending h7\n4. d5f4 - Centralizing the knight with tempo on the queen\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e7f6 seems most solid, developing the bishop while defending h7\n- It maintains control over key squares and doesn't create new weaknesses\n- The bishop on f6 can later go to g7 or h4 depending on circumstances\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- h6g5 gives up the h-file and leaves Black's king more exposed\n- f7f6 weakens e6 and the dark squares\n- d5f4 allows White to play Qf3 with pressure\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne7f6\n```"
