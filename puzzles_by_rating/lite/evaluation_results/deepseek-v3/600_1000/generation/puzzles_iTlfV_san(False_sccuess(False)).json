When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on c4 controlling the a2-g8 diagonal\n- Rook on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawn weaknesses around it\n- Black's knight on h7 is awkwardly placed\n- White has a space advantage with pawns on e4 and g4\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) h5h7 - Rook sacrifice to remove the defensive knight. After Nxh7, Qxh7+ Kf8, White has strong threats but Black can defend.\nb) c4f7 - Bishop sacrifice to expose the king. After Qxf7+ Rxf7, Rxf7 Kxf7, but Black's king escapes.\nc) g3e5 - Centralizing the queen with tempo, attacking e5 pawn and eyeing h8.\nd) c4e6 - Strong positional move, pinning the queen to the king.\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h5h7 is tempting but may not lead to a decisive advantage after accurate defense.\n- c4f7 is too speculative as Black can defend.\n- g3e5 is strong but allows Black counterplay with ...Qd6.\n- c4e6 is the most forcing move, maintaining all threats while pinning the queen.\nThe best move is c4e6, creating multiple threats (discovered attack on the queen, potential mate threats) while keeping all options open. Black will have serious problems defending.\n```\nc4e6\n```"
