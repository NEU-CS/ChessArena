If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook on b7, Queen on d3, pawns on d5, g3, c2, g2, h2\n- Black has: King on g8, Knight on f6, Rook on e1, Queen on c1, pawns on a7, f7, g7, h6, c6\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen is attacking White's knight on e1 (pinned to the king)\n- White's queen on d3 is very active and controls many squares\n- White's rook on b7 is threatening the a7 pawn\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxd1 winning the exchange (rook for knight)\n- White could play Rb8+ with a strong attack\n- White's queen has potential mating threats if allowed to get to h7\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxd1: Simplifies but gives up the queen for rook+knight\n- Rf1+: Checks the king and forces it to move\n- Qf4+/Qg5: Checks that could lead to complications\n- Re8: Defends against Rb8+ ideas\n- Ne4+: Developing the knight with tempo\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rf1+ seems tempting as it forces the king to move (likely to e2 or e3)\n- However, after Rf1+ Ke3, Black doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- Qf4+ is interesting but after Kf1, Black's queen is exposed\n- Re8 is solid, preventing Rb8+ ideas\n- Ne4+ is the most dynamic option, developing with tempo and opening lines\nThe best move appears to be Ne4+, which:\n- Develops the knight with tempo\n- Forces the king to move (likely Ke2 or Kf1)\n- Opens potential for discovered checks from the rook\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n```\nNe4+\n```"
