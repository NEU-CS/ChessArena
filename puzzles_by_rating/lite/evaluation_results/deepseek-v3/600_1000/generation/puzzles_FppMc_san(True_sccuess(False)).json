If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g6 with pawn on h7. White's king is relatively safe on h2.\n3. Key threats/opportunities:\n   - Black has doubled rooks on the c-file threatening the back rank\n   - White has a strong knight on d4 and active rook on e7\n   - The g6 pawn is a potential target\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Rxh7+: Immediate sacrifice to expose Black's king\n   - Nf5+: Forcing the king to move and gaining tempo\n   - Rg7: Pressuring the g6 pawn\n   - Bxg6: Removing the key defensive pawn\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rxh7+ looks very promising: Kxh7 2. Nf5+ forces the king to h6 (Kh8 allows Qh5#) and then we have Qh5+ with a mating attack\n- Bxg6 is also strong but gives Black more defensive resources\n- Nf5+ immediately is good but not as forcing as Rxh7+\nThe most forcing and decisive move is Rxh7+, leading to a forced mate or significant material gain.\n```\nRxh7+\n```"
