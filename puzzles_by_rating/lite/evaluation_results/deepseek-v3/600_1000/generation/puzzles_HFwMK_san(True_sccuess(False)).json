If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has 2 rooks, knight, 3 pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, 3 pawns. White is up a rook for a bishop, which is a significant material advantage.\n2. King safety: White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger. Black's king is stuck in the corner but protected by its pieces.\n3. Key features:\n   - Black has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n   - White has doubled rooks on the e-file and a rook on f7\n   - Black's bishop on b8 is quite passive\n   - White's knight is well-placed on b3\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Rc7+: Checks the king and forces it to move, possibly opening up the position\n   - Rxg4: Wins a pawn but might activate Black's rook\n   - Rf8: Pins the rook to the king\n   - Re8: Puts more pressure on the back rank\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rc7+ is very strong as it forces the king to move (either Kb8 or Ka8)\n- After Kb8, we can play Rxb5 winning a pawn while maintaining pressure\n- If Ka8, we can consider Rf8 next with strong threats\n- This keeps the initiative and prevents Black from activating their pieces\nThe move Rc7+ is the most forcing and maintains White's advantage most effectively.\n```\nRc7+\n```"
