If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

White's pieces are more active though.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on g5 and bishop on h6, putting pressure on f7\n- Black's king is still in the center (though castled kingside)\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's d4 knight is well-placed but could be challenged\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Nxf7 or Bg7+\n- Black needs to address the immediate pressure on f7 and h6 bishop\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bg7: trades off the dangerous h6 bishop but opens the g-file\n- Qxh2+: tempting but after Kxh2 Nf3+ Kg2 Nxe1+ Rxe1, Black is down material\n- Nf3+: interesting but after gxf3 Qxh6, Black's king is exposed\n- f6: blocks the bishop but weakens e6\n- Qd6: defends e6 and connects rooks\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Bg7 seems most principled, removing the strong bishop\n- Qxh2+ is too risky and loses material\n- Other moves either don't address the threats or create weaknesses\nThe best move is:\n```\nBg7\n```"
