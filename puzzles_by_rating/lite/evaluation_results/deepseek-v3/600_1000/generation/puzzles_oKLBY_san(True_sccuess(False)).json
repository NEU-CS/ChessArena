If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2 with limited pawn cover. Black's king is relatively safe on g8.\n3. Key threats/opportunities:\n   - Black's queen is centralized and can deliver checks\n   - White's bishop on f5 is quite strong\n   - White's queen on c1 is ready to counterattack\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Qg4+: Forcing check that wins the bishop after Kh1 Qxf5\n   - Qe4+: Another check that maintains pressure\n   - Nh3: Threatening to fork with Nf4+\n   - Qd2: Targeting the weak a2 pawn\nAfter careful consideration, Qg4+ seems strongest as it:\n- Forces the king to move (Kh1 is forced)\n- Wins the bishop next move (Qxf5)\n- Maintains initiative\n- Doesn't allow White counterplay\nOther moves like Qe4+ are also good but don't win material immediately. Nh3 allows White counterplay with Qc4+.\nHere's the move:\n```\nQg4+\n```"
