When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, knight, queen vs White's rook, bishop, queen). The pawn structure is roughly balanced.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on f7, while White's king is safer on h1. White has pressure along the e-file and from the bishop on b2.\n3. Key observations:\n- White's rook on e3 is very active, eyeing the e6 pawn and potentially the f3 square\n- Black's queen on c5 is well placed, attacking b4 and e3\n- Black's rooks are doubled on the 8th rank but not very active\n- White's bishop pair could become dangerous if the position opens up\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5d6: Centralizing the queen and defending e6 pawn\n- f6d5: Knight move attacking e3 and b4\n- h8h4: Rook lift to create threats\n- f7g7: Improving king safety\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- f6d5 looks tempting but after exd5 Qxd5, White can play Qe2 with pressure\n- c5d6 is solid but somewhat passive\n- h8h4 is interesting but may be premature\n- f7g7 is probably best, improving king safety before activating other pieces\nThe move f7g7 gets the king to a safer square and prepares to connect the rooks. It also avoids potential future checks along the e-file or diagonal.\nHere's the move:\n```\nf7g7\n```"
