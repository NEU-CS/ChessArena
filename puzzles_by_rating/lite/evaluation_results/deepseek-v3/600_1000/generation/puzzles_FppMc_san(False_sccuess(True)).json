Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on e7 is very active\n- Black has doubled rooks on the c-file (c3 and c6)\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White has a passed g-pawn that could be dangerous\n- Black has a passed a-pawn that's not yet advanced\n3. Threats:\n- Black's rook on c3 is attacking White's bishop on b1\n- Black's rook on d6 is defending the d-file\n- White's knight has several active squares\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: e7h7 looks tempting to attack the h-pawn\n- Knight moves: d4e6+ forks king and rook\n- Bishop moves: b1g6 is a discovered attack on the king\n- Pawn moves: g4g5+ opens up the king\nAfter evaluating:\n- d4e6+ seems very strong as it forks the king and rook on c6. After Kxe6, White can play Re7+ winning the rook on d6.\n- b1g6 is also interesting as it threatens mate on f7, but Black can defend with Rf6.\n- e7h7 is good but doesn't create immediate threats.\nThe most forcing and winning line is d4e6+:\n1. d4e6+ Kxe6\n2. Re7+ Kf6 (only move)\n3. Rxd6 winning a rook\nThis leads to a clearly winning endgame for White.\n```\nd4e6\n```"
