When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is equal (both sides have king + 2 pawns)\n2. Both sides have passed pawns (White's d-pawn, Black's g-pawn)\n3. Black's king is more active, controlling key squares\n4. White's pawn structure is slightly better with the g3 pawn restraining Black's g4 pawn\nCandidate moves:\n1. Kd6 - centralizes king but allows Black to push e4\n2. Kc6 - moves away from the action, not ideal\n3. Kc5 - keeps pressure on e5 but may be too passive\n4. Kc4 - interesting, heading towards the queenside pawns\n5. d4 - immediately challenges Black's center\nAnalysis:\n- d4 seems most principled, opening the position when White's king is better placed\n- After d4 exd4, Kxd4 gives White a passed pawn and active king\n- Black would likely respond with Kf4, but White can then push g3+ or bring king to support the d-pawn\n- Other moves allow Black to consolidate or push e4, creating counterplay\nBest move is to open the position with:\n```\nd4\n```"
