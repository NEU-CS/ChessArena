If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g3, attacking g2 and h3\n- White's rook on a7 is somewhat passive\n- Black's bishop on e5 is strong, controlling key squares\n- White's king is exposed with weak pawns around it\n3. Threats:\n- Black has Qxh3+ threat after ...Qxg2+\n- Black could play ...Rf2 with strong pressure\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qg4: trades queens and relieves pressure, but gives up initiative\n- Qc4+: checks the king, but after ...Kh8 White has no follow-up\n- Rg7+: sacrifices the rook to expose Black's king\n- Bh6: threatens mate on g7, forcing Black to react\nAfter deep analysis, Rg7+ is the most promising move:\n- Rg7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n- Qxe5+ Kg8 (only move)\n- Qe6+ Kg7 (only move)\n- Qf6+ Kg8\n- Qg5+ with perpetual check or winning the queen\nThis forces Black into a series of only moves and leads to at least a draw by perpetual check, while keeping winning chances if Black makes a mistake.\n```\nRg7+\n```"
