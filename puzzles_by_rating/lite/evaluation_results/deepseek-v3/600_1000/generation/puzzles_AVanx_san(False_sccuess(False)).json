When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has knight vs Black's bishop, but otherwise balanced)\n2. Key features:\n   - White has a centralized knight on e5\n   - Black has a strong queen on g5 attacking g2\n   - Black's f4 knight is well-placed\n   - White's bishop on c2 is potentially strong on the a4-e8 diagonal\n   - White has a passed d-pawn but it's currently blocked\n3. Immediate threats:\n   - Black's queen is eyeing g2 pawn\n   - Black could play Qxg2# if White doesn't defend\n   - White needs to address this threat first\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Defending g2: g2g3 or g2g4\n   - Counterplay with knight moves (e5f7 looks tempting)\n   - Developing initiative with bishop moves (c2h7)\n5. Best options:\n   - g2g3 would block the queen but weaken dark squares\n   - e5f7 is a tempting sacrifice: 17...Kxf7 18.Qxf4+ winning the knight\n   - c2h7 is interesting but doesn't address immediate threats\nAfter careful consideration, e5f7 seems strongest as it:\n- Creates immediate threats\n- Wins material after 17...Kxf7 18.Qxf4+\n- Even if Black declines with Qxg2+, White has Qxg2 Nxg2 Kxg2 with advantage\nThe move e5f7 both defends against the immediate threat and creates counterplay.\n```\ne5f7\n```"
