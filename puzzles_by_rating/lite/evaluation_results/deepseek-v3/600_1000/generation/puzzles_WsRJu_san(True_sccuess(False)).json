If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal (Q+R vs Q+R+B, but White has more pawns).\n2. King safety: White king is exposed on b1, Black king is on b8. Both are vulnerable.\n3. Key features:\n- White has a passed e5 pawn\n- Black's queen is very active on a4, eyeing the white king\n- White's queen is on g7, very active near Black's king\n- Black has a bishop on f8 that's not doing much\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qxf8 - Wins the bishop but allows Black counterplay with Qa1+\n2. Qh8 - Threatening mate, but Black can defend with Qa1+ first\n3. Rg1 - Developing the rook to a more active position\n4. e6 - Pushing the passed pawn, but Black has Qa1+ first\nLet's calculate Qxf8:\n- Qxf8 Qa1+ Kc2 Qa2+ Kd3 Qxb2 (Black gets counterplay with the active queen)\nQh8:\n- Qh8 Qa1+ Kc2 Qa2+ Kd3 Qxb2 (similar issues)\nRg1:\n- Develops the rook, but doesn't create immediate threats\nBest option seems to be e6:\n- e6 Qa1+ Kc2 Qa2+ Kd3 Qxb2\n- Then Qxf8 and White's queen is very active near Black's king while having a passed e-pawn\nHowever, there's a better move - Qh7! (not listed in the legal moves, but appears to be legal - the queen can move to h7). Wait, looking at the FEN, the queen is on g8 (1k1r1bQ1), so Qh7 is indeed legal but not listed. This seems like an oversight in the legal moves provided.\nSince Qh7 isn't listed, the best among the given options is e6, creating a passed pawn and opening lines for the queen.\n```\ne6\n```"
