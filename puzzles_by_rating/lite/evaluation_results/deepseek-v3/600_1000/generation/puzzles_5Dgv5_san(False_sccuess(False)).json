When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has knight, bishop, rook vs White's knight, bishop, rook). White has doubled rooks on the f-file which could be dangerous.\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (c8) which is generally not ideal. White's king is on e2, also not castled but slightly safer.\n3. Piece activity:\n   - Black's knight on e5 is well placed but could be challenged\n   - White's bishop on g5 is very active, pinning the f8 rook to the king\n   - White's knight on c3 is well placed, controlling d5 and e4\n4. Key observations:\n   - The pin on the f8 rook is problematic and should be addressed\n   - White has potential to double rooks on the d-file after Rd1-d2\n   - Black needs to either break the pin or develop counterplay\n5. Candidate moves:\n   - g8e7: Breaking the pin by moving the king, but leaves the rook on f8\n   - f8e8: Moving the rook out of the pin, but blocks the king's escape\n   - e5f7: A knight move that attacks the bishop and breaks the pin\n   - e5g6: Another knight move, but less effective\n   - h8h7: Preparing to double rooks, but doesn't address the immediate pin\nThe best move appears to be e5f7, which:\n- Attacks the bishop on g5\n- Breaks the pin on the f8 rook\n- Maintains the knight's central presence\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\nOther options either don't address the pin or create new problems. For example, moving the king (g8e7) would still leave the rook vulnerable, and moving the rook (f8e8) would block the king's escape route.\nAfter e5f7, if White takes the knight (Bxf7), Black can recapture with Kxf7, solving the pin issue and maintaining material equality.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5f7\n```"
