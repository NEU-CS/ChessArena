When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has an extra knight while White has an extra bishop.\n2. King safety: White's king is somewhat exposed on f1. Black's king is safer on g8.\n3. Piece activity: Black's pieces are very active - queen on e6, rook on e8, rook on e5, knight on g3. White's queen on d4 is strong but needs support.\n4. Threats: Black's knight on g3 is attacking h1 and could potentially fork the king and rook. The doubled rooks on the e-file are putting pressure.\nNow let's evaluate the legal moves:\na) f1g1:\n- Gets the king to a safer position\n- Removes the king from the e-file where Black has doubled rooks\n- But leaves the h1 rook undefended against the knight\nb) f2g3:\n- Captures the annoying knight\n- Removes the immediate threat\n- But opens the f-file which might be dangerous\n- After fxg3, Black could play Qxg4 with threats\nAfter careful consideration, f1g1 seems better because:\n1. King safety is paramount in this position\n2. After f1g1, if Nxh1, we have Qxg7+! Kxg7, Rxh1 with a roughly equal position\n3. The knight on g3 is dangerous but not immediately winning\nThe alternative f2g3 leads to complications that favor Black after Qxg4.\n```\nf1g1\n```"
