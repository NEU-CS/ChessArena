When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a rook and 3 pawns vs Black's knight and 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more valuable than the knight in this endgame.\n2. King safety: White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger. Black's king is active but the g6 square is vulnerable to checks.\n3. Pawn structure: White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous if advanced. Black has connected passed pawns on the queenside.\n4. Immediate threats: Black's knight on d3 is attacking the f2 pawn. The Rh6+ check looks tempting to force Black's king away.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- Rh6+: Forces the king to move (either Kg7 or Kf7) and gains time\n- e5: Advances the passed pawn but allows Black counterplay\n- Kg4: Centralizes the king but might be premature\n- f4: Secures the f-pawn but weakens e4\nAfter considering:\n- Rh6+ is the most forcing move, creating immediate threats\n- After Rh6+ Kf7 (if Kg7 then Rg6+ wins the g5 pawn), White can play e5 with strong pressure\n- Other moves either don't create threats or allow Black counterplay\nThe best move is:\n```\nRh6+\n```"
