If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Material count:\n- Black has king, bishop, queen, bishop, rook, and 5 pawns\n- White has king, queen, rook, and 4 pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (Black may be slightly better)\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on h5\n- Black's queen and bishop battery on the c8-h3 diagonal is strong\n- White's rook on g3 is unprotected\n- Black's rook on d2 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on e1\n3. Threats:\n- White has Qh5 threatening the f7 pawn\n- Black has potential threats with the queen and rook\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxg3+: Wins the rook immediately, but after hxg3 Bxg3+ Ke2, Black's attack continues\n- Rf2: Defends f7 while keeping the rook active\n- Qd6: Centralizes the queen and maintains pressure\n- Be5: Develops the bishop with tempo on the queen\nAfter careful consideration, Qxg3+ seems strongest as it:\n- Wins material (rook for queen)\n- Opens the g-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains attacking chances against White's exposed king\n- Even if White recaptures, Black has strong follow-up moves\nThe move Qxg3+ leads to forced material gain and maintains the initiative. Other moves either don't win material or allow White to consolidate.\n```\nQxg3+\n```"
