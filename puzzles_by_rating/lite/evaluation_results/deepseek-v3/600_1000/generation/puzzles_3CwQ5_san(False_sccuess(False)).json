When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except White has an extra pawn)\n2. White has a space advantage with pawns on d4 and c3 controlling central squares\n3. Black's pieces are somewhat cramped, especially the bishop on b8\n4. White's pieces are well coordinated - knight on d2 supports f3/e4, bishop on e3 is active\n5. Black's queen on c7 is slightly exposed\nCandidate moves to consider:\nA) e3h6 - Bishop sacrifice to open the h-file. After gxh6, Qxh7+ Kxh7, Nf3+ with attack, but Black can defend with ...Kg8 and White's compensation is unclear.\nB) d2e4 - Centralizing the knight, but Black can play ...f5 kicking it back.\nC) c2h7 - Queen sacrifice, but after ...Kxh7, Nf3+ Kg8, Ng5 Qe5 and Black defends.\nD) c3c4 - Pawn break to open queenside, but Black can respond ...bxc4.\nE) h2g4 - Preparing to transfer knight to f6 via h6, but Black can prevent this with ...h5.\nAfter careful consideration, the most promising move is **c3c4**, the pawn break on the queenside. This:\n1. Opens lines for White's pieces\n2. Creates potential weaknesses in Black's pawn structure\n3. If Black takes ...bxc4, White recaptures with b3xc4, maintaining central control\n4. If Black doesn't take, White can push c4-c5, cramping Black further\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or are too speculative. The pawn break is the most principled approach.\n```\nc3c4\n```"
