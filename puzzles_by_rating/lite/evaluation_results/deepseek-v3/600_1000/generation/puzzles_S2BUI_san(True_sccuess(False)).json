When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, bishop, pawns\n- Black has rook, bishop, rook, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (Q+B vs R+B+R), but White's queen is very active\n2. King safety:\n- White king is relatively safe on g2\n- Black king is exposed on h8\n3. Key observations:\n- Black has doubled rooks on the e-file\n- Black's bishop on g7 is blocked by its own pawn on g6\n- White's queen is very active on b6\n- Black's c7 rook is undefended\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxc7: Wins a rook but allows Black to play Rxe2 with counterplay\n- Qb8+: Forces the black king to move, but then what?\n- Qxg6: Wins a pawn but opens lines for Black's rooks\n- Qb7: Centralizes the queen and maintains pressure\n5. Best move seems to be Qxc7:\n- Immediate material gain (rook for nothing)\n- After Rxe2, White can play Qd8+ Kh7 Qxd4, maintaining material advantage\n- Black's counterplay with Rxe2 is not too dangerous as White can defend\nOther options:\n- Qb8+ Kh7 Qxc7 is similar but gives Black an extra tempo\n- Qxg6 hxg6 Bxg6 is interesting but unclear\n- Qb7 maintains pressure but doesn't win material immediately\nAfter careful consideration, Qxc7 is the most forcing and concrete winning move.\n```\nQxc7\n```"
