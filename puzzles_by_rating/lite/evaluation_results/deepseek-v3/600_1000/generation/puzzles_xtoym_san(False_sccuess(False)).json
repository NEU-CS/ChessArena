When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a material advantage with Rook+Bishop vs Rook+Bishop, but Black has connected passed pawns on d5 and c2.\n2. Black's c2 pawn is very dangerous and threatens to promote soon.\n3. White's a5 pawn is passed but not immediately threatening.\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8.\nThe most critical aspects are:\n- Stopping Black's c2 pawn from promoting\n- Activating White's pieces to create threats\n- Dealing with Black's immediate threats\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b7b3 - attacks the c2 pawn directly\n2. d4c3 - blocks the c2 pawn's path\n3. a1c1 - pins the c2 pawn\n4. b7c7 - attacks the c2 pawn indirectly by pinning the rook\nLet's evaluate these:\n1. b7b3:\n   - Immediately attacks the c2 pawn\n   - But after ...c1Q, White can take with Rxc1 Rxc1, but Black's d5 pawn becomes dangerous\n   - Not the most precise\n2. d4c3:\n   - Blocks the pawn's path\n   - But after ...Rxc3, White loses the bishop and the pawn still promotes\n   - Not sufficient\n3. a1c1:\n   - Pins the pawn to the rook\n   - After ...Rxc1, Rxc1 and the pawn is stopped\n   - But Black can play ...Bc5 attacking the rook\n   - Might lead to complications\n4. b7c7:\n   - Pins the rook to the king\n   - If ...Rxc7, then Bxc7 and the c2 pawn is blocked\n   - If Black doesn't take, White can double rooks on the c-file\n   - This seems most promising\nAfter careful consideration, b7c7 is the strongest move as it:\n- Creates an immediate pin\n- Either wins the exchange or stops the c-pawn\n- Maintains White's active piece play\nThe move is:\n```\nb7c7\n```"
