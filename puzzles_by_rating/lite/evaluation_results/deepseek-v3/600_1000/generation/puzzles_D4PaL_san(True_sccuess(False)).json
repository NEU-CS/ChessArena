When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rooks, minor pieces, etc.)\n2. White has a strong queen on h5 attacking f7 and eyeing potential checks\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n4. White has castled kingside while Black's king is still in the center\n5. White has a space advantage with pawns on f4 and d4\nKey observations:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active and threatening\n- Black needs to address the immediate threats while developing counterplay\n- The f7 pawn is under pressure from White's queen\n- Black's queen is well placed on f6 controlling important squares\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qh6 - trades queens but leaves Black's king exposed\n2. Qg6 - blocks the g-pawn but allows Qxg6 hxg6, opening h-file\n3. Kh8 - gets out of potential checks but doesn't solve other problems\n4. Rfe8 - develops rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n5. Qe5 - centralizes queen and defends f7\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qe5 seems most principled:\n  - Defends f7 pawn\n  - Centralizes the queen\n  - Maintains pressure on e3 pawn\n  - Keeps options for future play\n- Other moves either weaken the position or don't address immediate concerns\nThe move Qe5 also prepares potential ...Rfe8 next, bringing the rook to a more active position.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQe5\n```"
