When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's pawn structure is slightly compromised with isolated pawns\n4. Black's pieces are well coordinated, especially the bishops on f6 and g4\n5. White's king is somewhat exposed due to the advanced pawn on h3\nKey observations:\n- The bishop on g4 is very active, pinning the knight on f3 to the queen on e2\n- The rook on f8 could potentially double on the f-file\n- The queen on c7 has multiple options to improve its position\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g4h3 - Breaking the pin and threatening to win material\n2. f6d4 - Centralizing the bishop with tempo\n3. c7e5 - Improving the queen's position and eyeing the kingside\n4. f8f3 - Sacrificing the exchange to break White's position\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g4h3 looks very strong as it breaks the pin and threatens to win the knight after ...Bxf3\n- If White recaptures Qxf3, then Qxf3 wins a piece\n- Even if White finds a way to defend, Black gains significant positional advantages\nThe move g4h3 seems most promising as it immediately challenges White's position and creates concrete threats.\n```\ng4h3\n```"
