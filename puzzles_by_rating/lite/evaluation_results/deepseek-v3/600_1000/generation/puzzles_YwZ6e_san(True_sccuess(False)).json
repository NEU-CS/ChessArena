When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black has a knight on g3 attacking our pawn on h2\n3. Our queen is centralized on d4, but Black's queen on e6 is also active\n4. Black has a rook on e8 and e5, controlling central files\n5. Our king is somewhat exposed on f1\nCandidate moves:\n1. Kg1 - This gets the king to safety but allows fxg3 next move\n2. fxg3 - Takes the knight but opens the f-file\nLet's evaluate fxg3:\n- After fxg3, Black can play Qxg4+ forking our king and rook\n- Then after Kh1, Black has Qxh3+ winning another pawn\n- This leads to a clearly worse position\nKg1 looks safer:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- If Black takes with Nxh1, we have Qxg7#!\n- So Black would likely play something else like ...Qe4+ or ...Re4\nAfter Kg1, if Black plays Qe4+:\n- Qxe4 Rxe4\n- Then fxg3 is safe as the queen fork threat is gone\n- We'd have a roughly equal endgame\nTherefore, Kg1 is the better choice as it maintains equality and avoids immediate tactical disasters.\n```\nKg1\n```"
