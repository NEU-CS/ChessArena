When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on a4 is eyeing the black pawn on e4\n- Black's queen on b6 is well placed, attacking a6 pawn\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's king is on f1, not ideal but safe for now\n- Both sides have passed pawns (a6 for White, e4 for Black)\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxe4 next move if we don't defend it\n- Our queen is attacking the a6 pawn\n- We need to consider king safety\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Defend e4 pawn: Qb6e6 or Qb6d6\nb) King moves: g8h8 or g8f8\nc) Queen moves to attack: Qb6b1 or Qb6b2\nd) Push pawns: e4e3 or h6h5\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qb6e6 defends e4 but blocks our own pawn\n- King moves don't improve our position\n- Qb6b1 looks tempting but allows Qxe4\n- e4e3 is interesting but gives up the pawn\n- Qb6d6 is best as it defends e4 while keeping the queen active\nThe move Qb6d6:\n- Defends e4 pawn\n- Keeps queen centralized\n- Maintains pressure on a6 pawn\n- Doesn't block any important squares\nOther options either give up material or don't improve our position. Qb6d6 is the most solid move that maintains our advantages.\n```\nb6d6\n```"
