When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has Q+R+N vs White's Q+R+N)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a centralized knight on e6 that's very active\n- Black's queen is active but potentially exposed on a4\n- White has a passed pawn on the queenside (b2)\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on c8\n- White's king is safer on d1\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qc4 attacking the queen and threatening Qxc5\n- White could play Rd1-d8+ at some point\n- The e6 knight is very strong and could support a kingside attack\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8h8 (rook to h-file to potentially support kingside play)\n- f6d7 (knight retreat to defend c5 pawn)\n- a4d7 (queen to d7 to defend knight and connect rooks)\n- c8b8 (king to safer square)\n5. Best move considerations:\n- e8h8 looks interesting to activate the rook\n- f6d7 defends c5 but blocks the queen's defense of d7\n- a4d7 seems most solid, connecting rooks and defending the knight\n- Need to watch out for Qc4 ideas from White\nAfter careful consideration, a4d7 is the most solid move:\n- Connects the rooks\n- Defends the knight on f6\n- Maintains control of d-file\n- Keeps options open for both defense and counterplay\nThe move also prevents any immediate tactical threats from White like Qc4 or Rd8+ ideas.\n```\na4d7\n```"
