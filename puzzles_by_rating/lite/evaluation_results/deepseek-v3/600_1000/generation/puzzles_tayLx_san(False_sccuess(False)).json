When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White: R, Q, 3P; Black: R, Q, 4P). The black king is slightly more exposed.\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a queen on c4 attacking b4 pawn\n- White's queen is very active on e3\n- Black's rook on e6 is undefended\n- White's rook on d1 could become more active\n- Black's pawn structure has weaknesses (isolated c6, backward d3)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3e6: Capturing the undefended rook (Qxe6)\n- d1d3: Pinning the d3 pawn to the king\n- b4b5: Creating passed pawn potential\n- e3a7: Threatening the f7 pawn\n4. Analysis of e3e6 (Qxe6):\n- Immediate material gain (rook for queen)\n- After Qxe6, Black can play Qxb4 with counterplay\n- White would have Q+R vs Q, but Black's king is exposed\n5. Analysis of d1d3:\n- Pins the d3 pawn to the king\n- Black would likely play Qxb4 in response\n- Then White can play Qxd3 with a strong position\n6. Analysis of b4b5:\n- Creates a passed pawn threat\n- But allows Black to play Qxb5 with counterplay\n7. Best move appears to be e3e6 (Qxe6), winning the rook:\n- After Qxe6 Qxb4, White has Q+R vs Q\n- White's pieces are more active\n- Black's king remains exposed\n- White can follow up with Rd1-d7 or similar to increase pressure\nThe material gain and subsequent activity outweigh the loss of the b4 pawn.\n```\ne3e6\n```"
