When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has king on a7, pawns on b7, a5, e3, h6, and bishop on b6\n- White has king on g2, pawn on g3, queen on d5, and bishop on h2\n- Material is roughly equal (Black has 3 pawns vs White's 1, but White has queen vs bishop)\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen is very active on d5, attacking b7 and h5\n- Black's king is exposed on a7\n- White's bishop on h2 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal\n- Black's e3 pawn is passed but blockaded by White's king\n- Black's queen on e1 is somewhat trapped\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxb7+ winning the pawn\n- White also has potential mating threats with Qa8+ and Qb8#\n- Black needs to address these threats immediately\n4. Candidate moves:\n- a7b8: moves king away from danger but into potential checks\n- b6d8: blocks the a8-h1 diagonal but leaves b7 pawn hanging\n- e1b4: queen moves to attack g4 square and defend b7\n- e1g3: queen can capture the g3 pawn with check\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e1g3 seems most forcing as it gives check and wins a pawn\n- After Kxg3, Black can play Qe1+ with perpetual checks\n- Other moves either lose material or allow White's threats\nThe best move is to take the pawn with check:\n```\ne1g3\n```"
