When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: king, pawns on b6/b7/h6, rook on f2\n- White has: king on e3, bishop on d3, knight on e5, pawn on c4\n- Material is roughly equal (Black has rook vs White's minor pieces)\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White's knight on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's rook is active on the 2nd rank\n- White's pawn on c4 is passed but blockaded by b6\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Nc6 or Nxg6\n- Black needs to activate the rook while keeping the king safe\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f6g7: King moves to safer square but allows Nxg6\n- f6e7: King centralizes but may be exposed\n- f2f5: Rook cuts off white king, attacks e5 knight\n- h6h5: Pawn move to create luft but doesn't address immediate concerns\nAfter careful consideration, f2f5 seems strongest because:\n- It attacks the powerful e5 knight\n- Cuts off the white king from entering the position\n- Maintains rook activity\n- Doesn't expose the black king further\nOther moves either expose the king too much or don't address the immediate threats.\n```\nf2f5\n```"
