If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Knight, Bishop, Rook, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, King, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has minor pieces vs Black's rook)\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on b2\n- Black has doubled rooks on the g-file\n- White's pawn on g2 is under attack by Rg3\n- Black's pawn structure is solid but has some weaknesses (e4 pawn is isolated)\n- White's knight on a4 is well placed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxg2: Immediate capture, but after Kxg2 Rg8+ Kh1, White might consolidate\n- Rxb3+: Interesting sacrifice, but after Kxb3 Rg3+ Kc2 Rxg2, Black has compensation but not clearly winning\n- Rg4: Prepares to double rooks and attack g2 from another angle\n- Kf6: Centralizing the king\n- g5: Pushing the pawn to create space\nAfter careful consideration, Rxb3+ seems the most promising:\n- It's a forcing move that creates immediate complications\n- After Kxb3 Rg3+ Kc2 Rxg2, Black gets the pawn back and has active pieces\n- White's king remains exposed\n- Black can follow up with moves like Rg3-h3 or e3 to keep the initiative\nThe alternatives either don't create enough pressure or allow White to consolidate. The sacrifice keeps the initiative and maintains attacking chances.\n```\nRxb3+\n```"
