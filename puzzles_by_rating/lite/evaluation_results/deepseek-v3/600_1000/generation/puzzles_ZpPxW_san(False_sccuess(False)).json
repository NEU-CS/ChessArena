When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has an extra pawn (c4) but it's isolated.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8, while White's king is safer on g1.\n3. Key features:\n   - White has pressure on the f-file with Rf7\n   - Black's queen is very active on e5\n   - Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on c7\n   - White's queen on f2 is well placed\n4. Threats:\n   - White threatens to play Qf6+ winning the bishop\n   - Black needs to address this while maintaining activity\n5. Candidate moves:\n   - e5f6: Giving up the queen but winning material after ...Qxf6 Rxf6 Bxf6\n   - e8f8: Defending f7 but allowing Qf6+\n   - e6f7: Blocking the f-file but allowing Rxf7\n   - g8h8: Moving the king away from potential checks\nThe best move appears to be e5f6, forcing a queen trade that leads to a favorable endgame:\n1. Qxf6 Rxf6\n2. Bxf6 and Black is up a bishop for a pawn in the resulting position.\nThis leads to a winning endgame for Black due to the extra piece and White's weak pawn structure.\n```\ne5f6\n```"
