When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a strong queen on h5 attacking f7 and eyeing potential checks\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n4. White has castled while Black's king is still in the center\n5. White has a space advantage with pawns on f4 and d4\nKey observations:\n- White's queen is very active and threatening\n- Black needs to address the immediate threats while developing counterplay\n- The f7 pawn is under pressure from White's queen\n- Black's queen is well placed on f6 defending f7\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qh6 - trades queens but leaves Black's king exposed\n2. Qg6 - blocks the g-pawn but allows Qxg6 hxg6 weakening kingside\n3. Kh8 - gets the king off the open file but doesn't solve other issues\n4. Rfe8 - develops the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n5. g6 - defends against Qxf7+ but weakens dark squares\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g6 seems necessary to prevent Qxf7+ which would be devastating\n- After g6, if Qh4 we can consider Qg7 to defend\n- This maintains material equality while securing the king\nThe best move is:\n```\ng6\n```"
