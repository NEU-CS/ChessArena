If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on h4 is threatening mate in 1 with Qh2#\n- Black's rook on e3 is attacking the f3 pawn\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Kg1: Gets the king away from the h-file but allows Qh2+ followed by Qxf2 winning material\n- Kf1: Also gets the king away but still allows Qh1+ winning the rook\n- g3: The only move that prevents immediate mate\nAfter careful consideration, g3 is the only move that prevents immediate checkmate. While it loses the pawn to Qxg3+, it's better than getting mated. The position remains difficult but playable.\n```\ng3\n```"
