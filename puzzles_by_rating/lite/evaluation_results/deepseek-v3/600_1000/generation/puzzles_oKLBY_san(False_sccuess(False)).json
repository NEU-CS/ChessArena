When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal but Black's pieces are more active.\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black's queen is very active on d4\n- White's bishop on f5 is strong but can be challenged\n- Black has potential threats against the exposed white king\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) d4f6 - attacking the bishop and threatening discovered checks\nb) d4h4 - direct attack on the king\nc) f2g4 - developing the knight with threats\nd) g7g5 - preparing to open the g-file\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- d4f6 looks very strong as it forces the bishop to move or be captured, and opens up potential discovered checks\n- After 1...Qxf6 2.Qxf6 Bxf6, Black would have bishop vs knight in an open position which is favorable\n- Alternatively if White moves the bishop, Black gets strong initiative\nThe most forcing and advantageous move appears to be taking the bishop immediately:\n```\nd4f6\n```\nThis wins material while maintaining pressure on White's position. The alternatives either don't win material or allow White to consolidate."
