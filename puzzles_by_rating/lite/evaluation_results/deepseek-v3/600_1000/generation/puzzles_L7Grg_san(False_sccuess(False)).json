When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Bishop, Knight, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, King, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (rook vs bishop+knight), but the position is very sharp.\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e3\n- Black's rook is actively placed on g2\n- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black has connected passed pawns on the queenside (b6 and a7)\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to play Nf4 attacking the rook\n- Black can consider checking the white king or advancing pawns\n4. Candidate moves:\na) f7g8 - King moves to safety but doesn't accomplish much\nb) g2g3 - Pinning the g3 pawn, but allows Kf3\nc) g2e2 - Checking the king, forcing it to move\nd) b6b5 - Advancing the passed pawn\ne) h7h5 - Preventing h4-h5 advance\n5. Best move analysis:\n- g2e2+ looks strong as it forces the king to move:\n  - If Ke3-f3, then Rf2+ wins the bishop\n  - If Ke3-d3, then Rd2+ wins the knight\n  - If Ke3-f4, then Rf2+ wins the bishop\nThis seems like a forced win of material.\nTherefore, the best move is to check the king with the rook:\n```\ng2e2\n```"
