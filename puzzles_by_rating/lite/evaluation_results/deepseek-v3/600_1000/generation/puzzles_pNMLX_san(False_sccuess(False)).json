When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: Rook (a8), Rook (b1), King (f8), pawns (e7, d6, g6, f5, h5)\n- White has: Rook (b7), Bishop (b6), Bishop (c6), pawns (d5, h4, g3, f2, g2), King (g2)\n2. Positional factors:\n- White has a strong bishop pair and active pieces\n- Black's king is exposed and under pressure\n- White's pawn structure is more solid\n- Black's rooks are not well coordinated\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Rb8+ winning the rook\n- White has potential mating threats with the bishops\n- Black needs to address the immediate threat to the a8 rook\n4. Candidate moves:\na) f8g8 - moves king away from potential checks but leaves rook vulnerable\nb) a8b8 - defends the rook but allows Rbxb8 Rxb8 Bxb8 winning material\nc) b1b6 - counterattack on the bishop, but after Bxb6 Rxb6 Rxb6 axb6, Black loses material\nd) e7e6 - creates a pawn break but doesn't address the immediate threat\ne) f8f7 - moves king towards center but exposes it to checks\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to sacrifice the rook to eliminate one of White's powerful bishops, as material loss is inevitable but this minimizes the damage:\n```\nb1b6\n```\nThis forces White to take with the bishop (Bxb6), after which Black can recapture with the pawn (axb6). While Black remains down material, this eliminates one of White's dangerous bishops and opens the a-file for potential counterplay. All other moves lead to more significant material loss or immediate checkmate threats."
