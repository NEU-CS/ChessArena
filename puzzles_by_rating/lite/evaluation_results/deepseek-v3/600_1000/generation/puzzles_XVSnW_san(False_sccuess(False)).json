When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (c1), Knight (c5), Queen (e3), Rook (g1), pawns (a2,b2,c3,g2,h3)\n- Black has: Rook (f3), Bishop (e4), Queen (h4), Rook (h6), pawns (a6,b7,d5,e5,g7)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on h4 is threatening mate on h2\n- Black's rook on f3 is pinning White's g2 pawn to the king\n- White's knight on c5 is very active and has several options\n- White's queen is centralized but needs to be careful about Black's threats\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) c5e4 - attacking the bishop and queen, but after ...Bxe4 Qxe4 Qxh3 is dangerous\nb) e3h6 - exchanging queens, but after ...Rxh6, Black still has threats\nc) g2g3 - blocking the queen's threat, but ...Qxh3 is possible\nd) h1h2 - defending against mate, but allows ...Rxh3\ne) c5d7 - attacking the rook on f3 indirectly\nAfter careful consideration, c5d7 seems strongest:\n- It attacks the rook on f3\n- If ...Rxf2, then Rxf2 and White is better\n- If ...Rf5, then Qe4 is strong\n- It maintains control of the position while reducing Black's threats\nOther moves either allow dangerous counterplay or don't address Black's threats sufficiently.\n```\nc5d7\n```"
