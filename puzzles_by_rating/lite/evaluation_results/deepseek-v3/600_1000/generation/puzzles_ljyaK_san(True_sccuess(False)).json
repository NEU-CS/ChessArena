If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's queen is on h4, threatening mate on h1\n4. White's king is somewhat exposed on e1\n5. Black has a rook on g8 and knight on h6\nThe most urgent threats:\n- Black is threatening Qxh2# if we don't defend\n- The pin on the knight is dangerous\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qxg8 - takes the rook but allows Qxh2#\n2. Qf8+ - checks the king but after Kxf8, we still lose to Qxh2#\n3. Qe4 - blocks the bishop's diagonal but allows Qxh2#\n4. Bf3 - blocks the queen's path to h2 but loses to Bxf3\n5. h3 - interrupts the queen's path but allows Bxh3\n6. Nh3 - blocks the queen but loses the knight to Qxh3\nAfter careful consideration, the only move that prevents immediate mate is:\n```\nh3\n```\nThis forces Black to either:\n- Take the pawn with Bxh3, after which we can play gxh3 Qxh3, and then we have Qxg8+ with counterplay\n- Or retreat the bishop, after which we can develop our pieces\nWhile it's not ideal, it's the only move that prevents immediate mate. All other moves either allow mate or lose material without compensation."
