If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Black's queen is very active on a4, eyeing the b3 square near White's king\n3. White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h4\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns on f7 and g7\n5. White has doubled rooks on the e-file\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rxf7 - Sacrificing the rook to expose Black's king\n2. Qxf7+ - Queen capture with check\n3. Re8 - Doubling rooks on the e-file\n4. R7e6 - Centralizing the rook\n5. h5 - Pushing the passed pawn\nLet's analyze Rxf7 first:\n- Rxf7 Kxf7 (forced)\n- Qxf7+ Kg8\n- Now if Qxb1+ Ka2 Qxa2+ Kxa2 and White has a winning endgame with the advanced h-pawn\nQxf7+ is similar but less forcing:\n- Qxf7+ Kh8 (if Kxf7 then Rxf7+ and White wins)\n- Then Black can defend with Qd1+ etc.\nRe8 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats.\nh5 is interesting but slow - Black can counter with Qb3 threatening mate.\nAfter careful consideration, Rxf7 is the most forcing and promising move, leading to a clear advantage after the sequence. The sacrifice opens up Black's king and leads to a winning endgame.\n```\nRxf7\n```"
