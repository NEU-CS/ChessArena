If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n2. Key threats/features:\n- Black's queen on h4 is threatening mate on h2 (Qxh2#)\n- Black's rook on f3 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e4 is pinning the white queen to the king\n- White's knight on c5 is well placed but needs to be careful about ...b6 trapping it\n3. Immediate priorities:\n- Must defend against Qxh2# threat\n- Need to deal with the pin on the queen\n- Would like to activate our rook on c1\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Kh2 - defends against mate but leaves queen pinned\n- g3 - blocks the mate threat but Qxh3 is possible\n- Qxh6 - sacrifices queen but may lead to complications\n- Qg5 - blocks the mate threat and attacks black's queen\n- Rgf1 - challenges the active rook on f3\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qg5 seems most promising as it:\n  * Blocks the mate threat\n  * Attacks black's queen\n  * Maintains our queen's activity\n  * Forces black to react to our move\nOther options:\n- Kh2 is too passive and leaves queen pinned\n- g3 allows Qxh3 with complications\n- Qxh6 gives up our strongest piece\n- Rgf1 doesn't address the mate threat\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQg5\n```"
