If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on b7\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n- White's knight on e5 is strong\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxc8+: Wins the rook but after Rxc8, Black's queen can defend\n- Qxf7+: Interesting sacrifice, but after Kxf7 Nxd5+ Ke8 Nxc7+ Kd7 Nxa8, Black gets compensation\n- Nxf7: Also a sacrifice, but unclear after Kxf7 Qxc8\n- Qxd5: Simplifies to an equal endgame\n- Re4: Defends d4 and prepares to double rooks\n4. Best move seems to be Qxc8+:\n- Forces the exchange of queens and rooks\n- After Rxc8 Rxc8 Qxc8 Nxc8, White has knight vs bishop in an endgame\n- White's king is safer and knight can target weak pawns\n- The passed c-pawn is blockaded by the knight\nThis leads to a favorable endgame for White. Other moves either don't achieve as much or lead to unclear complications.\n```\nQxc8+\n```"
