If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a bishop pair vs White's bishop+knight, but White has a passed b-pawn)\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on b7 (protected by the queen)\n- Black's king is exposed in the center\n- White has pressure on g7 (bishop on g5)\n- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxc7 winning a pawn\n- White also has potential threats against g7 (Bxh7 ideas)\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Nf6: Develops the knight and defends against Qxc7\n- Qe7: Connects rooks and defends c7\n- exf4: Opens the position but gives White's bishop more scope\n- Bb6: Challenges the strong queen on b7\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Nf6 seems most natural, developing a piece and defending c7\n- Qe7 is passive and blocks the bishop\n- exf4 gives White's bishop more scope on the diagonal\n- Bb6 allows Qxb6 axb6 when White's passed pawn becomes very dangerous\nThe best move appears to be Nf6, which develops a piece, defends c7, and prepares to castle. It also keeps options open for counterplay in the center.\n```\nNf6\n```"
