If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on c4, attacking b4 pawn\n- White's queen is centralized on e3\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3\n- Black's rook is active on e6\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxe6: Trading queens while winning the rook, but after fxe6 White's position remains difficult due to the passed d-pawn\n- Qxh6: Winning a pawn but allowing Black counterplay with Qe2+\n- Rxd3: Eliminating the dangerous passed pawn immediately\n- Qc5+: Forcing the black king to move and potentially gaining time\n4. Deepest analysis:\n- Rxd3 seems most principled, removing Black's most dangerous asset. After Rxd3 Qxd3, White can play Qxe6 fxe6 and the position is equal but easier to play for White with the passed b-pawn.\n- Qc5+ forces Ke8 (Kf7?? Qe7#) and then White can consider Rxd3 with a better version than immediate Rxd3.\nAfter careful consideration, forcing the black king to move first with check seems most precise:\n```\nQc5+\n```\nThis gains a tempo before capturing the d3 pawn, and maintains more options for White. After Ke8, White can then decide whether to take on d3 or consider other moves like Qb6 or Qe5 with a strong initiative."
