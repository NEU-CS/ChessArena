If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on g4\n- Black's queen is on a5, somewhat out of play\n- White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black's f7 pawn is a potential target\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxg7+: Immediate sacrifice, but after Kxg7 Rb7+ Kf8 Rxf7+ Ke8, Black can defend\n- Nf5: Centralizes knight with threats\n- Ng6+: Forks king and rook, but after hxg6 Qxg6 Qd8 defends\n- Rb8: Pinning the rook to the king\n- Qh5: Threatening mate on h7\nAfter careful consideration, Qh5 is very strong:\n- Threatens Qh7# which Black must address\n- If Black plays Qd8 to defend h7, then Nf5! threatens both Qh7# and Ne7+ winning the rook\n- If Black plays g6, Qh6 maintains the mating threats while the knight can still join the attack\nOther moves like Qxg7+ are tempting but give Black more defensive resources. Qh5 keeps all the pressure while maintaining material advantage.\n```\nQh5\n```"
