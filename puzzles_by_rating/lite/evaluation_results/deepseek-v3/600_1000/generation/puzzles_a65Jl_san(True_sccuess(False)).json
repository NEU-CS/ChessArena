If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on b6\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- Black has a passed pawn on e6\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but safe for now\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxe6: Capturing the passed pawn immediately\n- Rb5+: Checking the king to gain tempo\n- g4+: Forcing the black king to move\n- Rd6: Attacking the bishop\n4. Deep analysis:\n- Rxe6 Kxe6 leads to a pawn endgame where White has 4 vs 3 pawns on the kingside, but Black's king is more active. This might be drawish.\n- Rb5+ Ke4 (Kf4 allows Rxb7 with advantage) and Black's king becomes more active\n- g4+ Kxg4 is bad as it opens lines for Black's king\n- Rd6 Bc4 and Black holds\n- Rb7 looks interesting, threatening to win the f7 pawn\nAfter careful consideration, Rb7 seems strongest:\n- It threatens to win the f7 pawn next move (Rxf7+)\n- If Black defends with Kg6, then Rxa6 wins a pawn\n- If Black plays Bc4, then Rc7 wins the bishop\n- It maintains all of White's advantages while creating concrete threats\nThe other moves either don't improve White's position or lead to unnecessary complications. Rb7 is the most precise move to press the advantage.\n```\nRb7\n```"
