When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a slight initiative due to piece activity.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on e5 and active bishop on d3\n- Black's king is still in the center (f8)\n- Black's a1 bishop is hanging and needs to be addressed\n- White's queen on d4 is very active, eyeing the h8-a1 diagonal\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a1d4: Trading the bishop for the strong queen, but after Qxd4, White maintains pressure\n- c8d7: Developing the bishop while protecting the a1 bishop\n- f8e8: Getting the king to safety\n- d8e7: Connecting rooks and developing the queen\n4. Best options:\n- c8d7 seems most logical, developing a piece while protecting the a1 bishop. After this, Black can consider castling next move.\n- a1d4 is tempting but gives White too much initiative after recapturing with the queen.\n- f8e8 is premature as the king isn't in immediate danger yet.\n5. Potential threats:\nWhite could play Qh4+ next move if we don't address the king safety, but that's not immediately crushing.\nAfter careful consideration, developing the bishop while protecting our hanging piece is the most solid choice.\n```\nc8d7\n```"
