If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Knight vs Black's Rook, Queen, Bishop\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n2. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on h1\n- Black king is on g7, also somewhat exposed\n3. Key threats:\n- Black has a discovered attack possibility with Rd2-d1+\n- Black's queen on d1 is very active\n- White's rook on c7 is very active\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxg7+ is tempting but after Kxg7, Qh5 threatens mate but Black has Qg4 blocking\n- Rxb7 removes Black's strong bishop but allows Rd1+ with complications\n- Qxd2 is possible but after Qxd2, we lose our active queen\n- Rf7 looks interesting, keeping pressure on f6 and preventing Rd1+\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rxg7+ seems most forcing: 1. Rxg7+ Kxg7 2. Qh5 (threatening Qxh6#) 2...Qg4 3. Qxg4+ fxg4 and we're up a pawn but it's unclear\n- Rf7 is more positional, maintaining pressure and preventing counterplay\nThe best move appears to be Rf7, maintaining control and preventing Black's counterplay with Rd1+.\n```\nRf7\n```"
