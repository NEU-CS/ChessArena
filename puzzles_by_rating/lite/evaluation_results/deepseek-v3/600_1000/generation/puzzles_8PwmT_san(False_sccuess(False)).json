When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, rook, bishop, pawns). White has a passed pawn on b5 and a strong central pawn on d5.\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on d3 is very active, eyeing Black's kingside.\n- Black's queen on a7 is somewhat passive.\n- Black's king is exposed with only rook and bishop covering.\n- White has a space advantage with central pawns.\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d1h5: Queen lift to attack kingside, threatening h7\n- f1f7: Rook sacrifice to expose the king (but seems premature)\n- d5d6: Pushing the central passed pawn\n- b5b6: Advancing the queenside passed pawn\n4. Calculating d1h5:\n- After d1h5, Black has several options:\n  - g7g6 blocks but weakens dark squares\n  - f7f6 blocks but creates weaknesses\n  - Other moves allow Qxh7+ with a strong attack\n5. Calculating d5d6:\n- Opens the position but gives Black counterplay with cxd6\n- After cxd6, White can recapture with Bxd6 but Black gets activity\n6. Calculating b5b6:\n- Solid advance but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Black can respond with a7b8 or other moves\nThe most promising seems d1h5, creating immediate threats against Black's king while maintaining all positional advantages. The queen lift puts maximum pressure on Black's position and can lead to a decisive attack.\nAfter thorough consideration, the best move is:\n```\nd1h5\n```"
