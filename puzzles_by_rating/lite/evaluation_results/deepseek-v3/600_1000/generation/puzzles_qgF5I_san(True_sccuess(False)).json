If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns each). Black has a knight on d4 that's well-placed.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's knight on d4 is strong, controlling key squares\n- White has doubled rooks on the d-file\n- Black's queen is on a8, not very active yet\n- White's queen is centralized on e2\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Nd5: Challenges Black's strong knight, but after exd5 Qxd5, Black gets the bishop pair\n- Rxd4: Immediate capture, but after exd4, Black gets strong central pawns\n- Qxe6: Looks tempting but after fxe6 Rxd8+ Kf7, White loses material\n- Ne4: Develops the knight to a good square, attacking f6 pawn\n- Qe5: Centralizes the queen more, putting pressure\n4. Best move seems to be Ne4:\n- Develops the knight to an active square\n- Attacks the f6 pawn\n- Prepares to possibly jump to d6 or f6 later\n- Maintains flexibility in the position\n- Doesn't allow Black any immediate counterplay\nOther options either lose material (Qxe6), give up control (Rxd4), or don't improve the position enough. Ne4 is the most principled move here, improving piece activity while maintaining all options.\n```\nNe4\n```"
