When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a knight and bishop for rook and pawn, but positionally Black seems better)\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's bishop on e6 is very strong, controlling important squares\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on c6\n- Black has a knight fork opportunity with e7d5\n- White's pawn structure has some weaknesses (isolated d-pawn)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6d6: King moves away from potential checks, but doesn't accomplish much\n- c6b6: King moves toward safety but away from center\n- c6b5: King becomes too exposed\n- d8d5: Queen move attacking pawn, but allows white to defend\n- e7d5: Knight fork attacking both bishop and pawn\n4. Best move analysis:\ne7d5 is very strong because:\n- It forks the bishop on e6 and pawn on d5\n- After exd5, Black can play Qxd5 with strong central control\n- White cannot defend both pieces\n- Even if White plays Bxd7, Black recaptures with Kxd7 and maintains advantage\n5. Other moves are clearly inferior:\n- King moves don't address the immediate tactical opportunity\n- Qd5 allows White to defend with Qd2 or similar\nTherefore, the best move is the knight fork:\n```\ne7d5\n```"
