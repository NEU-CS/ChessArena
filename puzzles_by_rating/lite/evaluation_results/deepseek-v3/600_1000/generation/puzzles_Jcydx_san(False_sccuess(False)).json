When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight, and pawns)\n2. White has a centralized knight on e4 and bishop pair\n3. Black has strong bishops on e5 and f5, but the f5 bishop is somewhat loose\n4. White has pressure on the a1-h8 diagonal with bishop on c2\n5. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced on g6 and h7\nKey observations:\n- White's knight on e4 is very strong and needs to be challenged\n- Black's bishop on f5 is vulnerable to Qd3xf5\n- Black's rooks aren't well connected\n- The e5 bishop is a strong piece but could be exchanged\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5g7 - trading the strong bishop but opening the f-file\n2. f5e4 - trading bishops but giving White the bishop pair\n3. d8e7 - connecting rooks and defending e5 bishop\n4. f5g4 - moving the bishop to a safer square while maintaining pressure\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e5g7 seems too committal and gives up the strong bishop\n- f5e4 gives White the bishop pair advantage\n- d8e7 is solid but passive\n- f5g4 is the most flexible, keeping both bishops active while moving the vulnerable f5 bishop to safety\nThe move f5g4:\n- Moves the bishop to a safer square\n- Maintains pressure on e2 and f3 squares\n- Keeps both bishops active\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n- Prepares potential future ...h5-h4 ideas\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf5g4\n```"
