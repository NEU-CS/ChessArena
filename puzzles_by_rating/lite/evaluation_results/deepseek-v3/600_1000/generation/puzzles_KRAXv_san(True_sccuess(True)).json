When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

King safety:\n- White king is exposed on h1 with no pawn cover\n- Black king is relatively safer on g8\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on f1 is attacking white's rook on a1\n- Black's knight on g4 is threatening check on h2\n- White's queen on b4 is attacking black's rook on f8\n4. Possible moves:\nThe only legal move given is Rxf1, which is a queen capture. Let's analyze this:\n- After Rxf1, black can play Nxh2 (forking king and rook)\n- Then after Kxh2, black plays Rxf1, winning the rook\n- White would be down even more material\nHowever, not taking the queen leads to immediate loss of the rook (Qxa1). So Rxf1 is forced, despite the unfavorable consequences.\nThe position is clearly lost for white, but we must make the best practical chance. Taking the queen at least eliminates black's most powerful attacking piece.\n```\nRxf1\n```"
