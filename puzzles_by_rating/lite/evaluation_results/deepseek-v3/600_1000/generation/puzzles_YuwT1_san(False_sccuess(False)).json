When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a rook on b7 and queen on d3, both threatening\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8\n4. White has a passed pawn on d5\n5. Material is roughly equal (Black has Q+N vs White's Q+R)\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c1g5 - attacking the g3 pawn and potentially threatening mate\n2. e1f3 - developing the knight to a more active square\n3. c1f4 - attacking the f2 pawn and king\n4. f6d5 - capturing the passed pawn\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c1g5 looks very strong as it threatens Qxg3+ followed by Qg2+ with mating threats\n- The knight on e1 is already well placed, no need to move it yet\n- f6d5 would give up the strong knight for a pawn, not good\n- c1f4 is less forcing than c1g5\nThe most forcing and dangerous move is c1g5, which creates immediate threats against White's king while keeping all our pieces active. White will have to respond carefully to avoid getting mated.\n```\nc1g5\n```"
