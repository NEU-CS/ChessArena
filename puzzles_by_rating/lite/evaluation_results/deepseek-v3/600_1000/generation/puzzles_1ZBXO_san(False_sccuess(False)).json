When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has bishop, knight, rook and pawns vs Black's 2 rooks and pawns. Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop pair potential).\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on e6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's rooks are active on c5 and d8\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White's pawn structure is solid while Black has some weaknesses\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6g8: Bishop sacrifice to expose Black's king\n- e6f7: Bishop checks the king, forcing it to h6\n- f2f5: Rook lift to attack along the f-file\n- c3d5: Centralizing the knight with tempo on the rook\n4. Deep analysis:\n- e6g8 looks tempting but after ...Kxg8, White doesn't have enough immediate follow-up\n- e6f7+ Kh6 and then White can play f2f5 with strong pressure\n- c3d5 Rc7 and White maintains pressure but less direct\n- f2f5 immediately may allow Black counterplay with ...Rdd5\nThe most forcing and promising line appears to be:\n1. e6f7+ Kh6 (forced)\n2. f2f5! (threatening mate with Rh5#) \nBlack would have to give up material to prevent mate\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne6f7\n```"
