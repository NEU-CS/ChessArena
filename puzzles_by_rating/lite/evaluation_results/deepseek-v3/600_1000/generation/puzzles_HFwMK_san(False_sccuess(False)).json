When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has bishop (b8), king (c8), rook (d8), rook (h8), pawns (b5, g4, h4). Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key observations:\n- White's rooks are very active, especially the one on f7 threatening the back rank\n- Black's king is exposed on c8\n- Black has doubled rooks on the 8th rank defending\n- Black has passed pawns on the kingside (g4, h4)\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7f8: Trade rooks but leaves Black with active rook on h8\n- f7h7: Attacks the h8 rook and threatens mate\n- e4e8: Immediate rook sacrifice to expose the king\n- b3d4: Centralizing the knight with threats\n4. Best move seems to be f7h7 because:\n- It attacks the rook on h8\n- If Black takes (h8h7), then e4e8+ wins the bishop on b8\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with e4e8+ next move\n- It maintains pressure while keeping material balance\nOther moves:\n- f7f8 allows Black to activate their rook\n- e4e8 immediately is premature as Black can defend\n- b3d4 is good but not as forcing as f7h7\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf7h7\n```"
