When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: King, Queen (f2), Rook (a6), 2 pawns (f7, g7)\n- White has: King (h3), Queen (a4), Knight (e7), 2 pawns (a2, b3), passed pawn (e5)\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen is very active on f2, attacking h2 and controlling key squares\n- White's knight on e7 is strong but currently not threatening immediate tactics\n- White's queen on a4 is somewhat passive\n- Black's rook on a6 is well placed to support the a-file\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous if advanced\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's king is on h3, also exposed but currently not under direct attack\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: Moves king to corner, but doesn't improve position\n- g8f8: Moves king towards center, but exposes to potential checks\n- g8h7: Moves king towards h-file, potentially safer\nAfter considering all options, g8h7 seems best because:\n- It moves the king away from potential knight checks (like Ne7g6+)\n- It keeps the king closer to the h-file where it might be safer\n- It doesn't expose the king to any immediate threats\n- It maintains flexibility for future defensive needs\nThe other moves either don't improve the position or potentially expose the king more.\n```\ng8h7\n```"
