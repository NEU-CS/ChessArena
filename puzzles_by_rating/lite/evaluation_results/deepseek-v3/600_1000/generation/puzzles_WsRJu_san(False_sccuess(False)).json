When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has Q+R vs Black's Q+R+B), but White has a passed e-pawn which could be dangerous.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on g8, attacking the black rook on d8\n- Black's queen is on a4, attacking the c4 pawn\n- White's rook on h1 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qxd8+ winning the rook\n- Black's Qa4 is threatening to take c4 pawn\n- Black has potential threats with the bishop on f8\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Qh7 - threatens Qxh8 next move, but allows Qxc4\nb) Qf7 - blocks the bishop, maintains pressure on d8, but still allows Qxc4\nc) Qxd8+ - wins the rook but after Bxd8, Black's bishop becomes active\nd) Rc1 - defends c4 pawn, but seems passive\ne) b3 - defends c4 pawn by preparing to push it away with a3\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qxd8+ is tempting but gives Black active play with the bishop\n- Qh7 allows Qxc4 which is dangerous\n- The best move seems to be b3, defending the c4 pawn while maintaining all our threats. After b3, we still have Qxd8+ as a future option, and our pawn structure remains solid.\nHere's the move:\n```\nb2b3\n```"
