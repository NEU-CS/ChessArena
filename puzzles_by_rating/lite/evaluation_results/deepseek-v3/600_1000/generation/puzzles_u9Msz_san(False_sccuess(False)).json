When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Knight, Bishop, Rook, pawns on a4 and g2\n- Black has: Rook on b8, pawns on b6, g6, h5, e4, King on e5, Rook on g3\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces and better coordination.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on a4 is threatening to capture the b6 pawn\n- Black's rook on g3 is very active and controlling the 3rd rank\n- White's bishop on b3 is pinning the e6 pawn (if it existed) and controlling key diagonals\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on e5\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) b8b7 - defending the b6 pawn\nb) g3g2 - attacking the g2 pawn and threatening to double rooks\nc) e5f6 - king moves forward to support pawns\nd) g3e3 - centralizing the rook\n4. Analysis:\n- b8b7 seems passive and allows White to continue improving position\n- g3g2 looks tempting as it attacks the pawn and threatens to double rooks, but after g3g2, White can play Re2xg2 Rxg2, and Black's rook is active but White has counterplay\n- e5f6 is interesting but might expose the king too much\n- g3e3 is very strong, centralizing the rook and preventing White from doubling rooks. It also maintains pressure on e4 pawn and keeps options open\n5. Best move:\ng3e3 is the most flexible and active move, maintaining Black's active piece play while preventing White from coordinating his rooks. It keeps all options open for future play.\n```\ng3e3\n```"
