If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on g5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White's bishop on b3 is strong, targeting f7\n- Black's queen on g6 is somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Nxh7: Sacrificing the knight to expose Black's king. After Kxh7, Qh6+ Kg8, Bxf7+ Kxf7, Qxh7+ with strong attack\n- Bxf7+: Immediate sacrifice, but after Kxf7, Ng5+ Ke8 and Black can defend\n- Ne6: Forking queen and rook, but Qxg5 is possible\n- Qf4: Centralizing the queen with threats\n4. Best move seems to be Nxh7, the knight sacrifice:\n- After Kxh7, Qh6+ Kg8\n- Then Bxf7+ Kxf7 (if Rxf7, Qxh7+ wins the rook)\n- Qxh7+ Ke8\n- White has strong threats with the queen and rook coming to h1\nThis leads to a very dangerous attack against Black's king while maintaining material equality (knight and bishop for rook and pawn).\n```\nNxh7\n```"
