If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

White has a strong bishop on g5 attacking the pinned f6 pawn\n4. Black's queen is awkwardly placed on b6, not defending key squares\nThe most promising lines appear to be:\n- Qxe8+ wins the rook immediately but allows Kxe8, losing our queen\n- Qxh7+ is tempting but after Kf8, we don't have a clear follow-up\n- Qf7+ is very strong: Kd6 (only move) and then we can play Bxf6 with a discovered attack on the queen\nLet's calculate Qf7+:\n11. Qf7+ Kd6 (forced, as Kd8 allows Qxf8#)\n12. Bxf6 Qxb2 (only way to defend against mate)\n13. Bxg7 and White is up a pawn with a strong attack\nAlternatively, 11. Qf7+ Kd6 12. Bxf6 Qa5+ 13. c3 Qxa2 14. Bxg7 and White is better\nOther moves like Qh6 or Bh6 don't create immediate threats. The most forcing and strongest line is Qf7+.\n```\nQf7+\n```"
