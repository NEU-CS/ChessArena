If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop, pawns\n- Black has queen, 2 rooks, knight, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active on f7\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on f7 is threatening mate on f8 (Qf8#)\n- Black's king is exposed with no immediate shelter\n- Black has some counterplay with the queen and rook battery on the h-file\n- White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White has Qf8# threat that must be addressed\n- Black can deliver some checks but needs to be careful about White's threats\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\na) Rh8 - blocks mate but allows Qxg7 winning material\nb) Rgf8 - blocks mate but leaves rook vulnerable\nc) Qh1+ - check that forces White to respond\nd) Qxg3+ - pawn capture with check\ne) Rg7 - defends f7 square\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qh1+ looks most forcing, as it gives check and forces White to respond\n- After Qh1+ Kf2, we can follow up with Qh2+ maintaining pressure\n- Other moves either allow White to maintain threats or lose material\nThe best move is:\n```\nQh1+\n```"
