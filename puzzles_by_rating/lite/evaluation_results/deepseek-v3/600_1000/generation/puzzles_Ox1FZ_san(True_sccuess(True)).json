When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

King safety:\n- White king is relatively safe on f1, though the f2 pawn is weak.\n- Black king is exposed on g6 with White's knight and queen eyeing it.\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black has a discovered check threat with Rg3+, which would be devastating.\n- Black's queen on h3 is eyeing f1 for potential mate threats.\n4. Move options:\n- hxg3: This captures the rook but allows Qh1# (immediate mate)\n- fxg3: This also captures the rook but allows Qxf1+ (winning the rook)\n5. Evaluation:\n- Both capture options lead to immediate material loss or mate.\n- The position is actually lost for White because any move allows Black to deliver mate or win material decisively.\nSince both legal moves lead to immediate loss, but we must make a move, we should choose the one that prolongs the game slightly longer:\n```\nfxg3\n```\nThis at least prevents immediate mate (unlike hxg3), though Black will still win the rook with Qxf1+. The position is hopeless, but this is the only possible move."
