Our knight on f5 is very active and has several promising options\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawn weaknesses around it\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- Nxh6+: This sacrifices the knight but opens up Black's king position. After gxh6, we have Qxh6 with threats against the king. However, Black can defend with Rf7.\n- Ne7+: Forking king and queen. Black would likely play Kh8, and after Nxc6 we have a messy position.\n- Qh4: Directly targeting the h6 pawn and putting pressure on Black's kingside. This maintains our strong knight on f5.\n- Ng7: A quiet move, eyeing e6 square and maintaining pressure.\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Nxh6+ is tempting but may not lead to a decisive advantage after gxh6 Qxh6 Rf7.\n- Ne7+ is interesting but gives Black time to reorganize.\n- Qh4 seems most promising, increasing pressure on the kingside while keeping all options open. It threatens Qxh6 next move if Black doesn't defend properly, and maintains our strong knight on f5.\nHere's the move:\n```\nQh4\n```"
