When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has Q+N+2P (queen, knight, 2 pawns)\n- Black has Q+R+P (queen, rook, pawn)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on a4\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's queen is attacking h2 pawn\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Kh8: Gets the king off the g-file but doesn't improve position\n- Kf8: Moves toward center but exposes to potential checks\n- Kh7: Gets the king off the back rank but may be more exposed\n4. Threats:\n- White has Qa4-f4+ ideas\n- White's knight is well placed on e7\n- Need to protect against potential mating threats\n5. Best choice:\nKh7 seems most flexible as it:\n- Gets the king off the back rank\n- Prepares to potentially bring the king toward the center later\n- Doesn't immediately expose to checks\n- Keeps options open for the queen to defend\nThe other moves either don't improve the position (Kh8) or expose the king more (Kf8).\n```\nKh7\n```"
