When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- Black has a knight on h3 attacking g1 and f2\n- White has a strong bishop on b3 eyeing f7\n- Black's queen on d7 is somewhat tied to defending e6 bishop\n- White's queen on c2 is well placed for potential attacks\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxg6+: Forcing but after Kxg6 Nf5+ wins the queen back, but unclear if better\n- Bxd5: Opens up the position, but after cxd5 Qxd5+ Qxd5 Rxd5 position is equal\n- Ne4: Centralizes knight, threatens Nf6+ and defends against Nxf2\n- Nh5+: Checks king, but after Kg8 doesn't lead to anything concrete\n- gxh3: Removes the annoying knight but opens g-file\n4. Best move seems to be Ne4:\n- Centralizes the knight powerfully\n- Threatens Nf6+ winning the queen\n- Defends against Nxf2 tricks\n- Maintains all of White's positional advantages\n- Keeps options open for future attacks\nOther moves either don't achieve as much or lead to unclear complications. Ne4 is solid and improves White's position.\n```\nNe4\n```"
