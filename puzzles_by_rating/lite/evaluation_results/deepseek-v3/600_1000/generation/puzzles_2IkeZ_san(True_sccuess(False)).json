When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a bishop on c4 attacking f7, and a queen on f3 also eyeing f7\n3. White's pawn on e4 controls d5 and f5\n4. Black's king is still in the starting position with castling rights\nKey observations:\n- f7 is a critical weak point that White is targeting\n- Black needs to develop pieces while securing the position\n- Premature pawn moves could weaken the position\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Nf6 - Develops the knight and defends against potential threats to f7\n2. Bg7 - Develops the bishop and prepares to castle\n3. d6 - Solidifies the center but blocks the bishop\n4. Nc6 - Develops the knight but doesn't address the f7 weakness\nBest options:\n- Nf6 is most principled as it develops a piece and defends f7\n- Bg7 is also good but leaves f7 vulnerable for one more move\n- Other moves either don't develop pieces or create weaknesses\nAfter considering all options, Nf6 is the most solid move as it:\n- Develops a piece\n- Defends the vulnerable f7 square\n- Maintains flexibility for future development\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nNf6\n```"
