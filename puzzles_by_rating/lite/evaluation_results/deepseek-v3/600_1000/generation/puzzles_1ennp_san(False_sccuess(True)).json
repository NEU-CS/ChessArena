Key features:\n- Black's rook is very active on b4, attacking White's d4 pawn\n- White's rook is on c1, which could become active\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g7\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n- Both sides have passed pawns (White's d4, Black's c6)\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c1c4: Challenges the rook immediately, but after b4xc4 dxc4, Black's c-pawn is dangerous\n- c1c5: Puts pressure on c6 pawn, but allows Black to play b4xd4\n- h1g1: Improves king safety\n- d4d5: Advances the passed pawn but leaves it weak\n- f3f4: Creates luft for the king but weakens e4\n4. Best plan:\n- Need to activate the rook while maintaining some pressure\n- c1c6 seems interesting as it pins the c6 pawn to the king\n- After c1c6, if Black takes b4xd4, then c6xc6 and White has counterplay\n- If Black doesn't take, White can consider doubling rooks or activating the king\n5. Calculating c1c6:\n- If c1c6 b4xd4, then c6xc6 d4d3 (threatening to queen), but White has c6c7+ and can create counterplay\n- If c1c6 and Black doesn't take, White can bring king to g1 next move\nThis seems like the most active and challenging move for Black to handle.\n```\nc1c6\n```"

Material count:\n- White has a Rook (c6) and 4 pawns (d4, f3, g2, h2)\n- Black has a Rook (b1) and 4 pawns (g7, g6, h5, f7)\n- Kings are at h1 (White) and g7 (Black)\n2. Positional factors:\n- White's Rook is very active on the 6th rank\n- Black's Rook is pinning White's g2 pawn to the King\n- Black's King is more active and centralized\n- White's pawn structure is solid but somewhat passive\n- Black has connected passed pawns on the kingside\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black threatens to play ...Rb2 attacking the f2 pawn\n- Black could also push ...h4-h3 to create more pressure\n- White needs to maintain the pin on the g6 pawn\n4. Available move:\nOnly c6c1 is legal (other pieces are blocked or would leave the king in check)\n5. Evaluation of c6c1:\n- Moves the Rook to the first rank\n- Maintains the pin on the g6 pawn (now from the side)\n- Protects against ...Rb2 by controlling the b1 square\n- Prepares potential Rook swings to other files\n- Keeps the Rook active while maintaining defensive duties\nThis seems like the best practical chance, as it maintains control while preventing Black's immediate threats. The position appears roughly balanced, but White must play precisely to hold the draw.\n```\nc6c1\n```"
