When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed on g8.\n3. Black has threats with the queen on h3 and bishop on b7.\n4. White's pawn on f6 is passed and dangerous.\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5h6 - attacking the pawn and threatening mate\n2. f1f5 - centralizing the rook and defending against Qh1#\n3. c3d5 - developing the knight with tempo on the bishop\n4. a7a8 - promoting the pawn immediately\nLet's evaluate these:\n1. g5h6:\n- Threatens Qh7# next move\n- Black can defend with Qxh6, but then Rxf7 is strong\n- However, after Qxh6 Rxf7, Black has Qh1+ forcing a perpetual\n2. f1f5:\n- Defends against Qh1#\n- But doesn't create immediate threats\n- Black can consolidate with moves like Re7\n3. c3d5:\n- Attacks the bishop on b7\n- If Bxd5, Qxd5+ with discovered attack on the rook\n- But Black can play Qh1+ first, forcing Kh1 Qxd5\n4. a7a8:\n- Promotes to queen immediately\n- After Qxa8, Qh7+ Kf8 Qh8+ Ke7 Qxg7+ wins material\n- This seems most forcing and decisive\nAfter careful consideration, promoting the pawn is the most decisive move, leading to a forced win of material and likely checkmate soon. The other options either allow counterplay or don't maximize our advantage.\n```\na7a8\n```"
