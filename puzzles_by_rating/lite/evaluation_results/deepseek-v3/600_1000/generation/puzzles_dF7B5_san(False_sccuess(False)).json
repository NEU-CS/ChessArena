When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook at g8 and a pawn at g6 (connected to h6)\n3. White has rooks at c2 and c7, which are doubling on the c-file\n4. Black has a passed a-pawn at a7 and White has a passed b-pawn at b4\n5. Material is equal (rook vs rook), but White's rooks are more active\nThreats:\n- White's rook at c7 is very active and could potentially threaten Black's king\n- White could play Rc7-c6+ to check the king\n- White's b-pawn is passed and could advance\nBlack's options:\n1. Rook moves: g8h8/f8/e8/d8/c8/b8/a8/g7 - most passive, except g8c8 could challenge White's rook\n2. g6 pawn moves: g6g7/f6/e6/d6/c6/g5/g4/g3/g2 - advancing could be risky\n3. King moves: b6a6 - moving away from potential checks\n4. a7 pawn moves: a7a6/a5 - advancing the passed pawn\nBest candidate moves:\n1. g8c8 - challenges White's rook and reduces their activity\n2. a7a5 - advances the passed pawn, but White can respond with b4xa5\n3. b6a6 - moves king away from potential checks\nAfter considering, g8c8 seems strongest as it directly challenges White's active rook and reduces their control. The other options either don't address White's activity or create weaknesses.\n```\ng8c8\n```"
