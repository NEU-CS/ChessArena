Material count:\n- White has: Rook (a1), Rook (f4), Knight (f3), Bishop (h6), pawns (a3, b4, d4, e5, f2, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (a8), Rook (f8), Bishop (b6), Knight (c6), pawns (a7, b7, f5, g6, g7)\n2. Immediate threats:\n- White's Bishop on h6 is attacking Black's King\n- White has a strong pawn structure and active pieces\n3. King safety:\n- Black's King is exposed on g7\n- White's Bishop on h6 is a major threat\n4. Available moves:\n- Kh8: Gets the king out of immediate danger but leaves the rook on f8 hanging to the knight on f6\n- Kxh6: Captures the bishop but leaves the king very exposed\nLet's evaluate both options:\na) Kh8:\n- Gets the king to relative safety\n- But after 22. Nxg6+! fxg6 23. Rxg6, White has a strong attack with threats like Qg5+ coming\nb) Kxh6:\n- Removes the dangerous bishop\n- After 22. Nxg6 fxg6 23. Rxg6+ Kh7, White can play 24. Rg7+ Kh8 25. Rxb7 with material advantage\n- However, this might be the lesser evil as it removes the immediate mating threats\nAfter careful consideration, Kxh6 seems slightly better as it eliminates the dangerous bishop immediately, though the position remains difficult. The king will be exposed but at least the most dangerous attacking piece is gone.\n```\nKxh6\n```"
