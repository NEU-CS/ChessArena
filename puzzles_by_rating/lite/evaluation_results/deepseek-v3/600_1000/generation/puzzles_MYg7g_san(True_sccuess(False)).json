If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has Q+B+N vs Black's Q+B+N. Material is equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n2. King safety: White's king is slightly exposed on c1, but not in immediate danger. Black's king is on a7, which is somewhat vulnerable.\n3. Piece activity:\n   - White's queen on f4 is very active, attacking e5 and with potential to attack the black king\n   - White's bishop on d3 is strong, eyeing the a6 pawn and the black king's diagonal\n   - Black's queen on g7 is defending e5 but could become exposed\n   - Black's knight on e5 is a strong outpost but potentially vulnerable\n4. Key observations:\n   - Black's e5 knight is defended by queen and pawn, but we can potentially overload the queen's defenses\n   - The black king is vulnerable on the a7-g1 diagonal\n   - The a6 pawn is weak and could be a target\n5. Candidate moves:\n   - Qxe5: Wins a pawn but after dxe5 Bxe5, Black has Qxe5 and we lose material\n   - Qf7: Attacks the queen and threatens mate on a7, but Qxf7 Bxf7 leaves us with no advantage\n   - Bxa6: Wins a pawn but bxa6 Qxa6+ Kb8 and we don't have enough compensation\n   - Qh6: Threatens Qxg7+ winning the queen, but Black can play Qxh6\n   - Qf6: Pins the e5 knight to the queen, creating multiple threats\nAfter careful consideration, Qf6 is the strongest move:\n- It pins the knight to the queen\n- Threatens Qxe5 winning the knight (if queen moves, Qxa6+ is mate)\n- Maintains all our active piece play\n- Black has no good way to defend both the knight and the a6 pawn\nBlack's best response would likely be Qxf6, but then exf6 and we win a pawn with a better endgame structure.\n```\nQf6\n```"
