If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Material count:\n- White has: Knight, Bishop, King and 1 pawn\n- Black has: Rook, King and 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (rook vs knight+bishop), but black has more pawns.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight is very active on e5, attacking f7 and g6\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White's bishop controls important squares\n- Black's rook is active on the 2nd rank\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats with the knight and bishop coordination\n- Black needs to be careful about king safety and potential forks\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Kxe5: Taking the knight leads to Bxe5+ winning the exchange, but black's position remains difficult\n- Ke7: Gets the king to safety but allows white to consolidate\n- Rf3+: Checks the king but after Kd4, black's rook is exposed\n- Re2+: Another check that forces the king to move\n- h5: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address immediate concerns\n5. Best move:\nRe2+ is the most forcing move. It checks the white king and forces it to move, after which black can reposition the rook or king. The line would be:\n1... Re2+ 2. Kd4 (if Kc3 then Rf2 with threats) and now black can play 2... Rf2 keeping the rook active and eyeing the f-pawn.\nThis maintains black's activity and keeps pressure on white's position.\n```\nRe2+\n```"
