If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, pawns)\n2. White has a strong bishop on b3 targeting f7\n3. White's rook is actively placed on e5, but it's undefended\n4. Black's queen is on f6, which is a good central square\n5. Black's dark-squared bishop is still on f8, not yet developed\nKey observations:\n- White's rook on e5 is a tactical vulnerability since it's undefended\n- The f7 pawn is weak due to pressure from White's bishop\n- Black can consider trading queens to relieve pressure\n- Black needs to activate the rook on a8\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qxe5 - wins the rook but after dxe5 Bxe6, Black's position becomes passive\n2. Qe6 - defends f7 and maintains central control\n3. Rfe8 - develops the rook and pins the e5 rook\n4. Bg4 - develops the bishop with tempo by attacking the queen\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qxe5 is tempting but leads to a passive position\n- Rfe8 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Bg4 is interesting but White can simply move the queen\n- Qe6 is the most flexible, defending f7 while keeping options open\nThe best move is:\n```\nQe6\n```"
