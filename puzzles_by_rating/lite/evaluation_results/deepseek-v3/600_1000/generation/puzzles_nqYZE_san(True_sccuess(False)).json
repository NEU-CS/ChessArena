If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black has doubled rooks on the e-file which is a potential strength.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8, while White's king is better protected. White has threats against the black king.\n3. Key observations:\n- White's queen on d4 is very active and threatening to take on f6 (Qxf6)\n- Black's bishop on f5 is pinned to the queen\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's rooks are doubled on the e-file but not immediately productive\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxd4: Capturing the queen but leads to Bxd4 with a worse position due to White's active pieces\n- Rxf2: Sacrificing the exchange to eliminate White's strong knight\n- Qe6: Protecting f6 and centralizing the queen\n- Kh8: Moving the king away from potential checks\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qxd4 is bad due to the resulting position\n- Rxf2 is interesting but after Kxf2 Qxd4 Bxd4, Black's position remains difficult\n- Qe6 seems most prudent, protecting f6 and maintaining the queen's activity\n- Kh8 is too passive\nThe best move is to protect f6 and keep the queen active while maintaining material equality. \n```\nQe6\n```"
