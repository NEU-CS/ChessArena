When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, rook, knight, queen vs White's rook, knight, bishop, queen). \n2. King safety: Black's king is still on g8, not castled, but not immediately threatened. White's king is on g1, castled.\n3. Key features:\n   - Black's queen on g5 is very active\n   - White has a passed pawn on b5\n   - White's queen on d4 is centralized but potentially exposed\n   - Black has a knight on f5 that could become very strong\n4. Threats:\n   - White may want to play Qxf5 at some point\n   - White could push the b-pawn further\n   - Black needs to activate the rooks\nAfter considering several candidate moves:\n- g5d8 (queen to d8): Would connect rooks but seems passive\n- f5e3: Could be interesting to attack the bishop on d3\n- g5h4: Keeps queen active and eyes h2\n- a8d8: Activates the rook to a central file\nThe best move appears to be f5e3, attacking the bishop on d3 and potentially opening up lines against White's king. After 1...Ne3, if White takes 2.fxe3, Black can play 2...Qh4 with strong threats against h2. If White doesn't take, Black can consider moves like ...Nxd3 or ...Nf5 next move.\n```\nf5e3\n```"
