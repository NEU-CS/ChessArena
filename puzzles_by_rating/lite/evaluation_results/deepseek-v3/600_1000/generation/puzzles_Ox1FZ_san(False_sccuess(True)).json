When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Queen, Knight, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Bishop, Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with knight vs bishop)\n2. King safety:\n- White king is somewhat exposed on f1\n- Black king is exposed on g6 but has pawn cover\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black has a very dangerous discovered attack with the rook on g3 (threatening Qxh2#)\n- The black queen on h3 is also eyeing h2\n4. Available moves:\n- h2g3: blocks the discovered attack but allows Qxh2#\n- f2g3: also blocks but allows Qxh2#\nThis appears to be a forced mate in 1 for Black after any White move. Both legal moves allow Qxh2#. The position is actually already lost for White due to the unstoppable mate threat.\nHowever, since I must make a move, I'll choose the one that at least removes the rook from g3, though it doesn't change the outcome:\n```\nf2g3\n```"
