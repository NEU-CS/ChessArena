When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has queen, bishop, pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, knight, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has active pieces\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on a6, eyeing the c8 rook\n- White's bishop on d5 is strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed in the center with limited pawn cover\n- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Qxc8+ or Qxb6\n- Black's king safety is a major concern\n4. The only legal move is Kb8:\n- Gets the king away from the open file\n- Prevents immediate Qxc8+\n- But leaves the b6 pawn undefended\nGiven that Kb8 is the only legal move, and it's necessary to protect the king from immediate threats, we must play it. While it loses the b6 pawn, it's better than getting mated or losing more material.\n```\nKb8\n```"
