When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- Black's rook is very active on c4, attacking the c3 pawn\n- White's rook is on a7, not very active\n- Black's bishop is on f6, controlling important diagonals\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g8\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxc3: Wins a pawn but allows White counterplay with Ra8+\n- Rh4+: Checks the king and forces it to g1, then we can consider Rg4+\n- Be5: Centralizes the bishop and threatens to win the c3 pawn\n- Rc5: Improves rook position and maintains pressure\n4. Best move analysis:\n- Rxc3 seems tempting but after 1...Rxc3 2.Ra8+ Kf7 3.Ra7+ White gets some counterplay\n- Rh4+ is interesting: 1...Rh4+ 2.Kg1 Rg4+ 3.Kh1 and we haven't gained much\n- Be5 is strong as it threatens both Rxc3 and potential mating ideas with Rh4+ later\nThe most promising move is Be5, which:\n- Centralizes the bishop\n- Maintains all threats\n- Prepares potential discovered checks\n- Doesn't allow White any counterplay\n```\nBe5\n```"
