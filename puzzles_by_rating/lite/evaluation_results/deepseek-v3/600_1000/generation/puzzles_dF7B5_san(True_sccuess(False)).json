When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is equal, but White has more active rooks (both on the 7th and c-files).\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on b6, while White's king is relatively safer on g1.\n3. Pawn structure: Black has pawns on a7, b5, e5, h6; White has pawns on a3, b4, e4, g2. Black's pawns are more advanced but potentially vulnerable.\n4. Key observations:\n- White's rooks are doubled on the 7th rank, putting pressure on Black's position\n- Black's rooks are somewhat uncoordinated\n- The h6 pawn is potentially weak\n- White's g2 pawn is a target\n5. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxg2+: This seems tempting as it wins a pawn, but after Kxg2, White's king becomes active and Black's position remains vulnerable\n- R8g7: This defends the g7 square and coordinates the rooks\n- Ka6: Moves the king away from potential checks\n- h5: Advances the h-pawn to create counterplay\nAfter careful consideration, R8g7 seems the most solid move:\n- It connects the rooks\n- Defends the g7 square against potential rook incursions\n- Maintains flexibility for future plans\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\nThe other moves either give up material (Rxg2+) or don't improve the position sufficiently.\n```\nR8g7\n```"
