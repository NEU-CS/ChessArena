When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.\nThe current position is:\n- White king on d5, pawns on d3 and g3\n- Black king on f5, pawn on g4 (passed pawn)\n- White to move\nKey observations:\n1. Black has a passed pawn on g4 that is very dangerous and close to promotion.\n2. White has two connected pawns (d3 and g3) but they are currently blocked.\n3. The black king is actively placed near the pawns.\nLet's evaluate each legal move:\n1. d5d6 (Kd6):\n   - Moves king forward but away from the g-pawn\n   - Black can push g4-g3, then after Kd5 g2, White can't stop promotion\n   - Seems dangerous as it abandons the g-pawn\n2. d5c6 (Kc6):\n   - Similar to Kd6 but even further from the g-pawn\n   - Black can push g4-g3 immediately with similar problems\n   - Not good\n3. d5c5 (Kc5):\n   - Keeps the king centralized but still allows g4-g3\n   - After g3, Kd4 g2, Ke3 and White might stop the pawn\n   - But Black can play Kf4 first, complicating matters\n   - Risky\n4. d5c4 (Kc4):\n   - Gets closer to the g-pawn but leaves the d-pawn undefended\n   - Black can take d3 with Kf4, winning the pawn\n   - Not good\n5. d3d4 (d4):\n   - Pushes the pawn, blocking the black king's path\n   - After Kf4, Kd5 maintains control\n   - Creates counterplay with White's own passed pawn\n   - Best chance to create threats while containing Black's pawn\nThe best move is d3d4, as it:\n- Creates immediate counterplay with the d-pawn\n- Restricts the black king's movement\n- Maintains some control over the g-pawn's advance\n- Gives White the best practical chances to hold the position\nAfter d4, if Black plays Kf4, White can respond with Kd5, keeping both pawns under observation. The position remains complex but this gives White the best fighting chances.\n```\nd3d4\n```"
