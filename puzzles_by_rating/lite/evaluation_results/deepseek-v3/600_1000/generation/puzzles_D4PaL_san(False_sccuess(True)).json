When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a very active queen on h5, eyeing the f7 pawn and potentially threatening mate on h7\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced on the kingside\n4. White has castled kingside while Black's king is still in the center\n5. White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Qxh7# if Black doesn't defend\n- Black's queen is currently overloaded - it needs to defend both h7 and d8 (against potential rook penetration)\n- The f7 pawn is weak and under attack by White's queen\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g7g6 - blocks the queen's path to h7 but weakens the dark squares\n2. f6h6 - trades queens but leaves Black with a weak king position\n3. f6f5 - blocks the queen's attack on f7 but allows Qxh7#\n4. f6g6 - defends h7 but leaves f7 weak\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g7g6 seems forced to prevent mate on h7\n- After g7g6, White can play Qf3 or Qg4 maintaining pressure\n- Other moves either allow mate or lose material\nThe best move is to block the queen's path to h7 while maintaining some control over the position.\n```\ng7g6\n```"
