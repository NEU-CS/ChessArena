If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Black has a strong bishop pair with the dark-squared bishop on g4 and light-squared on f6\n3. White has some weaknesses:\n   - The pawn on d3 is isolated and potentially weak\n   - The knight on f3 is pinned to the queen by the bishop on g4\n   - The h3 pawn is potentially vulnerable\nKey observations:\n- The immediate Qh2+ looks tempting but after Kg1, Black doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- The bishop on g4 is doing important work pinning the knight\n- The bishop on f6 is somewhat passive and could be repositioned\n- The c5 pawn is a potential target for White's pieces\nBest candidate moves:\n1. Bxf3 - Removing the defender of White's center, but gives up the bishop pair\n2. Be5 - Centralizing the bishop and increasing pressure\n3. Qd6 - Putting pressure on d4 and connecting rooks\n4. Rfe8 - Developing the rook to an open file\nAfter careful consideration, Be5 seems strongest because:\n- It centralizes the bishop powerfully\n- It maintains the pin on the knight\n- It eyes the weak d4 square\n- It prevents White from playing d4 himself\n- It keeps all options open for future moves\nThe move also prepares potential rook lifts via Re8-e6 or doubling on the e-file.\n```\nBe5\n```"
