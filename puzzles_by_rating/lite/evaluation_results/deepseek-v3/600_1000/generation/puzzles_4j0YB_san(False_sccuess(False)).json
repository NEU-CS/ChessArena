When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns)\n2. White has a space advantage with pawns on c5 and d4 controlling central squares\n3. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n4. Black has some pressure on the long diagonal (a8-h1) with the bishop on e7 and queen on c7\n5. White's pieces are well coordinated - queen on b3, knight on c3, bishop on e2\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b3b7 - This looks tempting as it attacks the queen and threatens to win material. However, after Qxb7 Nxb7, Black gets two pieces for the queen and the position becomes unclear.\n2. c3d5 - Centralizing the knight and attacking the pawn on e6. Black can defend with ...exd5 cxd5 when White gets a passed pawn but Black's pieces become active.\n3. e2h5 - Developing the bishop aggressively, threatening to pin the f6 knight if Black plays ...g6. But this seems premature.\n4. a2a4 - Preparing to expand on the queenside, but not the most active.\nAfter careful consideration, b3b7 seems the most forcing and promising move. Even though it leads to queen exchange, White gains material advantage (queen vs two pieces) and can follow up with active play. The passed pawn on c5 and better king position give White good winning chances.\n```\nb3b7\n```"
