When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White's knight on d5 is very strong, controlling important squares\n- Black's rook on e8 is active\n- Black's knight on d3 is threatening but can be captured by the rook\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Kf3: Gets closer to the center but exposes king to checks\n- Kg2: Moves king toward safety but still leaves some vulnerability\n- Kg1: Safest square, but may be too passive\n- Kf1: Similar to Kg1 but slightly less safe due to potential rook checks\n4. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is ...Re2+ if we don't defend properly\n- After any king move, Black can play ...Nxb3 or ...Nf4+\nAfter careful consideration, Kg1 seems best because:\n- It gets the king to maximum safety\n- Prepares to possibly play Rxd3 next move if Black doesn't defend\n- Avoids any immediate checks or threats\n- Keeps options open for future play\nThe other moves either expose the king too much or don't improve the position as effectively.\n```\nKg1\n```"
