When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has Q, B, R, 3 pawns\n- Black has Q, R, R, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen is very active on c7\n- Black has doubled rooks on the f-file\n- White's bishop controls important diagonals\n3. Threats:\n- Black has Qf2+ threat after ...Rxf1+\n- White has potential mating threats with Qg7#\n4. Candidate moves:\na) Qg7+ - forces Qxg7 but leads to Bxg7+ winning the queen\nb) Qf7 - attacking the queen, but Black can play Qxf7\nc) Qd8 - threatening mate, but Black has Qf8\nd) Bg8 - threatening mate, but Black can play Rxg8\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qg7+ is the most forcing move:\n  1. Qg7+ Qxg7\n  2. Bxg7+ Kxg7\n  3. Rxf2 and White is up a rook for bishop\nLet me verify if there are any better alternatives:\n- Qf7 Qxf7 Rxf7 looks equal\n- Qd8 Qf8 and Black defends\n- Bg8 Rxg8 Qxg7+ Qxg7 Bxg7 Kxg7 is similar to main line but less forcing\nThe most precise is Qg7+ leading to a winning endgame.\n```\nc7g7\n```"
