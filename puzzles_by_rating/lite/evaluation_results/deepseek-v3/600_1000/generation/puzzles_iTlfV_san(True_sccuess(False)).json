However, White has more active pieces and better coordination.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on c4 eyeing the black kingside\n- White's rook on h5 is very active\n- Black's knight on h7 is awkwardly placed\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawn weaknesses around it\n- White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxh7: Immediate sacrifice to open the king\n- Bxf7+: Bishop sacrifice to expose the king\n- Qxe5: Winning a pawn but allowing counterplay\n- Rh6: Increasing pressure on g6\n- Rg5: Preparing to double on the h-file\n4. Deep analysis:\n- Rxh7 Kxh7 2. Qh3+ Kg8 3. Bxf7+ Kxf7 4. Qh7+ Ke8 5. Qxg6+ Kd7 6. Qf7+ leads to perpetual check at best\n- Bxf7+ Kxf7 2. Qxe5 looks promising but after Qxe5 3. Rxe5 Rf8 Black can defend\n- Rh6 looks interesting, threatening Qh3 ideas, but Black can defend with ...Qf6\n- Rg5 is very strong, preparing to double rooks on the h-file with Rdh1 next, and Black has no good defense against this plan\nAfter careful consideration, Rg5 is the most promising move, maintaining all threats while improving the rook's position and preparing to double on the h-file. Black has no good way to prevent the coming attack.\n```\nRg5\n```"
