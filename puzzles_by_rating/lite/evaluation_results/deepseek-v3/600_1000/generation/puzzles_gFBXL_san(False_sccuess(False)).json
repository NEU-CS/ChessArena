When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, knight vs Black's queen, 2 rooks, bishop. Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has pressure on the g-file with queen and pawn\n- White's queen on b4 is eyeing the weak f8 square\n- Black has a bishop on a2 pinning White's pawn on c2\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5g7: Knight fork attacking rook and queen\n- b4b7: Queen attacking the rook and threatening back rank mate ideas\n- f3b7: Bishop sacrifice to expose the king\n- a1g7: Bishop sacrifice to open the king\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- h5g7 looks very strong: after h5g7, if ...rxg7 then b4f8+ wins the rook back with a strong attack. If ...qxg7 then b4b7 wins the rook on e7.\n- b4b7 is also good but allows Black more defensive resources like ...qg6\n- f3b7 is tempting but after ...rxb7, b4xb7 qxb7, we lose the initiative\n- a1g7 is interesting but not as forcing as h5g7\nThe knight sacrifice h5g7 is the most forcing and leads to immediate material gain or a winning attack. Black has no good way to avoid losing material.\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh5g7\n```"
