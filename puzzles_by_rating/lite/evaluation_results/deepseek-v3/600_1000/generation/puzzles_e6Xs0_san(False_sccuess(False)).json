When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White: Rook, 3 pawns\n- Black: Queen, Rook, 3 pawns\nBlack is up a queen vs rook, but White has some counterplay with passed pawns.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed a-pawn that's advanced to a5\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- Black's queen is on e1, controlling the e-file\n- Black has a rook on c2, which is dangerous\n- White's rook on e4 is very active\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens Rc2xh2#\n- Black also has potential mating threats with Qe1xh4#\n- White needs to defend against these while pushing his own threats\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4e8: Rook to the 8th rank, threatening to promote the a-pawn\n- e4e7: Similar idea, but less direct\n- e4h4: Defends h2 against Qxh4# while attacking h5 pawn\n- g3g4: Pushes the pawn to create luft for the king\n5. Analysis:\n- e4e8 looks very strong as it threatens Re8+ followed by a6-a7-a8Q\n- After Re8+, Black's king must move (Kf6 or Kh6)\n- If Kf6, then a6 and Black can't stop the pawn\n- If Kh6, then Rxh8 and White's pawns become dangerous\n- Other moves either don't create enough threats or leave White vulnerable to mate\n6. Conclusion:\ne4e8 is the most forcing move that creates immediate threats while also defending against Black's mating threats by controlling the e-file.\n```\ne4e8\n```"
