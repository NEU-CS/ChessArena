When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, queen, bishop, knight vs White's rook, queen, knight, bishop). The pawn structure is balanced.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed on f7 (very unusual for a king to be on f7)\n- Black has a strong knight on f5 attacking h4 pawn\n- White has pressure on the d-file with queen on d3\n- Black's rooks are not optimally placed (a8 and h8)\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to play Qxd5, winning a pawn\n- White could also consider moves like Rdg1 to double rooks on the g-file\n4. Candidate moves:\na) f5g7 - attacking the exposed king and forking queen and rook\nb) d8e7 - defending the d5 pawn and connecting rooks\nc) f5h4 - winning the h4 pawn but allowing White counterplay\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f5g7 looks very strong as it attacks the king and creates multiple threats\n- After f5g7, if Kxg7 then Qf6+ wins the bishop on d6\n- If White doesn't take the knight, Black can follow up with Qf6 or Rg8 with strong attack\nThe best move is clearly:\n```\nf5g7\n```"
