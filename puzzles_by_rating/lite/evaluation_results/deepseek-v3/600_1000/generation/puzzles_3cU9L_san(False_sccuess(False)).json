When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has connected passed pawns on d6 and e6, which are very dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White's knight on f7 is very active, controlling key squares\n- Black's rook on g4 is active but could be more effective\n- Black's knight on e4 is well placed but needs to be careful about White's pawns\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to push e6-e7, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- White could also try to advance d6-d7\n- Black needs to contain these pawns while improving his own position\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8f8: Gets the king to safety but doesn't address the pawns\n- g4g5: Attacks the f5 pawn but may not be most urgent\n- e4f6: Attacks the knight and blocks the d-pawn\n- e4d6: Blocks the d-pawn directly\n- g6g5: Creates a passed pawn but may be too slow\n5. Best move analysis:\n- e4d6 seems most logical, directly blocking the dangerous d-pawn\n- After e4d6, if White plays e6e7, we can respond with d6f7, forking king and knight\n- This maintains our material advantage while containing White's pawns\nOther options:\n- e4f6 allows d6-d7 which is dangerous\n- King moves don't address the pawns\n- Rook moves don't deal with the immediate threat\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne4d6\n```"
