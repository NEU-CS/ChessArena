When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Rook, Bishop, Knight and pawns each). Black has doubled rooks on the e-file which is interesting.\n2. King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8, while White's king is safer on g1.\n3. Piece activity:\n   - Black's rook on e5 is very active\n   - White's knight on d6 is well placed\n   - White has connected rooks on the f and c files\n4. Threats:\n   - White has potential threats like Rf2-f7 or Rc1-c7\n   - Black needs to maintain activity while being careful about back rank issues\n5. Candidate moves:\n   - e5e8: Doubling rooks on the e-file, but blocks the bishop\n   - e5e7: More active, threatens to go to e2 or support f7-f5 push\n   - b5e8: Bishop move, but seems passive\n   - f7f5: Pawn break, but might weaken e6\n   - h7h5: Pawn push, but not immediately relevant\nAfter considering these options, e5e7 seems the most promising:\n- It maintains rook activity\n- Prepares potential rook lifts to e2 or e1\n- Keeps pressure on White's position\n- Doesn't block the bishop's diagonal\n- Guards against potential Rf2-f7 ideas\nThe move e5e7 also prevents White from playing Rf2-f7 in some lines, as the rook would then be hanging to our rook on e7.\nOther moves either lose activity (like e5e8) or don't improve our position enough. The pawn moves can be considered later if needed, but first we should maximize our piece activity.\n```\ne5e7\n```"
