When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns).\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong centralized queen on e4\n- Black's queen is very active on c5\n- White has a knight on b5 attacking c7\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n- White has pressure along the b-file and d-file\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Nxc7 winning the exchange\n- White also has potential threats like Qxc5 or Bxc5 in some lines\n- Black needs to address the immediate threat to c7 while maintaining counterplay\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5d6 - blocks the b5 knight's attack on c7 while maintaining queen activity\n- e7d8 - develops the bishop and defends c7\n- c6d4 - counterattacking central square\n- c5b6 - moving the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n5. Evaluating c5d6:\n- Immediately stops Nxc7 threat\n- Keeps queen active and centralized\n- May allow White to play Qxd6, but after ...exd6, Black has compensation with two bishops and open position\n- However, White could also play other moves maintaining pressure\n6. Evaluating e7d8:\n- Solid defensive move\n- But somewhat passive and allows White to maintain initiative\n- After Nxc7 Bxc7, White has Qxc7 with some advantage\n7. Evaluating c6d4:\n- Active move challenging White's center\n- But after Nxd4 Qxd4, White can play Bf4 with strong pressure\n- Also doesn't fully address the c7 threat\n8. Evaluating c5b6:\n- Gets queen out of danger\n- But gives up central control\n- Allows White to play Nxc7 with advantage\nAfter careful consideration, c5d6 seems the most principled move:\n- It immediately addresses the main threat\n- Maintains active piece play\n- Leads to dynamic complications where Black has counterplay\n```\nc5d6\n```"
