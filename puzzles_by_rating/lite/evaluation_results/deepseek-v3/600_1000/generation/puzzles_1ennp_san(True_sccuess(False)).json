When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a rook and 3 pawns vs Black's rook and 4 pawns. Black is up one pawn, but White's pawn structure is better.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed d-pawn that's already on d4\n- Black's rook is actively placed on b4, attacking the d4 pawn\n- Black's king is relatively active on g7\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxc6: Capturing the pawn but giving up the d-pawn after Rxd4\n- Rc5: Protecting the d-pawn while activating the rook\n- Kg1: Getting the king to safer squares\n- d5: Advancing the passed pawn\n4. Evaluation:\n- Rxc6 seems tempting but after Rxd4, Black's rook becomes too active\n- Kg1 is safe but doesn't make progress\n- d5 is interesting but after cxd5, White's pawn structure weakens\n- Rc5 is the most flexible, protecting d4 while keeping options open\n5. Best move: Rc5\n- Protects the d4 pawn\n- Prepares to activate the rook (could go to a5 or e5 next)\n- Maintains control of the c-file\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\nThe other moves either give up material or don't improve White's position. Rc5 keeps all options open while solidifying the position.\n```\nRc5\n```"
