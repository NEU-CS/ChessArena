When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: bishop on b6, rook on f2, pawns on a5, d5, e5\n- White has: king on d3, knight on c2, rook on g6, pawns on a4, b5\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook is very active on f2, attacking white's knight on c2\n- White's rook on g6 is pinning black's bishop to the king\n- Black has a passed pawn on e5 that could be dangerous\n- White's b-pawn is passed but blockaded by black's bishop\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6c7: Moving the bishop away from the pin while maintaining pressure\n- f2f8: Rook lift to potentially attack from behind\n- f2c2: Capturing the knight immediately\n- e5e4: Advancing the passed pawn\n4. Analysis:\n- f2c2 seems tempting, but after Rxc2 Bxc2, white has Rg8+ skewering the bishop\n- b6c7 looks solid, getting out of the pin while keeping the bishop active\n- e5e4 could be strong, creating a passed pawn that white must deal with\n- f2f8 is interesting to bring the rook to the 8th rank with threats\n5. Best move:\ne5e4 is the most forcing move, creating immediate threats. After:\n- If dxe4, then f2f3+ wins the rook on g6\n- If Kxe4, then f2f4+ wins the knight\n- White has no good way to stop the pawn advance without losing material\nThis move transforms the position in black's favor by creating a passed pawn and opening lines for the rook.\n```\ne5e4\n```"
