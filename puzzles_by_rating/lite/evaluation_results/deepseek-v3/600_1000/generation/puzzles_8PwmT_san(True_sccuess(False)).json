If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Black's king is exposed with only the rook covering the f-file\n4. Black's queen is awkwardly placed on a7, not contributing to defense\n5. White's pieces are well coordinated with the bishop on d3 eyeing the kingside\nKey ideas:\n- The d5 pawn is strong but needs support to advance\n- Black's kingside is vulnerable to attack\n- The f-file is open and White's rook is already on f1\n- Black's bishop on g7 is their best defensive piece\nCandidate moves:\n1. Rxf7 - Immediate sacrifice to expose the king. After Kxf7, Qh5+ forces Ke8 (Kg8 Qf7#) and White has strong threats with the bishop and queen battery\n2. Qh5 - Direct attack, but Black can defend with g6\n3. Bc4 - Developing the bishop to a more active square\n4. d6 - Pushing the passed pawn, but Black can capture with cxd6\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be Rxf7, sacrificing the rook to open up Black's king. Let's calculate:\n- Rxf7 Kxf7 (forced)\n- Qh5+ Ke8 (only move, as g6 allows Qf7#)\n- Now White has Qf7+ coming next move with devastating threats (Black can't defend both Qf7 and Bxg6 ideas)\nThis leads to a winning position for White as Black's king will be completely exposed with White's queen and bishop coordinating perfectly.\n```\nRxf7\n```"
