When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has strong pressure with rook on b7 and queen on g4\n- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n- White's pawn on g4 is threatening to advance\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qg5+ next move, forcing the king to move\n- Rb7 is threatening the d7 queen\n- The g4 pawn could advance to g5, gaining space\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d7e7: Gets the queen out of attack but blocks the e7 square for the knight\n- d7c7: Counterattacks the rook but allows Qg5+\n- g8h6: Develops the knight to a better square, defends against Qg5+\n- f7f6: Creates luft but weakens the king position\n- c5d4: Centralizes the bishop but allows Qg5+\nAfter careful consideration, g8h6 seems the most resilient move:\n- It defends against Qg5+ by controlling g5\n- Improves the knight's position\n- Doesn't weaken the king's position\n- Maintains flexibility for other pieces\nOther moves either allow immediate threats or worsen the position. For example:\n- d7e7 blocks the knight's best retreat square\n- d7c7 allows Qg5+ forcing the king to move\n- f7f6 weakens the king's position too much\nHere's the move:\n```\ng8h6\n```"
