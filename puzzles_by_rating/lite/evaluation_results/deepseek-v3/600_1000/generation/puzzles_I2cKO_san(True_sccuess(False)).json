If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White has a queen on h8 controlling the back rank\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- Black's queen is very active on f7\n- Black has a knight on g5 and rook on f2\n- White has a bishop on g4 and knight on c4\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential back rank threats with Qh8\n- Black's rook on f2 is very dangerous near White's king\n- Black's queen has many active options\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qg7: Defends against back rank mate while keeping queen active\n- Rxf1+: Immediate sacrifice to expose White's king\n- Ne6: Centralizes knight and threatens discoveries\n- Qf3: Puts more pressure on White's position\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qg7 seems too passive and allows White to consolidate\n- Rxf1+ is tempting but after Kxf1 Qf3+ Ke1 Qxh1, White has Qh8+ Ke7 Qxh7+ and Black's king remains exposed\n- Ne6 is interesting but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Qf3 is very strong, threatening both Qxf1+ and Qxc4 while maintaining pressure\nThe best move is Qf3, which:\n- Maintains all threats\n- Puts maximum pressure on White's position\n- Keeps options open for future tactics\n- Doesn't allow White any breathing room\n```\nQf3\n```"
