When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- Black has: rook, rook, bishop, bishop, knight, pawns\n- White has: rook, rook, knight, knight, bishop, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on f6 that's very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has pressure along the f-file with the rook on f4\n- Black's bishop on e6 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on h6\n3. Available moves:\n- g7h8: King moves to h8\n- g7h6: King moves to h6, capturing the bishop\nLet's evaluate both options:\ng7h8:\n- Gets the king to relative safety\n- But leaves the bishop on h6 still pinning the e6 bishop\n- White can continue attacking with moves like Rf1 or Nfg4\ng7h6:\n- Captures the bishop immediately\n- But exposes the king more\n- After Kxh6, White can play Nfg4+ with a strong attack\n- Then if Kg7, Rf7+ wins the bishop on e6\n- If Kh5, White has multiple dangerous checks\nAfter careful consideration, g7h8 is the better choice as it keeps the king safer in the corner, despite leaving the pin in place. The alternative g7h6 leads to immediate tactical problems.\n```\ng7h8\n```"
