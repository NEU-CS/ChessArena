If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

White is up a pawn and has the bishop pair advantage (since Black has no bishops).\n2. Key features:\n- White's a-pawn is passed and advanced to a5\n- Black's b-pawn is blocked by White's b3 pawn\n- Black's f4 pawn is vulnerable\n- Black's knight is on e7, somewhat passive\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Kxf4: Captures the pawn but allows ...Nf5+ forking king and bishop\n- Bxe7: Wins the knight but after Kxe7, Black's king can stop the a-pawn\n- Ke5: Centralizes the king and threatens to capture f4 next move\n- Kg5: King moves toward the kingside pawns but doesn't accomplish much\n- Kf6: Cuts off Black's king from the a-pawn but allows ...f3\n4. Best move analysis:\n- Bxe7 seems tempting but after Kxe7, Black's king can reach the queenside in time: Kd7-c7-b7xa5\n- Kxf4 Nf5+ loses the bishop\n- Ke5 is strong as it threatens both Kxf4 and Bxe7 next move\n  - If Black plays ...f3, White can respond with Bxe7 Kxe7 Kf4 and the king will stop the f-pawn\n  - If Black does nothing, White can capture f4 next move\nAfter careful consideration, Ke5 is the most flexible and strongest move, maintaining all options while improving the king's position.\n```\nKe5\n```"
