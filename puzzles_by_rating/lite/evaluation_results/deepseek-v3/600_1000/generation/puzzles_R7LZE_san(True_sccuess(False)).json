If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Key features:\n- White has a knight on e6 that's very active and potentially threatening\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on c8\n- White has a passed pawn on d3 that could become dangerous\n- Black's queen is active but could be vulnerable to tactics\n3. Threats to consider:\n- White could play Qd5+ next move, forking king and rook\n- The e6 knight could potentially fork king and rook with Nc7+\n- White's rook on d1 is eyeing the d-file\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxe6: Capturing the strong knight, but after Qxe6, White's queen becomes very active\n- Re7: Defending the e6 pawn and keeping the rook active\n- Qd7: Protecting against Qd5+ while developing the queen\n- Kb8: Getting the king to safer position\n- Rf8: Moving the rook to a safer square\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Rxe6 seems tempting but gives White too much activity\n- Re7 is solid but doesn't address the Qd5+ threat\n- Qd7 is probably best as it prevents Qd5+ while keeping options open\n- Kb8 is too passive\n- Rf8 doesn't solve any immediate problems\nThe most precise move is Qd7, which:\n- Prevents Qd5+\n- Keeps the queen active\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n```\nQd7\n```"
