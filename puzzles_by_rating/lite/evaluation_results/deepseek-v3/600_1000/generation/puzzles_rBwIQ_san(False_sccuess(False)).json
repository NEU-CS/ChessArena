When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has an extra pawn but White has more active pieces.\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g7 with White's queen and bishop eyeing the h6-g7 diagonal. White's king is relatively safe.\n3. Piece activity: White's pieces are well coordinated - queen on c2, bishop on b3, knight on g3, rook on f1. Black's pieces are less coordinated.\n4. Key observations:\n- Black's knight on h3 is undefended\n- Black's bishop on e6 is pinned to the queen\n- White has potential threats along the h6-g7 diagonal\nCandidate moves to consider:\na) g3h5 - attacking the f6 pawn and threatening Ng7\nb) c2g6 - immediate queen sacrifice, but after fxg6 Bxe6 is unclear\nc) b3d5 - challenging the bishop and opening lines\nd) c2e4 - centralizing the queen with multiple threats\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g3h5 looks strong as it threatens Ng7+ winning the queen\n- If 26...gxh5 27.Qg6+ Kh8 28.Qxh6+ Kg8 29.Qg6+ Kh8 30.Bxe6 wins material\n- Black's best is probably 26...Nf4 but then 27.Qxf5 maintains pressure\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous continuation.\n```\ng3h5\n```"
