When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: King, Rook, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: King, Rook, Knight, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but the position is very sharp with passed pawns on both sides.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a dangerous passed pawn on c4\n- Black has connected passed pawns on e5 and c5\n- Black's g2 pawn is very advanced and threatening\n- White's knight on g4 is well placed\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Kxg2 next move if we don't address it\n- Our f3 pawn is under attack by White's knight\n- Our e7 rook is somewhat awkwardly placed\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7f5: Defends the f3 pawn and opens potential for the rook\n- e7g7: Defends the g2 pawn and connects rooks\n- d6d7: Advances the king toward the action\n- b6b5: Pushes the passed pawn\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f7f5 seems best as it defends the f3 pawn and opens lines for the rook\n- e7g7 is also good but less active\n- d6d7 is too slow as White's threats are more immediate\n- b6b5 doesn't address the immediate concerns\nThe move f7f5:\n- Defends f3 pawn\n- Opens potential for the rook to swing to h5 or f4\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow White any immediate counterplay\nHere's the move:\n```\nf7f5\n```"
