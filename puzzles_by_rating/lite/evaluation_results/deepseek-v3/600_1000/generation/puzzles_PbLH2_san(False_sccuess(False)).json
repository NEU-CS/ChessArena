When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on c6, putting pressure on Black's position\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White's queen is centralized on e2\n- Black's light-squared bishop is undeveloped (c8)\n- White has castling rights while Black doesn't\n3. Threats:\n- White could castle next move, completing development\n- The knight on c6 is very strong and may need to be addressed\n- White has potential threats against f7 (queen + bishop battery)\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f8d6: Develops the bishop and challenges White's strong knight\n- e8d7: Gets the king out of the center but looks awkward\n- c8d7: Develops the bishop but blocks the d-file\n- f6d5: Challenges the knight but leaves e6 weak\n- e6e5: Gains space but weakens d5\nAfter careful consideration, f8d6 seems best because:\n- It develops a piece\n- Challenges White's strong knight\n- Maintains control over e5\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Prepares to castle queenside if possible\nOther moves either don't address the knight or create new weaknesses. For example, e8d7 would leave the king very exposed, and c8d7 would block the queen's defense of d6.\nHere's my move:\n```\nf8d6\n```"
