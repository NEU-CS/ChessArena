When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White: Rook (c7), Queen (f2), Knight (f1), pawns (b2, c4, f4, g2, h2)\n- Black: Rook (d2), Queen (d1), Bishop (b7), pawns (a7, b6, f6, g7, h6)\nWhite is down material (Queen+Rook vs Queen+Rook+Bishop), but has some active pieces.\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on d1 is threatening mate on h1\n- White's rook on c7 is very active and threatening Black's bishop\n- White's queen is centralized but needs to be careful about Black's threats\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\na) c7b7 - capturing the bishop, but after Qh1# it's mate\nb) f2h4 - defending against mate, but allows Qxf1 next move\nc) f2d4 - blocks the d-file and defends against mate\nd) h1g1 - moves the king out of danger\n4. Best move analysis:\n- h1g1 seems forced to prevent immediate mate\n- After h1g1, Black can play Qh5 with strong threats, but White can defend\n- Other moves either allow mate or lose material\n5. Conclusion:\nWe must prevent mate first, then look for counterplay. h1g1 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose.\n```\nh1g1\n```"
