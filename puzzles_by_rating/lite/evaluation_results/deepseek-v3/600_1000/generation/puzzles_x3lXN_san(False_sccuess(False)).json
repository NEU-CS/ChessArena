When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook (a1), Rook (e1), Knight (a4), Bishop (h4), Queen (f3), 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook (e8), Queen (d6), Rook (e6), Bishop (h2), 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has knight vs Black's bishop and extra pawn)\n2. Key features:\n- Black's bishop on h2 is very dangerous, pinning White's g2 pawn to the king\n- White's king is exposed on g1 with limited escape squares\n- Black has strong pressure along the e-file and h2-b8 diagonal\n- White's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n3. Candidate moves:\na) g1h1:\n- Gets out of the pin on g2\n- But moves king towards the corner where it could be more vulnerable\n- Still leaves g2 pawn pinned to h1 rook\nb) g1f1:\n- Moves king towards the center\n- Still maintains defense of g2 pawn\n- Potentially more active position for the king\n- Keeps options to potentially move to e2 later\n4. Evaluation:\n- g1f1 seems slightly better as it keeps the king more active and central\n- g1h1 risks getting trapped in the corner\n- Both moves are defensive, but the position is dangerous for White\n- The immediate threat is Qd6xh2+ if the pin isn't dealt with\nAfter careful consideration, g1f1 is the better choice as it keeps the king more active and maintains more options for defense.\n```\ng1f1\n```"
