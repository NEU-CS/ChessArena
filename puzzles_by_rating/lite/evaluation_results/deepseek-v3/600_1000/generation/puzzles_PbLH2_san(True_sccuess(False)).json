If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Q+R+B+N vs Q+R+B+N). White has a knight on c6 which is well placed.\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on c6 putting pressure on black's position\n- Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n- White's queen is centralized on e2\n- Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by the pawn on b5\n3. Problems to solve:\n- Need to develop the bishop (currently blocked)\n- Need to address the knight on c6\n- Need to consider king safety\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Qxc6: Giving up the queen for knight is bad\n- Qd7: Blocks the bishop but connects rooks\n- Be7: Develops bishop but doesn't solve knight issue\n- Bd6: Challenges the strong bishop on d3\n- e5: Gains space but weakens d5 square\n- b4: Pushes pawn but leaves c4 weak\n5. Best options seem to be:\n- Bd6: Immediately challenges white's strong bishop. After Bxd6 Qxd6, black can castle next move.\n- Qd7: Prepares to castle while keeping options open. The queen defends b5 and connects rooks.\nBetween these, Bd6 seems more active as it solves two problems at once - develops a piece and challenges white's strong bishop. After the exchange, black can castle next move with reasonable position.\n```\nBd6\n```"
