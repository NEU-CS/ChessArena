When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Q+R+B vs Q+R+B), but White has a passed e5 pawn.\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e4 is very active, eyeing the black king\n- Black's queen on g5 is also active but somewhat exposed\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on c6\n- White has pressure along the e-file and potential threats against f7\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Qxg5, but after hxg5, the position would be roughly equal\n- White might consider pushing the e-pawn or doubling rooks on the e-file\n4. Candidate moves for Black:\n- g5e3: Queen sacrifice to eliminate White's strong bishop\n- e6d5: Bishop move to challenge White's queen\n- f8e8: Rook to e-file to counter White's pressure\n- g5h5: Queen move to maintain activity while being safer\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g5e3 looks tempting but after Qxe3 Bxc4, White maintains pressure\n- e6d5 allows Qxd5 which would be bad for Black\n- f8e8 is solid but doesn't address the queen's exposure\n- g5h5 seems best, keeping the queen active while moving it to a safer square and maintaining pressure on h2\nThe move g5h5:\n- Moves the queen to a safer square\n- Maintains pressure on h2\n- Keeps options open for future play\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactical shots for White\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5h5\n```"
