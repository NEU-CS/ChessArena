        "content": "Got it, let's try to solve this problem step by step. First, I need to remember that I'm playing as Black (since the FEN ends with \"b\" for the next to move). Let's start by parsing the FEN to understand the position clearly:\n\nFEN: 6k1/2B4p/6p1/8/pbK5/6P1/7P/8 b - - 1 38\n\nBreaking down each rank from 8 to 1 (since FEN is rank 8 to 1):\n- Rank 8 (Black's back rank): 6k1 \u2192 that's 6 empty squares, then a king on g8, then 1 empty square (so squares a8-f8 empty, g8=K, h8 empty)\n- Rank 7: 2B4p \u2192 2 empty squares, a bishop on c7 (wait, no: 2 empty, then B, then 4 empty, then p. Let's count: rank 7 has 8 squares. \"2B4p\" means characters represent groups: 2 (empty), B (piece), 4 (empty), p (piece). So starting from a7: a7=empty, b7=empty, c7=B (wait, no\u2014wait, no, FEN for a rank is from file a to file h. So for rank 7, \"2B4p\" is: files a7-b7: 2 empties (so a7=., b7=.), then file c7: B (white bishop, since it's uppercase), then files d7-g7: 4 empties (d7=., e7=., f7=., g7=.), then file h7: p (black pawn, lowercase). Oh right, important: uppercase is White, lowercase is Black.\n- Rank 6: 6p1 \u2192 6 empties, then p on g6 (since 6 empties: a6-f6=., g6=p, h6=.)\n- Rank 5: 8 \u2192 all empty (a5-h5=.)\n- Rank 4: pbK5 \u2192 p on a4 (black pawn), b on b4 (black bishop), K on c4 (white king), then 5 empties (d4-h4=.)\n- Rank 3: 6P1 \u2192 6 empties (a3-f3=.), P on g3 (white pawn), h3=.)\n- Rank 2: 7P \u2192 7 empties (a2-g2=.), P on h2 (white pawn)\n- Rank 1: 8 \u2192 all empty.\n\nNow, let's list the pieces with their colors and positions to make it easier:\n- White (uppercase):\n  - King: c4 (Kc4)\n  - Bishop: c7 (Bc7) \u2192 wait no, rank 7 is \"2B4p\"\u2014wait no, no, I messed up rank 7 earlier! Wait, no: FEN strings for each rank are from left to right as file a to file h. So for a rank, the first character corresponds to file a, the second to file b, etc. But when there's a number, it's the count of empty squares. So for example, rank 8 is \"6k1\": that's 6 empty squares starting at file a, so files a8-f8 are empty (6 files), then file g8 has a king (k, since it's Black\u2014wait wait! Oh my god, I made a critical mistake here: in FEN, uppercase letters are White pieces, lowercase are Black pieces. Oh my goodness, that's essential. So let's correct all that, because that was a huge error.\n\nOkay, let's start over with FEN parsing, correctly this time, focusing on piece colors (uppercase=White, lowercase=Black):\n\nFEN string: [rank 8][rank 7][rank 6][rank 5][rank 4][rank 3][rank 2][rank 1] [color to move] [castling rights] [en passant] [halfmove clock] [fullmove number]\n\nGiven FEN: 6k1/2B4p/6p1/8/pbK5/6P1/7P/8 b - - 1 38\n\nSo let's parse each rank from 8 (top of the board, Black's starting rank) to 1 (bottom, White's starting rank), each rank is files a to h (left to right):\n\n1. Rank 8 (\"6k1\"):\n   - \"6\" means 6 consecutive empty squares starting at file a: so files a8, b8, c8, d8, e8, f8 are all empty (6 files).\n   - Next character is \"k\": that's a Black king (lowercase), so file g8 has Black's king: **Kg8** (wait, no, in chess notation, we write the piece letter (uppercase for White, lowercase for Black) followed by the square, but actually, when talking about positions, we just say the square: Black's king is on g8, White's king is on... we'll get to that.\n   - Next character is \"1\": that's 1 empty square, which is the remaining file after g8, so file h8 is empty.\n   - Summary of rank 8: a8-f8=empty, g8=Black king (\u265ag8), h8=empty.\n\n2. Rank 7 (\"2B4p\"):\n   - \"2\": 2 empty squares: files a7, b7=empty.\n   - \"B\": White bishop (uppercase), so file c7=White bishop: **\u2657c7**.\n   - \"4\": 4 empty squares: files d7, e7, f7, g7=empty.\n   - \"p\": Black pawn (lowercase), so file h7=Black pawn: **\u265f\ufe0eh7**.\n   - Summary of rank 7: a7-b7=empty, c7=\u2657, d7-g7=empty, h7=\u265f\ufe0e.\n\n3. Rank 6 (\"6p1\"):\n   - \"6\": 6 empty squares: files a6-f6=empty.\n   - \"p\": Black pawn, so file g6=Black pawn: **\u265f\ufe0eg6**.\n   - \"1\": 1 empty square: file h6=empty.\n   - Summary of rank 6: a6-f6=empty, g6=\u265f\ufe0e, h6=empty.\n\n4. Rank 5 (\"8\"): All 8 squares empty: a5-h5=empty.\n\n5. Rank 4 (\"pbK5\"):\n   - \"p\": Black pawn, file a4=Black pawn: **\u265f\ufe0ea4**.\n   - \"b\": Black bishop (lowercase), file b4=Black bishop: **\u265db4** (wait, no, in chess notation, Black's bishop is lowercase b, yes).\n   - \"K\": White king (uppercase), file c4=White king: **\u2654c4**.\n   - \"5\": 5 empty squares: files d4-h4=empty (since after a4, b4, c4, we have 5 files left: d4 to h4, which are 5 files, yes).\n   - Summary of rank 4: a4=\u265f\ufe0e, b4=\u265d, c4=\u2654, d4-h4=empty.\n\n6. Rank 3 (\"6P1\"):\n   - \"6\": 6 empty squares: a3-f3=empty.\n   - \"P\": White pawn (uppercase), file g3=White pawn: **\u2659g3**.\n   - \"1\": 1 empty square: h3=empty.\n   - Summary of rank 3: a3-f3=empty, g3=\u2659, h3=empty.\n\n7. Rank 2 (\"7P\"):\n   - \"7\": 7 empty squares: a2-g2=empty.\n   - \"P\": White pawn, file h2=White pawn: **\u2659h2**.\n   - Summary of rank 2: a2-g2=empty, h2=\u2659.\n\n8. Rank 1 (\"8\"): All empty: a1-h1=empty.\n\nGreat, that's corrected now. Now let's list all pieces with their colors and positions clearly, because that's the foundation:\n\n- **Black's pieces (lowercase in FEN, to move next since FEN has \"b\")**:\n  - King: g8 (\u265ag8)\n  - Bishops: 1 bishop on b4 (\u265db4)\n  - Pawns: 3 pawns: a4 (\u265f\ufe0ea4), g6 (\u265f\ufe0eg6), h7 (\u265f\ufe0eh7)\n  - No rooks, queens, knights visible (since FEN doesn't show them\u2014yes, the position has few pieces: Black has K, B, 3 pawns; White has K, B, 2 pawns)\n\n- **White's pieces (uppercase in FEN)**:\n  - King: c4 (\u2654c4)\n  - Bishops: 1 bishop on c7 (\u2657c7)\n  - Pawns: 2 pawns: g3 (\u2659g3), h2 (\u2659h2)\n  - No rooks, queens, knights visible.\n\nNow, let's confirm the material balance first, because that's important for strategy. Let's count points (standard values: K=infinite, Q=9, R=5, B=3, N=3, P=1):\n\n- Black: 1 B (3) + 3 P (3) = 6 points, plus king (infinite)\n- White: 1 B (3) + 2 P (2) = 5 points, plus king (infinite)\n\nSo material: Black is up 1 pawn (3 vs 2 pawns, same minor pieces). That's a small material advantage for Black. Now, we need to look at the position's dynamics: king safety, piece activity, pawn structure, threats, etc.\n\nFirst, let's note the kings' positions:\n- White's king is on c4 (\u2654c4), which is in the middle of the board (rank 4, file c). It's not in check right now, but we need to see if we can attack it.\n- Black's king is on g8 (\u265ag8), which is on the back rank, safe for now (no immediate threats from White's pieces\u2014White's bishop is on c7, which is a light-squared bishop; Black's king is on g8, a dark square, so the bishop can't attack it. White's pawns are on g3 and h2, too far to threaten the king.)\n\nNext, piece activity:\n- Black's bishop: on b4 (\u265db4). Let's see what squares it attacks. Bishops move diagonally. The bishop is on b4, which is a dark square (since b4: file b is even, rank 4 is even\u2014wait, no, square colors: a1 is dark, b1 light, etc. So b4: file b (2nd file, even), rank 4 (even). Even+even=even, but actually, the way to remember is: if the sum of the file number (a=1, b=2, ..., h=8) and rank number is even, the square is dark; if odd, light. So b4: file=2, rank=4, sum=6 (even) \u2192 dark square. So Black's bishop is a dark-squared bishop. What squares does it attack? From b4, diagonally:\n  - Northeast (up-right): c5, d6, e7, f8 (since from b4, moving right and up: each step increases file and rank by 1: b4\u2192c5\u2192d6\u2192e7\u2192f8. f8 is empty, e7 is empty, d6 is empty, c5 is empty.\n  - Northwest (up-left): a5 (file decreases by 1, rank increases by 1: b4\u2192a5. a5 is empty.\n  - Southeast (down-right): c3, d2, e1 (file increases by 1, rank decreases by 1: b4\u2192c3\u2192d2\u2192e1. c3 is empty, d2 is empty, e1 is empty.\n  - Southwest (down-left): a3 (file decreases by 1, rank decreases by 1: b4\u2192a3. a3 is empty.\n  - Also, does it attack any White pieces? White's king is on c4 (\u2654c4). Is c4 in the bishop's attack range? The bishop is on b4. The king is on c4, which is the same rank (rank 4) as the bishop\u2014bishops don't move horizontally, so no, the bishop doesn't attack the king. White's bishop is on c7 (\u2657c7), which is a light-squared bishop (c7: file=3, rank=7, sum=10, even? Wait no, 3+7=10, even, but c7 is a dark square? Wait no, let's just look up (mentally) c7: yes, c7 is a dark square (like a1, c1, e1, g1 are dark; b1, d1, f1, h1 are light; same for ranks: a7 is dark, b7 light, c7 dark, etc.). Wait, but White's bishop is on c7 (dark square), and Black's bishop is on b4 (dark square)\u2014so both bishops are on dark squares? Wait no, no\u2014wait b4: let's think of the board: the square b4 is to the right of a4 (which is dark, like a1), so b4 is light? Oh my god, I'm confusing myself. Let's just forget square colors for a second\u2014what's important is what the bishop attacks. The bishop on b4 (\u265db4) is attacking along the diagonals: as I listed, northeast to f8, northwest to a5, southeast to e1, southwest to a3. None of White's pieces are on those diagonals right now (White's king is on c4, which is same rank as b4, so not diagonal; White's bishop is on c7, which is same file as b4? No, c7 is file c, rank 7; b4 is file b, rank 4\u2014so the diagonal from c7 would be d6, e5, f4, etc., or b6, a5\u2014so the bishop on c7 is attacking a5 (northwest) and d6, e5, f4 (southeast). White's pawns are on g3 and h2\u2014no threat from them to Black's pieces.\n\nBlack's pawns: a4 (\u265f\ufe0ea4), g6 (\u265f\ufe0eg6), h7 (\u265f\ufe0eh7). Let's see their status:\n- a4 pawn: it's on a4, which is rank 4. Pawns move forward (for Black, forward is down the board, i.e., decreasing rank). So the a4 pawn can move to a3 (since it's not a capture, and the square a3 is empty\u2014wait, rank 3 has \"6P1\", so a3 is empty, yes). Also, can it capture? Pawns capture diagonally forward. The a4 pawn is on a4 (file a, rank 4). To capture, it would need to go to b3 (file b, rank 3), but b3 is empty (rank 3 has 6 empties from a3-f3, so b3 is empty). So the a4 pawn's legal moves are a4a3 (from the list of legal moves, yes, \"a4a3\" is there).\n- g6 pawn: on g6 (rank 6). Can move to g5 (rank 5, which is empty\u2014yes, \"g6g5\" is in the legal moves). Can it capture? To capture, it would need to go to f5 or h5, but both are empty (rank 5 is all empty). So legal move: g6g5.\n- h7 pawn: on h7 (rank 7). Can move to h6 (rank 6, empty\u2014\"h7h6\" is legal) or h5 (rank 5, empty\u2014\"h7h5\" is legal). Can it capture? To capture, it would need to go to g6 or i8 (but i8 doesn't exist), so g6 is a pawn (Black's own pawn!), so no capture possible. So legal moves: h7h6, h7h5 (both in the list).\n\nBlack's king: on g8 (\u265ag8). What are its legal moves? Kings move one square in any direction. The king is on g8. Let's see adjacent squares:\n- g7: is that allowed? The square g7 is empty (rank 7 has d7-g7 empty), and is it under attack by White? White's pieces: White's king is on c4 (can't attack g7, too far), White's bishop is on c7 (attacks along diagonals\u2014c7's diagonals: as we said, northwest to a5, southeast to d6, e5, f4. g7 is not on those diagonals. White's pawns are on g3 and h2\u2014can't attack g7. So g7 is safe for the king.\n- f8: empty (rank 8 has a8-f8 empty), safe? White's bishop is on c7\u2014does it attack f8? c7 to f8 is a diagonal (c7\u2192d8\u2192e8\u2192f8? No, c7 to d8 is one step right and up, but f8 is three steps right from c7: c7\u2192d8\u2192e8\u2192f8? No, wait, bishop moves diagonally, so each step must change both file and rank by 1. So from c7 (file c=3, rank 7), moving right and up would be d8 (file 4, rank 8), but f8 is file 6, rank 8\u2014so to get from c7 to f8, you need to move 3 files right and 1 rank up, which is not a diagonal move (it's a rook move). So White's bishop on c7 does not attack f8. So f8 is safe for the king.\n- h8: empty (rank 8 has h8 empty), safe? White's bishop on c7\u2014does it attack h8? c7 to h8: file increases by 5 (c to h is 5 files), rank increases by 1 (7 to 8). Not a diagonal (needs equal file and rank change). So no, h8 is safe.\n- f7: empty (rank 7 has d7-g7 empty), safe? White's bishop on c7\u2014does it attack f7? c7 to f7 is three files right, same rank\u2014rook move, not bishop. So f7 is safe.\n- So the king's legal moves are g8h8 (to h8), g8f8 (to f8), g8g7 (to g7), g8f7 (to f7)\u2014all of which are in the list of legal moves (yes, the first four moves in the list are king moves).\n\nNow, let's list all legal moves again (given) and categorize them to make it easier:\n\nLegal moves (Black to play):\n1. King moves (\u265ag8):\n   - g8h8 (king to h8)\n   - g8f8 (king to f8)\n   - g8g7 (king to g7)\n   - g8f7 (king to f7)\n2. Bishop moves (\u265db4):\n   - b4f8 (bishop to f8)\n   - b4e7 (bishop to e7)\n   - b4d6 (bishop to d6)\n   - b4c5 (bishop to c5)\n   - b4a5 (bishop to a5)\n   - b4c3 (bishop to c3)\n   - b4a3 (bishop to a3)\n   - b4d2 (bishop to d2)\n   - b4e1 (bishop to e1)\n   - (Note: These are all the diagonal moves from b4 that are legal\u2014since bishops can move any number of squares diagonally, as long as the path is clear. Let's confirm one: b4f8\u2014from b4 to f8: that's northeast diagonal (right and up). The path is b4\u2192c5\u2192d6\u2192e7\u2192f8. Are all those squares empty? c5 is empty (rank 5 is all empty), d6 is empty (rank 6 has a6-f6 empty), e7 is empty (rank 7 has d7-g7 empty), f8 is empty (rank 8 has a8-f8 empty). Yes, so that's a legal move. Another: b4e7\u2014from b4 to e7: let's see, what's the diagonal? b4 to e7: file increases by 3 (b\u2192e), rank increases by 3 (4\u21927)\u2014so yes, diagonal (equal file and rank change). Path: b4\u2192c5\u2192d6\u2192e7. All squares empty, yes, legal. b4d6: file increases by 2 (b\u2192d), rank increases by 2 (4\u21926)\u2014diagonal, path b4\u2192c5\u2192d6, empty, legal. b4c5: file increases by 1 (b\u2192c), rank increases by 1 (4\u21925)\u2014diagonal, square c5 empty, legal. b4a5: file decreases by 1 (b\u2192a), rank increases by 1 (4\u21925)\u2014diagonal, square a5 empty, legal. b4c3: file increases by 1 (b\u2192c), rank decreases by 1 (4\u21923)\u2014diagonal, square c3 empty (rank 3 has a3-f3 empty), legal. b4a3: file decreases by 1 (b\u2192a), rank decreases by 1 (4\u21923)\u2014diagonal, square a3 empty, legal. b4d2: file increases by 2 (b\u2192d), rank decreases by 2 (4\u21922)\u2014diagonal, square d2 empty (rank 2 has a2-g2 empty), legal. b4e1: file increases by 3 (b\u2192e), rank decreases by 3 (4\u21921)\u2014diagonal, square e1 empty (rank 1 is all empty), legal. Okay, all bishop moves are valid.\n3. Pawn moves:\n   - h7h6 (h7 pawn to h6, non-capture)\n   - g6g5 (g6 pawn to g5, non-capture)\n   - a4a3 (a4 pawn to a3, non-capture)\n   - h7h5 (h7 pawn to h5, non-capture\u2014wait, pawns move one square forward, except for their first move where they can move two. Wait, where are these pawns? The h7 pawn: is it on its starting square? Black's pawns start on rank 7 (h7 is a starting square for Black's h-pawn). Oh right! Black's pawns start on rank 7, so if a pawn is on rank 7 and hasn't moved yet, it can move one or two squares forward. Wait, but has the h7 pawn moved? The FEN is from a game at move 38 (fullmove number 38), so it's possible, but we don't know. Wait no\u2014wait, no, in chess, pawns on their starting rank (for Black, rank 7; for White, rank 2) can move two squares forward on their first move, but once they move, they can only move one. But in this position, the h7 pawn is on h7 (Black's starting rank for h-pawn). Is there any way to know if it's moved before? No, but the legal moves list includes h7h6 (one square) and h7h5 (two squares)\u2014so that means the h7 pawn is on its starting square and hasn't moved yet, so it can move one or two squares. Oh right! Because the legal moves are given, so if h7h5 is a legal move, that means the pawn is allowed to move two squares, which only happens if it's on its starting rank and hasn't moved. So yes, h7 pawn is on starting rank (h7), can move to h6 or h5. Similarly, g6 pawn: is it on starting rank? No, Black's g-pawn starts on g7; this one is on g6, so it's moved before, so it can only move one square forward (to g5), which is in the legal moves (g6g5). a4 pawn: starts on a7; it's on a4, so it's moved multiple times, can only move one square forward (to a3), which is in the list (a4a3). Okay, that's why those pawn moves are legal.\n\nNow, our goal is to choose the best move from all these legal moves. Let's think about strategy first: Black is up a pawn (material advantage), so we want to maintain or increase that advantage, improve our piece activity, restrict White's pieces, and eventually convert the pawn advantage into a win.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate bad moves\u2014moves that lose material, or allow White to gain an advantage, or weaken our position.\n\nLet's start with king moves. The king is on g8, safe. If we move the king, where? Let's see:\n- g8h8: moves the king to h8, which is a corner. Is there any reason to do that? Probably not\u2014h8 is a passive square, and the king is already safe on g8.\n- g8f8: moves the king to f8, another back-rank square. Again, passive, no immediate benefit.\n- g8g7: moves the king to g7, which is in front of the g6 pawn. Wait, the g6 pawn is on g6 (rank 6), so g7 is the square in front of it. If the king moves to g7, is that safe? White's bishop is on c7\u2014does it attack g7? c7 to g7 is same rank (rank 7), so no, bishop can't attack same rank. White's king is on c4, too far. White's pawns are on g3 and h2\u2014can't attack g7. So g7 is safe, but moving the king there blocks the g6 pawn's path (since the pawn is on g6, it wants to move to g5, g4, etc., and the king on g7 would block it). Also, the king is better on the back rank for now, since the center is occupied by White's king. Probably not a good move.\n- g8f7: moves the king to f7. Is that safe? White's bishop is on c7\u2014c7 to f7 is same rank (rank 7), so no attack. White's king is on c4, too far. But again, passive, and blocks any potential movement of the f-file (which is empty, but still). Not useful.\nSo all king moves are passive and don't help Black's position. We can probably eliminate all king moves from consideration, since they don't improve our position\u2014we have better moves with other pieces.\n\nNext, let's look at pawn moves. Pawns are important for structure and promotion. Let's analyze each pawn move:\n- a4a3: moves the a4 pawn to a3. What's the effect? The pawn is now on a3 (rank 3). White has a pawn on g3 (rank 3), but no pawn on a3. Is this a good move? The a-pawn is on the edge, and moving it forward doesn't create any threats (White's king is on c4, too far to be attacked by the pawn). Also, the pawn on a3 is now closer to promotion, but it's an edge pawn, which is the least valuable for promotion (since it has to go all the way to a1, which is 5 more moves). But does it help Black? Not really\u2014there's no immediate benefit, and it doesn't improve the pawn structure. Maybe not the best move.\n- g6g5: moves the g6 pawn to g5 (rank 5). The g-pawn is on rank 5 now. White has a pawn on g3 (rank 3). What's the effect? The g5 pawn is now two squares away from White's g3 pawn. If White's g3 pawn moves to g4, it would attack the g5 pawn, but White's king is on c4\u2014would White want to move the pawn? Maybe not, but Black's g5 pawn is now more active. Also, the g-pawn is a central pawn (more valuable than edge pawns), so moving it forward is better than moving the a-pawn. But is there a threat here? No, not immediately. But let's see if there's a better pawn move.\n- h7h6: moves the h7 pawn to h6 (rank 6). The h-pawn is on rank 6 now. White has a pawn on h2 (rank 2). What's the effect? The h-pawn is moving forward, but it's an edge pawn. Moving to h6 doesn't create any threats (White's king is on c4, too far). Also, if the h-pawn moves to h6, it's one step closer to promotion, but again, edge pawn. Not the best.\n- h7h5: moves the h7 pawn to h5 (rank 5). This is a two-square move (since it's on starting rank). The h-pawn is now on h5 (rank 5). White has a pawn on h2 (rank 2). What's the effect? The h5 pawn is further forward than h6, but again, it's an edge pawn. Moving it two squares doesn't create any threats, and it's vulnerable to being attacked by White's h2 pawn if White moves h2h4 (but White's turn is next, but we have to think about our move first). Is this better than h7h6? Maybe, but again, edge pawn. Not the best.\n\nNow, let's think about pawn structure: Black has pawns on a4, g6, h7. White has pawns on g3, h2. So on the g-file: Black has g6, White has g3\u2014so Black's g-pawn is ahead of White's g-pawn (g6 vs g3). On the h-file: Black has h7, White has h2\u2014Black's h-pawn is on starting rank, White's h-pawn is on h2 (rank 2). On the a-file: Black has a4, White has no a-pawn.\n\nIf Black moves g6g5 (g-pawn to g5), then the g-pawn is on g5 (rank 5), which is two squares ahead of White's g3 pawn (rank 3). That creates a passed pawn? No, because White has a pawn on g3, so the g5 pawn is not passed (a passed pawn is a pawn that has no enemy pawns in front of it on the same file or adjacent files). Wait, no\u2014passed pawn is a pawn that cannot be blocked or captured by enemy pawns along its path to promotion. The g5 pawn: White has a pawn on g3 (same file), so White's g3 pawn can block or capture the g5 pawn. So not a passed pawn. But moving the g-pawn forward puts pressure on White's g3 pawn\u2014if White's g3 pawn moves to g4, then Black's g5 pawn can capture it (g5g4, but wait, no\u2014pawns capture diagonally. If White's g3 pawn moves to g4 (rank 4), then Black's g5 pawn (rank 5) is on the same file, so to capture, the Black pawn would need to move diagonally, but there's no piece on f4 or h4 (since rank 4 has d4-h4 empty). So no, the g5 pawn can't capture the g4 pawn\u2014they are on the same file, so the g5 pawn would be blocked by the g4 pawn. So moving g6g5 doesn't create an immediate threat, but it's a pawn move forward, which is usually good, but is there a better move?\n\nWhat about h7h5 (h-pawn to h5)? That's a two-square move (since h7 is starting rank). The h5 pawn is now on rank 5, ahead of White's h2 pawn (rank 2). Again, not a passed pawn (White has h2 pawn), but it's a forward move. But h-pawn is edge, so less valuable than g-pawn.\n\na4a3: as we said, edge pawn, not useful.\n\nSo pawn moves are okay, but do they help us gain an advantage? Maybe, but we have a bishop that's active, and maybe we can use the bishop to attack White's king or pieces.\n\nNow, the most important moves to consider are the bishop moves, since the bishop is a minor piece that can be very active, especially in the middle game. Black's bishop is on b4 (\u265db4), and it has many legal moves (9 moves). Let's analyze each bishop move to see which one is best.\n\nFirst, let's recall what White's pieces are: White has a king on c4 (\u2654c4), a bishop on c7 (\u2657c7), and pawns on g3 (\u2659g3) and h2 (\u2659h2). The most important White piece is the king, since if we can attack it, we can gain an advantage (check, checkmate, or force the king to a worse position).\n\nBlack's bishop is on b4. Let's see if any of the bishop moves can attack White's king (\u2654c4). The king is on c4. To attack the king with the bishop, the bishop needs to be on a square that is diagonal to c4. Is b4 diagonal to c4? No, b4 and c4 are on the same rank (rank 4), so they are adjacent horizontally, not diagonally. So the bishop on b4 is not attacking the king, but can it move to a square that attacks the king?\n\nLet's list the bishop's legal moves again and see if any of them put the king in check:\n- b4f8: moves to f8. Is f8 diagonal to c4? c4 to f8: file increases by 3 (c\u2192f), rank increases by 4 (4\u21928)\u2014not equal, so no.\n- b4e7: moves to e7. c4 to e7: file +2, rank +3\u2014no.\n- b4d6: moves to d6. c4 to d6: file +1, rank +2\u2014no.\n- b4c5: moves to c5. c4 to c5: same file\u2014no.\n- b4a5: moves to a5. c4 to a5: file -2, rank +1\u2014no.\n- b4c3: moves to c3. c4 to c3: same file\u2014no.\n- b4a3: moves to a3. c4 to a3: file -2, rank -1\u2014no.\n- b4d2: moves to d2. c4 to d2: file +1, rank -2\u2014no.\n- b4e1: moves to e1. c4 to e1: file +2, rank -3\u2014no.\n\nWait, none of the bishop's legal moves put White's king in check. That's a shame, but maybe the bishop can attack another White piece? White's other pieces are the bishop on c7 (\u2657c7) and pawns on g3 (\u2659g3) and h2 (\u2659h2).\n\nCan the bishop attack White's bishop on c7? White's bishop is on c7. To attack it with Black's bishop, Black's bishop needs to be on the same diagonal as c7. Let's see: what diagonals is c7 on? The diagonals through c7 are:\n- The diagonal from a5 to g1 (squares a5, b6, c7, d8, e9... but e9 is off the board). So squares a5, b6, c7, d8.\n- The diagonal from e5 to a9 (off the board) or e5 to g7 (squares e5, f6, g7, h8). Wait, no, let's do it properly: c7 is file c (3), rank 7 (7). The two diagonals are:\n  1. The diagonal where file + rank = constant: 3+7=10. So squares on this diagonal are: a8 (1+8=9? No, wait no\u2014wait, the two diagonals through a square (x,y) are:\n     a. x + y = constant (the \"main\" diagonal for that square)\n     b. x - y = constant (the other diagonal)\n  So for c7 (x=3, y=7):\n  - x + y = 10: squares where file + rank =10: a9 (invalid), b8 (2+8=10), c7 (3+7=10), d6 (4+6=10), e5 (5+5=10), f4 (6+4=10), g3 (7+3=10), h2 (8+2=10). Ah, right! So the diagonal through c7 where file + rank =10 includes b8, c7, d6, e5, f4, g3, h2.\n  - x - y = -4: squares where file - rank = -4: a5 (1-5=-4), b6 (2-6=-4), c7 (3-7=-4), d8 (4-8=-4), e9 (invalid), etc. So that diagonal includes a5, b6, c7, d8.\n\nNow, Black's bishop is on b4 (x=2, y=4). What diagonals is it on?\n- x + y = 6: 2+4=6. Squares: a5 (1+5=6), b4 (2+4=6), c3 (3+3=6), d2 (4+2=6), e1 (5+1=6).\n- x - y = -2: 2-4=-2. Squares: a3 (1-3=-2), b4 (2-4=-2), c5 (3-5=-2), d6 (4-6=-2), e7 (5-7=-2), f8 (6-8=-2).\n\nAh! So Black's bishop on b4 is on the diagonal x - y = -2, which includes e7 (5-7=-2) and f8 (6-8=-2). Wait, but White's bishop is on c7 (3-7=-4), which is on a different diagonal (x - y = -4). So Black's bishop can't attack White's bishop with a single move, since they are on different diagonals.\n\nWhat about attacking White's pawns? White's pawns are on g3 (\u2659g3) and h2 (\u2659h2). Let's see if Black's bishop can attack them:\n- White's g3 pawn (g3) is on file g, rank 3. Is g3 on any of Black's bishop's diagonals? Black's bishop is on b4 (x=2, y=4). The diagonals are x+y=6 (a5, b4, c3, d2, e1) and x-y=-2 (a3, b4, c5, d6, e7, f8). g3: x=7, y=3. x+y=10, x-y=4\u2014so no, g3 is not on either of Black's bishop's diagonals. So the bishop can't attack g3.\n- White's h2 pawn (h2) is on file h, rank 2. x=8, y=2. x+y=10, x-y=6\u2014again, not on Black's bishop's diagonals. So the bishop can't attack h2 either.\n\nHmm, so the bishop can't attack any of White's pieces with a single move. But maybe the bishop can move to a square that improves its activity, i.e., a square where it controls more squares, or puts pressure on White's position, or prepares for future attacks.\n\nLet's look at the bishop's legal moves again and see which ones put it on a more active square:\n- b4f8: moves to f8. Where is f8? It's on rank 8, file f\u2014empty square. What squares does the bishop control from f8? F8 is a dark square (x=6, y=8: x+y=14, even\u2014dark). The bishop on f8 would control the diagonals:\n  - x+y=14: f8 (6+8=14), g7 (7+7=14), h6 (8+6=14).\n  - x-y=-2: f8 (6-8=-2), e7 (5-7=-2), d6 (4-6=-2), c5 (3-5=-2), b4 (2-4=-2), a3 (1-3=-2).\n  So from f8, the bishop controls squares f8, g7, h6 (from x+y=14) and f8, e7, d6, c5, b4, a3 (from x-y=-2). That's a lot of squares, but is f8 a good square? The bishop on f8 is on the back rank, behind Black's king (which is on g8). It's not attacking anything, and it's blocked by the king if it wants to move further up the board. Not very active.\n- b4e7: moves to e7. E7 is on rank 7, file e\u2014empty square. What squares does the bishop control from e7? E7 is x=5, y=7. Diagonals:\n  - x+y=12: d8 (4+8=12), e7 (5+7=12), f6 (6+6=12), g5 (7+5=12), h4 (8+4=12).\n  - x-y=-2: e7 (5-7=-2), f8 (6-8=-2), d6 (4-6=-2), c5 (3-5=-2), b4 (2-4=-2), a3 (1-3=-2).\n  So from e7, the bishop controls squares d8, e7, f6, g5, h4 (x+y=12) and e7, f8, d6, c5, b4, a3 (x-y=-2). That's a lot of squares! And e7 is a central square (rank 7, but file e is central). Also, look at the x+y=12 diagonal: it includes g5 (which is where the g6 pawn can move to) and h4 (empty). The x-y=-2 diagonal includes d6 (empty), c5 (empty), b4 (original square), a3 (empty). Is there any threat from e7? The bishop on e7 is attacking h4 (empty), g5 (empty), f6 (empty), d8 (empty). No immediate threats, but it's a more active square than b4\u2014controls more central squares.\n- b4d6: moves to d6. D6 is on rank 6, file d\u2014empty square. What squares does the bishop control from d6? D6 is x=4, y=6. Diagonals:\n  - x+y=10: c7 (3+7=10), d6 (4+6=10), e5 (5+5=10), f4 (6+4=10), g3 (7+3=10), h2 (8+2=10).\n  - x-y=-2: d6 (4-6=-2), e7 (5-7=-2), f8 (6-8=-2), c5 (3-5=-2), b4 (2-4=-2), a3 (1-3=-2).\n  Oh! Wait a minute! The x+y=10 diagonal from d6 includes c7 (White's bishop!), e5 (empty), f4 (empty), g3 (White's pawn!), h2 (White's pawn!). Oh my god! That's a huge deal. Let's repeat that: if Black's bishop moves to d6 (b4d6), then it will be on the diagonal x+y=10, which includes:\n  - c7: White's bishop (\u2657c7)\n  - g3: White's pawn (\u2659g3)\n  - h2: White's pawn (\u2659h2)\n  And the other diagonal (x-y=-2) includes e7 (empty), f8 (empty), c5 (empty), b4 (original square), a3 (empty).\n\nWait, let's confirm: d6 is x=4, y=6. x+y=10. So squares where file + rank =10 are:\n- File a: a9 (invalid, since rank 9 doesn't exist)\n- File b: b8 (2+8=10)\n- File c: c7 (3+7=10) \u2192 yes! White's bishop is on c7.\n- File d: d6 (4+6=10) \u2192 the bishop's new position.\n- File e: e5 (5+5=10) \u2192 empty.\n- File f: f4 (6+4=10) \u2192 empty.\n- File g: g3 (7+3=10) \u2192 yes! White's pawn is on g3.\n- File h: h2 (8+2=10) \u2192 yes! White's pawn is on h2.\n\nOh wow! So if Black's bishop moves to d6 (b4d6), it will be attacking White's bishop on c7 (\u2657c7) and White's pawns on g3 (\u2659g3) and h2 (\u2659h2) all at the same time! Because all three of those pieces are on the same diagonal (x+y=10) as d6. Is that possible? Let's check again:\n\n- White's bishop is on c7: c7 is file c (3), rank 7 (7). 3+7=10. Correct.\n- White's pawn is on g3: g3 is file g (7), rank 3 (3). 7+3=10. Correct.\n- White's pawn is on h2: h2 is file h (8), rank 2 (2). 8+2=10. Correct.\n- Black's bishop moving to d6: d6 is file d (4), rank 6 (6). 4+6=10. Correct.\n\nYes! All four squares (c7, d6, g3, h2) are on the same diagonal (file + rank =10). That means that if Black's bishop is on d6, it is attacking all three of White's non-king pieces (bishop and two pawns) because they are on that diagonal. Is that true?\n\nWait, in chess, a bishop attacks all squares on its diagonals, regardless of whether there are pieces in between? No! Wait no\u2014no, a bishop can only move to a square on its diagonal if the path is clear (no pieces blocking). But when we talk about \"attacking\" a square, it means that the bishop can move to that square on the next move if the path is clear. Wait, no\u2014actually, a piece \"attacks\" a square if it can move to that square on its next turn, following the rules of movement, regardless of whether there are pieces in between (but if there are pieces in between, it can't move there, so it doesn't attack that square). Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Let's clarify:\n\nFor a bishop, the squares it \"controls\" are all the squares on its diagonals that are reachable without passing through other pieces. So if there's a piece (friend or foe) on a diagonal, the bishop controls all squares from its current position up to (but not including) that piece. If the piece is a foe, the bishop can capture it (so it controls that square). If the piece is a friend, the bishop can't move past it (so it doesn't control the squares beyond the friend).\n\nIn this case, if Black's bishop moves to d6 (b4d6), what is on the x+y=10 diagonal? Let's list the squares on x+y=10 from d6's perspective (d6 is in the middle of the diagonal):\n- To the left and up (file decreases, rank increases): c7 (White's bishop) \u2192 that's one square away from d6 (c7 is file c, rank 7; d6 is file d, rank 6\u2014so one step left and up).\n- To the right and down (file increases, rank decreases): e5 (empty), f4 (empty), g3 (White's pawn), h2 (White's pawn) \u2192 these are to the right and down from d6 (d6\u2192e5\u2192f4\u2192g3\u2192h2).\n\nSo from d6, the bishop's x+y=10 diagonal has:\n- Left-up: c7 (White's bishop) \u2192 one step away, no pieces in between (d6 and c7 are adjacent diagonally), so the bishop on d6 can capture the White bishop on c7 (since it's an enemy piece).\n- Right-down: e5 (empty), f4 (empty), g3 (White's pawn), h2 (White's pawn) \u2192 from d6, the path to g3 is d6\u2192e5\u2192f4\u2192g3 (three steps), all empty, so the bishop on d6 controls g3 (can move to g3 on the next turn if the path is still clear). The path to h2 is d6\u2192e5\u2192f4\u2192g3\u2192h2 (four steps), so the bishop controls h2 only if the path is clear\u2014since g3 has a White pawn, the bishop can't move past g3 to h2, but it can capture the g3 pawn (if it wants to) on the next turn.\n\nOh! So I made a mistake earlier: the bishop on d6 doesn't attack h2 directly, because there's a White pawn on g3 blocking the path. But it does attack c7 (White's bishop) directly (adjacent diagonally, no pieces in between) and it attacks g3 (White's pawn) indirectly (path is clear from d6 to g3, so it can capture g3 on the next move).\n\nWait, that's a huge difference! So if Black's bishop is on d6, it is attacking White's bishop on c7 (\u2657c7) with a direct, immediate threat (can capture it on the next move, since there's no pieces in between). Is that true? Let's see: d6 to c7 is a diagonal move (one step left and up), and there are no pieces between d6 and c7 (d6 is empty, c7 has White's bishop\u2014no pieces in between). So yes! If Black's bishop moves to d6, it is attacking White's bishop on c7, which means that White has to respond to that threat (either move the bishop, block the attack, or capture the attacking piece).\n\nThat's a critical point I missed earlier. So b4d6 is a move that puts White's bishop under attack. Why is that important? Because if Black can capture White's bishop, then Black will have a material advantage of a bishop plus a pawn (since Black is already up a pawn), which is a decisive material advantage (bishop is 3 points, pawn is 1\u2014total 4 points advantage), which should be enough to win the game.\n\nWait, but hold on: when Black moves the bishop to d6, is White's bishop on c7 attacked? Let's confirm the positions again:\n- Black's bishop is moving from b4 to d6 (b4d6). After this move, Black's bishop is on d6.\n- White's bishop is on c7 (\u2657c7), which is on the same diagonal (x+y=10) as d6.\n- The path from d6 to c7 is a single diagonal step (d6\u2192c7), and there are no pieces between them (since d6 is now Black's bishop, and c7 is White's bishop\u2014no other pieces in between).\n- Therefore, Black's bishop on d6 is attacking White's bishop on c7, and can capture it on the next move (if White doesn't do anything about it).\n\nIs there any reason why this attack isn't valid? Let's check if White's bishop is on c7\u2014yes, according to the FEN parsing, White's bishop is on c7 (rank 7 has \"2B4p\", which is a7-b7 empty, c7=B, d7-g7 empty, h7=p). Correct.\n\nNow, what can White do in response to Black's move b4d6 (attacking the bishop on c7)? White has to save the bishop, because if they lose it, they will be in a hopeless position (material down by bishop and pawn). So White's options are:\n1. Move the bishop from c7 to a square that is not attacked by Black's bishop on d6. Where can the bishop move? White's bishop is on c7 (light or dark square? Let's not care\u2014what's important is its legal moves). White's bishop on c7 can move diagonally. The squares it can move to depend on the path:\n   - To the left and up: b8 (empty), a9 (invalid) \u2192 so can move to b8.\n   - To the right and up: d8 (empty), e9 (invalid) \u2192 can move to d8.\n   - To the left and down: b6 (empty), a5 (empty) \u2192 can move to b6 or a5.\n   - To the right and down: d6 (Black's bishop, which is attacking it\u2014can't move there, but can capture it? Wait, yes! White's bishop on c7 is being attacked by Black's bishop on d6, but White's bishop can capture Black's bishop on d6 (since it's a diagonal move, and the path is clear). Oh right! I forgot that\u2014when a piece is attacked, it can sometimes capture the attacking piece.\n\nAh, that's a key point. So when Black moves b4d6, attacking White's bishop on c7, White has the option to capture Black's bishop on d6 with their own bishop on c7 (\u2657c7xd6). Is that a good move for White? Let's see:\n- If White captures the bishop (\u2657c7xd6), then the material balance changes: Black was up a pawn (3 vs 2 pawns, same bishops). After capturing, Black loses a bishop (so Black's material is 0 bishops, 3 pawns), White loses a bishop (White's material is 0 bishops, 2 pawns). So Black is still up a pawn (3 vs 2), but both sides have no bishops. Is that better for White? Well, it's better than losing the bishop and not capturing, but Black still has a pawn advantage, and now the board is open for the kings to be more active. But wait, is there any reason why White can't capture the bishop? No\u2014capturing is a legal move (since it's a diagonal move, and the path is clear).\n\nBut wait, hold on: when Black moves b4d6, is the bishop on d6 attacked by any White pieces? Let's see: White's pieces are king on c4, bishop on c7, pawns on g3 and h2. After Black's move b4d6, Black's bishop is on d6. Is d6 attacked by White's king? White's king is on c4\u2014d6 is two squares away (c4\u2192d5\u2192d6), so no. Is d6 attacked by White's bishop on c7? Yes! White's bishop on c7 is on the same diagonal as d6 (x+y=10), and the path is clear (one step), so White's bishop can capture Black's bishop on d6. Is d6 attacked by White's pawns? No\u2014pawns are on g3 and h2, too far.\n\nSo White's best response to b4d6 is to capture the attacking bishop (\u2657c7xd6), which would eliminate Black's bishop but also lose their own bishop, keeping Black's material advantage at one pawn. But is there a way for Black to avoid this capture? No\u2014because when you attack a piece with a piece of equal value (bishop vs bishop), the opponent can capture your piece, and it's a trade.\n\nBut wait, is there any other piece that can support Black's bishop on d6, so that if White captures it, they lose more material? Let's see: Black's pieces after moving b4d6 are king on g8, bishop on d6, pawns on a4, g6, h7. Is any of these pieces attacking d6? Black's king is on g8\u2014too far. Black's pawns are on a4, g6, h7\u2014too far. So no, Black's bishop on d6 is not supported by any other pieces, so White can capture it safely (no recapture).\n\nBut even though White can capture the bishop, is moving b4d6 still a good move for Black? Let's think: Black is up a pawn, and if they can trade bishops, that's usually good for the side with a pawn advantage, because it reduces the number of pieces on the board, making it easier to promote the pawn. Also, after the trade (\u2657c7xd6), what does the position look like?\n- Black's bishop is captured, so Black has no bishops.\n- White's bishop is captured, so White has no bishops.\n- Black's pawns: a4, g6, h7 (still 3 pawns).\n- White's pawns: g3, h2 (still 2 pawns).\n- Kings: Black's king on g8, White's king on c4.\n\nIn this endgame (king and pawns vs king and pawns), Black is up a pawn, which is a winning advantage (assuming correct play). Because in king and pawn endgames, an extra pawn usually leads to promotion, which leads to checkmate.\n\nAh! That's the key. Even though White can capture Black's bishop, the trade leads to a king and pawn endgame where Black is up a pawn, which is a winning position. And since Black is the one initiating the trade, they can force this winning endgame.\n\nIs there any other move that Black can make that leads to a better position than this? Let's think: are there any other moves that can force a trade or gain material?\n\nWe already considered king moves (passive), pawn moves (no immediate gain), and other bishop moves. Let's check the other bishop moves to see if any of them can force a better trade or gain material:\n- b4c5: moves to c5. Does this attack anything? c5 is empty. The bishop on c5 would control diagonals, but no immediate attacks. White's king is on c4 (same file), so no attack. No benefit.\n- b4a5: moves to a5. Empty square, no attacks.\n- b4c3: moves to c3. Empty square, no attacks.\n- b4a3: moves to a3. Empty square, no attacks.\n- b4d2: moves to d2. Empty square, no attacks.\n- b4e1: moves to e1. Empty square, no attacks.\n- b4f8: moves to f8. Empty square, no attacks.\n- b4e7: moves to e7. As we analyzed earlier, controls more squares, but doesn't attack any White pieces, so White doesn't have to respond to any threat\u2014they can do whatever they want (like improve their king's position or move their pawns).\n\nThe only bishop move that creates an immediate threat (attacking White's bishop) is b4d6, which forces White to either lose the bishop (which is catastrophic) or trade bishops (which leads to a winning king and pawn endgame for Black).\n\nNow, let's confirm that b4d6 is a legal move\u2014yes, it's in the list of legal moves (the third bishop move in the list).\n\nIs there any reason why b4d6 is not the best move? Let's think about White's other options in response to b4d6. We said White can capture the bishop (\u2657c7xd6) or move the bishop. What if White moves the bishop instead of capturing? For example, White moves the bishop from c7 to b6 (\u2657c7\u2192b6). What happens then?\n- If White moves the bishop to b6, then Black's bishop on d6 is no longer under attack (since White's bishop is on b6), and Black's bishop on d6 is still attacking... nothing (since White's bishop moved away). But wait, no\u2014Black's bishop on d6 was attacking White's bishop on c7, but White moved the bishop to b6, so the attack is gone. But what about Black's other pieces? Black is still up a pawn, but now the bishops are both on the board. Is this better for Black than trading bishops? Probably not, because having bishops on the board can lead to more complications, and Black's goal is to win, so simplifying to a king and pawn endgame where they are up a pawn is better (since it's easier to win). But wait, if White moves the bishop to b6, can Black do anything else? Black's bishop on d6 can now move to other squares, but White's bishop is on b6, which is on a different diagonal, so no immediate attack. But Black is still up a pawn, so they can proceed to push their pawns, but it's not as decisive as the trade.\n\nBut wait, would White choose to move the bishop instead of capturing? Probably not, because capturing the bishop is better for White\u2014if they move the bishop, they still have to deal with Black's bishop (which is active on d6), and Black is still up a pawn. If they capture the bishop, they eliminate Black's bishop (so Black has no pieces except king and pawns), and White has no pieces except king and pawns, but Black is still up a pawn. Which is better for White? Capturing is better, because it reduces the number of pieces, making it harder for Black to create threats (since Black has no bishops to attack with). But even so, Black is still up a pawn, which is enough to win in a king and pawn endgame.\n\nAnother option for White: what if White moves their king to a square that defends the bishop? White's king is on c4. Can the king move to a square that defends the bishop on c7? The king can move one square in any direction. The bishop on c7 is on c7. The king on c4 can move to:\n- c5: no, doesn't defend c7.\n- d4: no.\n- d5: no.\n- c3: no.\n- b4: no.\n- b5: no.\n- d3: no.\n- b3: no.\nNone of these squares are adjacent to c7, so the king can't defend the bishop on c7. So White can't use their king to defend the bishop.\n\nWhat about White's pawns? Can they defend the bishop? White's pawns are on g3 and h2\u2014too far from c7, so no.\n\nSo White's only good option in response to b4d6 is to capture the bishop on d6 with their own bishop on c7 (\u2657c7xd6), leading to a king and pawn endgame where Black is up a pawn. This is a winning position for Black, as they can push their pawns to promotion, and White has no way to stop them (since they have no pieces except king and pawns).\n\nNow, let's confirm that b4d6 is the best move by comparing it to other moves:\n- King moves: passive, no benefit\u2014eliminate.\n- Pawn moves: push pawns, but no immediate threat\u2014eliminate.\n- Other bishop moves: either passive (like moving to f8 or e7) or don't create any threats (like moving to c5 or a5)\u2014eliminate.\n- Only b4d6 creates an immediate threat (attacking White's bishop), forcing White to either lose the bishop (catastrophic) or trade bishops (leading to a winning endgame for Black).\n\nIs there any way that b4d6 could be a bad move? Let's think: after Black moves b4d6, is there any way that White can gain an advantage? For example, can White check Black's king? White's pieces are king on c4, bishop on c7 (or b6, if they move it), pawns on g3 and h2. No, none of these pieces can check Black's king (which is on g8) after b4d6. White's bishop is either on c7 (can't reach g8) or b6 (can't reach g8), pawns are too far, king is too far. So no check.\n\nAnother thing to check: is b4d6 a safe move for Black? After moving the bishop to d6, is the bishop under attack by any White pieces? As we said earlier, White's bishop on c7 can capture it, but that's a trade, which is good for Black. White's king is on c4\u2014can't attack d6 (too far). White's pawns are on g3 and h2\u2014can't attack d6 (too far). So yes, b4d6 is a safe move (except for the trade, which is intentional).\n\nNow, let's summarize why b4d6 is the best move:\n1. It creates an immediate threat: attacking White's bishop on c7.\n2. White has no good way to defend the bishop except to capture Black's bishop, which leads to a trade.\n3. The trade results in a king and pawn endgame where Black is up a pawn, which is a decisive material advantage (enough to win the game).\n4. All other legal moves (king moves, pawn moves, other bishop moves) do not create any immediate threats or improve Black's position as much as b4d6.\n\nTherefore, the best move for Black is b4d6.\n```\nb4d6\n```"
