        "content": "Got it, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to remember the position: it's White's turn, FEN is 8/8/6K1/7P/6P1/1p6/3k4/8 w - - 0 55. So let's visualize the board:\n\nWhite has a king on g8? Wait no, wait FEN ranks go from 8 (top) to 1 (bottom). So 6K1 on rank 3 (since 8 is first, so rank 8: 8, rank7:8, rank6:6K1\u2014wait no, FEN is written as rank 8 to rank 1, each rank is 8 characters (or compressed). Let's decode it properly:\n\nRank 8: 8 (all empty)\nRank 7: 8 (all empty)\nRank 6: 6K1 \u2192 six empty, then K (king) on the 7th file (since files are a-h, 1st character is a-file), wait no: 6K1 means for rank 6, it's 6 empty squares, then a White king (since it's uppercase), then 1 empty square. Wait no, no\u2014wait FEN uses uppercase for White, lowercase for Black. So rank 6: \"6K1\" \u2192 let's count: 6 + 1 +1? No, no, the numbers represent consecutive empty squares. So \"6K1\" is 6 empty, then a piece (K), then 1 empty. So total 6+1+1=8, which is correct for a rank. So rank 6 (third from the top, since rank 8 is top) has White king on... let's see: files are a (1st character) to h (8th). So 6 empty: a to f (6 files), then K on g (7th character), then 1 empty on h (8th character). So White king is on g6.\n\nRank 5: 7P \u2192 7 empty, then P on h-file (since 7+1=8). So White pawn on h5.\n\nRank 4: 6P1 \u2192 6 empty, then P on g-file (since 6+1+1=8? Wait no, 6P1 is 6 empty, then P, then 1 empty: so files a-f (6) empty, P on g (7th character), h (8th) empty. So White pawn on g4.\n\nRank 3: 1p6 \u2192 1 empty (a-file), then p (Black pawn) on b-file (2nd character), then 6 empty (c-h). So Black pawn on b3.\n\nRank 2: 3k4 \u2192 3 empty (a-c), then k (Black king) on d-file (4th character), then 4 empty (e-h). So Black king on d2.\n\nRank 1: 8 (all empty).\n\nSo pieces:\n\nWhite: Kg6, h5 pawn, g4 pawn.\n\nBlack: Kd2, b3 pawn.\n\nIt's White's turn, legal moves are Kh7, Kg7, Kf7, Kh6, Kf6, Kg5, Kf5, h6, g5 (as given).\n\nFirst, let's assess the position. Material is equal: both have a king and two pawns. But the pawn structures are different. White's pawns are on h5 and g4\u2014they are connected passed pawns? Wait no, connected pawns are on adjacent files, which they are (g and h), but passed pawns are pawns that have no enemy pawns in front of them on their file or adjacent files. Black has a pawn on b3, so White's g and h pawns have no Black pawns in their path (since Black's pawn is on b3, which is far away). So White's pawns are connected passed pawns, which is a big advantage. Black's pawn is on b3, which is a passed pawn (since White has no pawns on a, b, c files), but it's a single passed pawn, and White's king is closer to the center than Black's king? Wait no, White's king is on g6 (rank 6), Black's king is on d2 (rank 2). The pawns: White's pawns are on h5 (rank5) and g4 (rank4), so they are advancing up the board. Black's pawn is on b3 (rank3), so it's also advancing, but it's alone.\n\nThe key in king and pawn endgames is king activity and pawn advancement. White has two connected passed pawns, which are very strong because they can support each other. Black has a single passed pawn, which is weaker. So White should be trying to advance their pawns while keeping the king in a position to support them and block Black's pawn.\n\nFirst, let's look at the legal moves. The king moves: Kh7, Kg7, Kf7 (moving up to rank7), Kh6, Kf6 (staying on rank6), Kg5, Kf5 (moving down to rank5). The pawn moves: h6 (advancing h5 to h6) or g5 (advancing g4 to g5).\n\nLet's think about pawn moves first, because advancing passed pawns is usually good. Let's consider g5: moving the g-pawn from g4 to g5. Now White's pawns are on g5 and h5\u2014still connected, and they have advanced one square. What's Black's response? Black's king is on d2, so the closest it can get to White's pawns is... let's see, Black's legal moves after g5: the king can move to c1, c2, c3, d1, d3, e1, e2, e3 (since it's on d2). The pawn on b3 can move to b2 (since it's a pawn, and it's on rank3, so it can move one square forward to b2; it can't capture because there's no piece on a2 or c2). So Black's options are king moves or pawn to b2.\n\nIf White plays g5, Black might try to advance their pawn: b2. Then White's turn: what's the best move? White's pawns are on g5 and h5. The king is on g6. White can advance h6: h5\u2192h6. Then Black's pawn is on b2, which is a threat (it can promote next move to b1=Q). So Black's next move would be b1=Q. Then White has h6, which can promote to h7 next move, but Black has a queen, which is stronger. Wait, but maybe White can checkmate with the queen? No, but let's think step by step. If White plays g5, Black plays b2. White plays h6, Black plays b1=Q. Now White has h6, which can go to h7, then h8=Q. But Black has a queen already, so maybe it's a draw? Or maybe White can win, but it's risky because Black's pawn is closer to promotion (b3\u2192b2\u2192b1 is two moves, while White's h5\u2192h6\u2192h7\u2192h8 is three moves, and g4\u2192g5\u2192g6\u2192g7\u2192g8 is four moves). Wait no, wait the pawns: Black's pawn is on b3 (rank3), so to promote, it needs to go to b2 (rank2), then b1 (rank1)\u2014that's two moves (since pawns move one square forward, except first move, but this pawn is on rank3, so it's already moved, so it can only move one square each time). White's h-pawn is on h5 (rank5), so to promote, it needs to go to h6 (rank6), h7 (rank7), h8 (rank8)\u2014three moves. The g-pawn is on g4 (rank4), so it needs four moves to promote. So Black's pawn is closer to promotion: two moves vs White's three (h-pawn) or four (g-pawn). So if White advances their pawns, Black can promote their pawn faster, which is a problem.\n\nWait, but what if White uses their king to block Black's pawn? The Black pawn is on b3, so the square in front of it is b2, then b1. The White king is on g6. How far is the White king from the Black pawn? Let's calculate the distance using the \"king move\" metric (number of steps the king needs to take to reach a square). The White king is on g6. To get to b3, the king needs to move from g6 to f5 (1), e4 (2), d3 (3), c2 (4), b3 (5). That's five moves. Black's pawn can get to b1 in two moves (b3\u2192b2\u2192b1). So White's king is too far to stop Black's pawn from promoting. So Black's pawn will promote before White's king can reach it.\n\nSo that's a problem. So if White just advances their pawns, Black can promote their pawn first, which gives them a queen, and then White might be in trouble. So White needs a way to either stop Black's pawn from promoting or to promote their own pawns faster than Black.\n\nWait, but wait: White has two connected passed pawns. Connected passed pawns are strong because they can protect each other. For example, if White's pawns are on g5 and h5, then the g-pawn protects the h-pawn (if the h-pawn is attacked, the g-pawn can capture), and vice versa. But in this case, Black's king is on d2, which is far from White's pawns, so the main threat is Black's pawn on b3.\n\nSo what if White doesn't advance the pawns, but moves the king closer to Black's pawn? Let's look at the king moves. The king is on g6. The legal king moves are:\n\n- Up to rank7: Kh7 (g6\u2192h7), Kg7 (g6\u2192g7), Kf7 (g6\u2192f7). These moves take the king further away from Black's pawn (which is on b3, rank3). So that's bad because the king needs to get closer to stop the pawn.\n\n- Stay on rank6: Kh6 (g6\u2192h6), Kf6 (g6\u2192f6). Kh6 is moving to the h-file, which is further from the center; Kf6 is moving to the f-file, which is closer to the center (since Black's pawn is on b3, which is on the b-file, so the center is e-d-c). So Kf6 is better than Kh6 if we want to get closer to Black's pawn.\n\n- Move down to rank5: Kg5 (g6\u2192g5), Kf5 (g6\u2192f5). These are moving the king closer to the center (since rank5 is lower than rank6, and Black's king is on rank2, pawn on rank3). Kf5 is on the f-file, rank5: that's closer to Black's pawn (b3) than Kg5 (g-file, rank5). Let's calculate the distance from Kf5 to b3: f5\u2192e4\u2192d3\u2192c2\u2192b3: four moves (same as before, but starting from f5 instead of g6, so one less move). From Kg5 to b3: g5\u2192f4\u2192e3\u2192d2\u2192c1\u2192b2\u2192b3: six moves? No, wait Kg5 to b3: the shortest path is g5\u2192f4\u2192e3\u2192d2\u2192c1\u2192b2\u2192b3? No, no, the shortest path for a king is the minimum number of steps where each step is one square in any direction. So from g5 (file g, rank5) to b3 (file b, rank3): the difference in files is 5 (g to b is 5 files: g\u2192f\u2192e\u2192d\u2192c\u2192b), difference in ranks is 2 (5 to 3). The shortest path is max(5,2) = 5? No, wait no\u2014wait the king can move diagonally, so the number of steps is the maximum of the horizontal and vertical distances. So from g5 (file 7, rank5) to b3 (file2, rank3): horizontal distance is 7-2=5 (files), vertical distance is 5-3=2 (ranks). So maximum is 5, so 5 steps. From f5 (file6, rank5) to b3 (file2, rank3): horizontal distance 6-2=4, vertical distance 5-3=2: maximum 4 steps. Oh right, I made a mistake earlier. So Kf5 is better than Kg5 because it's closer to Black's pawn.\n\nSo if White plays Kf5 (moving the king from g6 to f5), how many steps does the king need to reach Black's pawn (b3)? Let's see: Kf5\u2192e4 (step1), e4\u2192d3 (step2), d3\u2192c2 (step3), c2\u2192b3 (step4). So four steps. Black's pawn is on b3: to promote, it needs to go to b2 (step1), then b1 (step2). So Black's pawn can promote in two moves, while White's king needs four moves to reach it. So even if White moves the king closer, Black's pawn will promote before the king can stop it.\n\nWait, but what if White advances both pawns quickly so that they can promote before Black's pawn? Let's see: White's pawns are on h5 (rank5) and g4 (rank4). To promote, h5 needs to go to h6 (rank6), h7 (rank7), h8 (rank8): three moves. g4 needs to go to g5 (rank5), g6 (rank6), g7 (rank7), g8 (rank8): four moves. Black's pawn is on b3 (rank3): needs to go to b2 (rank2), b1 (rank1): two moves. So Black's pawn will promote first (in two moves) unless White can stop it. But White's king is too far to stop it, as we saw.\n\nWait, but what if White can promote one of their pawns in two moves? Is that possible? Let's see: the h-pawn is on h5 (rank5). To promote in two moves, it needs to go to h6 (rank6) then h7 (rank7) then h8 (rank8)\u2014no, that's three moves. The g-pawn is on g4 (rank4): to promote in two moves, it needs to go to g5 (rank5) then g6 (rank6) then g7 (rank7) then g8 (rank8)\u2014four moves. So no, White's pawns can't promote faster than Black's pawn.\n\nSo what's the alternative? If White can't stop Black's pawn from promoting, but White has two connected passed pawns, maybe White can promote one of their pawns at the same time or just after Black, and then the game becomes a queen vs queen endgame, which is usually a draw, but maybe with two pawns, White can win? Wait, but let's think about the order.\n\nSuppose White plays h6 (advancing the h-pawn from h5 to h6). That's one move towards promotion. Black's response: they can advance their pawn to b2 (b3\u2192b2). Now White's turn: they can advance g5 (g4\u2192g5). Black's turn: they can promote their pawn to b1=Q. Now White's turn: they can advance h7 (h6\u2192h7). Black's turn: they have a queen, so they can move it to, say, h1, threatening to capture the h-pawn. White's turn: they can advance h8=Q. Now we have a queen vs queen endgame, with White having a g-pawn on g5 and Black having no pawns. Is that a win for White? Maybe, but it's not certain. Queen endgames with a pawn are often wins, but it depends on the position. However, Black's queen is already on the board, so they might be able to defend.\n\nAlternatively, if White plays g5 first (g4\u2192g5), then Black plays b2 (b3\u2192b2), White plays h6 (h5\u2192h6), Black plays b1=Q, White plays h7 (h6\u2192h7), Black plays Qh1 (attacking the h-pawn), White plays h8=Q, Black plays Qxh8, White plays g6 (g5\u2192g6). Now White has a g-pawn on g6, Black has a queen. Is that a win? Unlikely, because the queen can stop the pawn.\n\nWait, but what if White doesn't advance the pawns, but moves the king to a position where it can support the pawns while also being able to block Black's pawn? Wait, but the king is on g6, and Black's pawn is on b3. The king can't be in two places at once. So maybe White has to choose between advancing their pawns (to promote) or moving the king to stop Black's pawn (but it's too far).\n\nWait, let's think about the value of connected passed pawns. In king and pawn endgames, two connected passed pawns are usually worth more than a single passed pawn, especially if they are advanced. Because they can support each other and force the enemy king to split its attention. For example, if White's pawns are on g5 and h5, then when they advance to g6 and h6, the king can't capture either pawn because the other one would promote. So maybe White should advance their pawns as quickly as possible, even if Black promotes their pawn, because the connected passed pawns can become two queens, which would be a win.\n\nWait, let's try a different line. Suppose White plays h6 (h5\u2192h6). Black's best move is to advance their pawn to b2 (b3\u2192b2). Now White plays g5 (g4\u2192g5). Black plays b1=Q. White plays h7 (h6\u2192h7). Black plays Qh1 (attacking the h-pawn). White plays h8=Q. Black plays Qxh8. White plays g6 (g5\u2192g6). Now White has a g-pawn on g6, Black has a queen. Can White win? Probably not, because the queen can easily stop the pawn. For example, Black can play Qg8, blocking the pawn's path. Then White's king is on g6, so they can't move the pawn to g7 because the queen is on g8. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if White plays g5 first (g4\u2192g5), then Black plays b2 (b3\u2192b2), White plays h6 (h5\u2192h6), Black plays b1=Q, White plays h7 (h6\u2192h7), Black plays Qh1, White plays h8=Q, Black plays Qxh8, White plays g6 (g5\u2192g6). Same result.\n\nWait, but what if White plays h6, then g6 instead of g5? Wait no, the g-pawn is on g4, so it can't jump to g6; it can only move one square forward to g5 (since it's not a capture). Oh right, pawns move one square forward (except the first move, but the g-pawn is on g4, which is rank4, so it's already moved once\u2014wait no, wait the pawn's first move can be two squares, but after that, it's one square. So if the g-pawn is on g4, that means it started on g2, moved to g4 (two squares) on its first move, so now it can only move one square forward to g5. So yes, g5 is the only pawn move for the g-pawn.\n\nWait, another thought: what if White moves the king to Kf6 (g6\u2192f6) instead of advancing pawns? Kf6 is on the f-file, rank6. From there, the king can move to e5 (rank5) next move, then d4 (rank4), then c3 (rank3), then b2 (rank2) to stop Black's pawn. Let's calculate: Kf6 (move1), e5 (move2), d4 (move3), c3 (move4), b2 (move5). Black's pawn: b3\u2192b2 (move1), b1=Q (move2). So Black's pawn promotes on move2, while White's king reaches b2 on move5. So that's too late.\n\nWhat if White plays Kg5 (g6\u2192g5) instead of Kf6? Kg5 is on g-file, rank5. Then next move: f4 (rank4), then e3 (rank3), then d2 (rank2), then c1 (rank1), then b2 (rank2). That's even longer: Kg5 (1), f4 (2), e3 (3), d2 (4), c1 (5), b2 (6). So even worse.\n\nWait, what if White plays Kh6 (g6\u2192h6)? That's moving the king to the h-file, which is further from Black's pawn. So that's not helpful.\n\nSo all king moves that move the king closer to Black's pawn are too slow to stop the pawn from promoting. So White has to rely on their own pawns to promote before or at the same time as Black's pawn.\n\nWait, but what if White advances both pawns in one move? No, they can only move one piece per turn. So they have to choose between advancing h6 or g5 first.\n\nLet's think about the pawn structure again. White's pawns are on g4 and h5. If they advance g5 to g5, then the pawns are on g5 and h5\u2014connected, and they control the f6 and f5 squares? No, pawns attack diagonally. The g5 pawn attacks f6 and h6; the h5 pawn attacks g6 and f6. So they control f6 and h6. The king is on g6, which is attacked by the h5 pawn? No, no\u2014pawns can't attack their own king. Wait, no, the h5 pawn is White's, so it's on h5, and the king is on g6: the pawn is on the h-file, rank5; the king is on g-file, rank6. The pawn attacks diagonally forward, so the h5 pawn attacks g6 (which is where the king is) and f6. Oh! Wait a minute! The White king is on g6, and the White pawn is on h5. The pawn on h5 attacks g6, which is the king's square. But in chess, a king can't be in check by its own piece. Wait, no\u2014wait, no, the pawn is White's, so it's not attacking the White king. Because pieces of the same color don't attack each other. Oh right! I forgot that. So the h5 pawn is White's, so it doesn't threaten the White king on g6. Phew, that's a relief. So that's not a problem.\n\nSo back to pawn moves. Let's consider h6 (h5\u2192h6). What's the advantage of moving the h-pawn first? The h-pawn is on h5, so moving it to h6 puts it one step closer to promotion. The g-pawn is on g4, so moving it to g5 puts it one step closer. Which one is better?\n\nIn connected passed pawns, it's usually better to advance the front pawn first? Wait no, wait the h-pawn is on h5 (rank5), which is ahead of the g-pawn on g4 (rank4). So the h-pawn is the front pawn (since it's on a higher rank). So advancing the front pawn (h6) first would mean that the pawns are on h6 and g4\u2014no, wait no, if you advance the front pawn, you have h6 and g4, which are not connected (since they are on different ranks). Wait no, connected passed pawns are on adjacent files, regardless of rank. So h6 and g4 are still connected (since they are on h and g files), but they are not on the same rank. The advantage of connected passed pawns is that they can protect each other: if the enemy king attacks one pawn, the other can capture it. For example, if the king is on f6, attacking the g5 pawn, the h5 pawn can capture it (if it's on h5). So if the pawns are on the same rank, they can protect each other. If they are on different ranks, the front pawn can't be protected by the back pawn, but the back pawn can be protected by the front pawn. Wait, no\u2014if the pawns are on h6 and g5 (same rank), then the g5 pawn protects the h6 pawn (since it's on the adjacent file, and pawns attack diagonally forward). Wait no, pawns attack diagonally forward, so a pawn on g5 attacks f6 and h6. So if there's a pawn on h6, the g5 pawn doesn't protect it\u2014because the h6 pawn is on the same rank as the g5 pawn's attack squares. Wait, no, let's take an example: a White pawn on g5 (file g, rank5) attacks squares f6 (file f, rank6) and h6 (file h, rank6). So if there's a White pawn on h6 (file h, rank6), then the g5 pawn is attacking the square where the h6 pawn is, but since it's a White pawn, that's not a threat. So the g5 pawn doesn't protect the h6 pawn. However, if there's a Black king on h6, the g5 pawn can capture it (if it's White's turn). So the protection works when the enemy piece is on the square attacked by the pawn. So for connected passed pawns, being on the same rank is better because they can both attack the same squares in front of them, making it harder for the enemy king to approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what happens if White plays h6 (h5\u2192h6). Black's best move is b2 (b3\u2192b2). Then White plays g5 (g4\u2192g5). Now White's pawns are on h6 and g5 (same rank, adjacent files\u2014connected passed pawns). Black's pawn is on b2, which will promote next move to b1=Q. So White's next move is h7 (h6\u2192h7). Black's move is b1=Q. White's move is h8=Q. Now we have a queen vs queen endgame, with White having a g-pawn on g5 and Black having no pawns. Is this a win for White? Let's see: White's queen is on h8, g-pawn on g5. Black's queen is on b1. White can move the queen to g7, then g6, then g5 to support the pawn. Black's queen can try to block, but with the king's help, White might be able to promote the g-pawn. But it's not certain.\n\nAlternatively, if White plays g5 first (g4\u2192g5), then Black plays b2 (b3\u2192b2), White plays h6 (h5\u2192h6), Black plays b1=Q, White plays h7 (h6\u2192h7), Black plays Qh1, White plays h8=Q, Black plays Qxh8, White plays g6 (g5\u2192g6). Now White has a g-pawn on g6, Black has a queen. As before, the queen can stop the pawn.\n\nWait, but what if White doesn't advance the pawns at all, but just moves the king around? That's not helpful because Black will just advance their pawn and promote. So White has to do something.\n\nWait, let's think about the king's position relative to the pawns. White's king is on g6, which is behind the h-pawn (h5) and the g-pawn (g4). So the king is in a position to support the pawns as they advance. For example, if the pawns advance to h6 and g5, the king can move to g6 (wait, it's already there) or f6 to support them. If the pawns advance to h7 and g6, the king can move to g7 to support them. So maybe advancing the pawns while keeping the king close is the way to go.\n\nLet's consider the move h6 (h5\u2192h6). After that, Black plays b2 (b3\u2192b2). White plays g5 (g4\u2192g5). Now White's pawns are on h6 and g5, king on g6. Black's pawn is on b2. White's next move: they can advance h7 (h6\u2192h7). Black's next move: b1=Q. White's next move: h8=Q. Now we have Qh8 vs Qb1, with White having a g-pawn on g5. White can play Qg7, then Qg6, then Qg5 to protect the g-pawn. Black's queen can try to attack the g-pawn, but White's queen can defend it. For example, Black plays Qg1, attacking the g-pawn. White plays Qg5, defending it. Then Black has to move the queen, and White can advance the g-pawn to g6. Then Black plays Qg2, attacking the g-pawn. White plays Qg6, defending it. Then White advances g7, and so on. Eventually, White might be able to promote the g-pawn, resulting in two queens vs one, which is a win.\n\nAlternatively, if White plays g5 first (g4\u2192g5), then Black plays b2 (b3\u2192b2), White plays h6 (h5\u2192h6), Black plays b1=Q, White plays h7 (h6\u2192h7), Black plays Qh1, White plays h8=Q, Black plays Qxh8, White plays g6 (g5\u2192g6). Now White has a g-pawn on g6, Black has a queen. White's king is on g6 (wait no, after g5, the king is still on g6? Wait no, when White plays g5 (g4\u2192g5), that's a pawn move, so the king stays on g6. Then Black plays b2 (b3\u2192b2), White plays h6 (h5\u2192h6)\u2014king still on g6. Black plays b1=Q\u2014king on g6. White plays h7 (h6\u2192h7)\u2014king on g6. Black plays Qh1\u2014king on g6. White plays h8=Q\u2014king on g6. Black plays Qxh8\u2014king on g6. White plays g6 (g5\u2192g6)\u2014king on g6. Now White's king is on g6, g-pawn on g6? No, wait no\u2014pawns can't be on the same square as the king. Oh right! I made a mistake here. If White's king is on g6, then the g-pawn can't move to g6 because the king is there. Oh my goodness, that's a critical mistake. So when I thought White could play g6 after h8=Q, that's impossible because the king is on g6. So that changes things.\n\nOh wow, that's a big mistake. So let's correct that. Let's take the line where White plays g5 (g4\u2192g5) first. So:\n\n1. White: g5 (g4\u2192g5) \u2192 pawn on g5, king on g6.\n2. Black: b2 (b3\u2192b2) \u2192 pawn on b2, king on d2.\n3. White: h6 (h5\u2192h6) \u2192 pawn on h6, king on g6.\n4. Black: b1=Q (b2\u2192b1=Q) \u2192 queen on b1, king on d2.\n5. White: h7 (h6\u2192h7) \u2192 pawn on h7, king on g6.\n6. Black: Qh1 (queen from b1 to h1) \u2192 attacking the h7 pawn.\n7. White: h8=Q (h7\u2192h8=Q) \u2192 queen on h8, king on g6.\n8. Black: Qxh8 (queen from h1 to h8, capturing White's queen) \u2192 queen on h8, king on d2.\n9. White's turn: what's the legal moves? The king is on g6, pawn on g5. The legal king moves are Kh7, Kg7, Kf7, Kh6, Kf6, Kg5, Kf5 (same as before, but now the pawn is on g5, so the king can't move to g5 because the pawn is there). The pawn on g5 can move to g6, but the king is on g6, so that's illegal. So the only legal moves are king moves.\n\nAh! So that's a problem. Because after White plays h8=Q and Black captures it with Qxh8, White's pawn is on g5, and the king is on g6. So the pawn can't move to g6 (because the king is there), and the king can't move to g5 (because the pawn is there). So White's only moves are king moves: Kh7, Kg7, Kf7, Kh6, Kf6, Kf5.\n\nSo what's the best king move here? Let's say White plays Kf6 (g6\u2192f6). Now the king is on f6, pawn on g5. Black's queen is on h8. Black can move the queen to g8, attacking the g5 pawn. White's king is on f6, so it can't defend the g5 pawn. Black can capture the g5 pawn with Qxg5. Now White has no pawns, Black has a queen. That's a loss for White.\n\nOh, so that's even worse. So that line is bad because White loses the g-pawn after the queen exchange.\n\nWhat if in step 6, Black doesn't play Qh1, but plays something else? For example, after White plays h7 (step5), Black could play Qg2 instead of Qh1. Let's see:\n\n5. White: h7 (h6\u2192h7) \u2192 pawn on h7, king on g6.\n6. Black: Qg2 (queen from b1 to g2) \u2192 attacking the g5 pawn.\n7. White: h8=Q (h7\u2192h8=Q) \u2192 queen on h8, king on g6.\n8. Black: Qxg5 (queen from g2 to g5, capturing the pawn) \u2192 queen on g5, king on d2.\n9. White: Qxg5 (queen from h8 to g5, capturing Black's queen) \u2192 queen on g5, king on g6.\n10. Black's turn: they have no pawns, king on d2. White has a queen, king on g6. That's a win for White, because queen vs king is a win.\n\nWait, that's a better line for White! Because if Black plays Qg2 instead of Qh1, White can capture the queen and win. But why would Black play Qg2? Because Qh1 is a better move, right? Because Qh1 attacks the h7 pawn, which is about to promote, while Qg2 attacks the g5 pawn, which is not promoting yet. So Black would choose Qh1 to prevent White from promoting the h-pawn, but wait no\u2014White has already promoted the h-pawn to h8=Q in step7. Wait no, step5 is White playing h7 (h6\u2192h7), so the pawn is on h7, which is one step away from promotion. Step6 is Black's turn: they have a queen on b1. So Black's options are to move the queen to a square where it can attack the h7 pawn (which is about to promote to h8=Q). The squares that attack h7 are: g8, f7, e6, d5, c4, b3, a2 (diagonally), and h8 (straight), but h8 is empty. Wait no, the queen can move in any direction, so from b1, the queen can move to h7 in one move (since it's a diagonal move: b1 to h7 is 6 squares diagonally, which is allowed for a queen). Oh right! I forgot that the queen can move any number of squares in any direction. So from b1, the queen can move directly to h7 (b1\u2192h7) in one move, capturing the h7 pawn. Oh my goodness, that's a huge mistake. I can't believe I forgot that.\n\nSo let's correct that line properly. Let's take the same starting point: White plays g5 (g4\u2192g5) first.\n\n1. White: g5 (g4\u2192g5) \u2192 pawns on g5 (g-file, rank5), h5 (h-file, rank5)? No, wait no\u2014wait the original position has White's pawns on h5 (rank5) and g4 (rank4). So when White plays g5, the g-pawn moves from g4 to g5 (rank5), so now White's pawns are on g5 (rank5) and h5 (rank5)\u2014connected passed pawns on the same rank (rank5). Oh! I made a mistake earlier: the original g-pawn is on g4 (rank4), so moving it to g5 (rank5) puts it on the same rank as the h-pawn (h5, rank5). That's a big difference! Because now the pawns are on the same rank (rank5) and adjacent files (g and h), so they are connected passed pawns on the same rank, which is very strong because they can protect each other.\n\nOh my God, I can't believe I messed up the original pawn positions. The FEN is 6P1 on rank4: that's 6 empty, then P, then 1 empty. So rank4 (which is the 4th rank from the top, so the 5th rank from the bottom) has a White pawn on g4? Wait no, wait no\u2014FEN ranks are written from rank 8 (top) to rank 1 (bottom). So:\n\n- Rank 8: 8 \u2192 all empty (top rank).\n- Rank 7: 8 \u2192 all empty (second from top).\n- Rank 6: 6K1 \u2192 6 empty, then K (White king) on the 7th character (since 6+1+1=8), which is the g-file (since a-file is 1st character, b=2nd, ..., g=7th, h=8th). So White king is on g6 (file g, rank6).\n- Rank 5: 7P \u2192 7 empty, then P (White pawn) on the 8th character, which is h-file. So White pawn on h5 (file h, rank5).\n- Rank 4: 6P1 \u2192 6 empty, then P (White pawn) on the 7th character (g-file), then 1 empty (h-file). So White pawn on g4 (file g, rank4).\n- Rank 3: 1p6 \u2192 1 empty (a-file), then p (Black pawn) on 2nd character (b-file), then 6 empty. So Black pawn on b3 (file b, rank3).\n- Rank 2: 3k4 \u2192 3 empty (a-c files), then k (Black king) on 4th character (d-file), then 4 empty. So Black king on d2 (file d, rank2).\n- Rank 1: 8 \u2192 all empty (bottom rank).\n\nOh! So I had the pawns wrong earlier. The White pawn on rank5 is h5 (h-file, rank5), and the White pawn on rank4 is g4 (g-file, rank4). So they are not on the same rank. The h-pawn is on rank5 (one rank higher than the g-pawn on rank4). So they are connected passed pawns (since they are on adjacent files) but the h-pawn is ahead of the g-pawn.\n\nThat changes things. So when White plays g5 (g4\u2192g5), the g-pawn moves from rank4 to rank5, so now both pawns are on rank5: g5 (g-file, rank5) and h5 (h-file, rank5). Ah! That's a big difference. So now they are connected passed pawns on the same rank, which is much stronger because they can support each other. For example, if the Black king tries to capture the g5 pawn, the h5 pawn can capture it (if it's on f5), and vice versa.\n\nOh my goodness, I can't believe I made that mistake earlier. That's critical. So let's start over with the correct pawn positions.\n\nCorrect position:\n\n- White: Kg6 (g-file, rank6), Pawn h5 (h-file, rank5), Pawn g4 (g-file, rank4).\n- Black: Kd2 (d-file, rank2), Pawn b3 (b-file, rank3).\n- It's White's turn.\n- Legal moves: Kh7, Kg7, Kf7 (king moves up to rank7), Kh6, Kf6 (king moves left/right on rank6), Kg5, Kf5 (king moves down to rank5), h6 (pawn h5\u2192h6, rank6), g5 (pawn g4\u2192g5, rank5).\n\nAh! So the pawn g4 is on rank4, so moving it to g5 (rank5) is a valid move (since pawns move one square forward, and it's not a capture). And after that, the pawns are on g5 (rank5) and h5 (rank5)\u2014same rank, adjacent files: connected passed pawns on the same rank. That's a huge advantage because they can't be captured by the enemy king without being captured back. For example, if the Black king is on f5, attacking the g5 pawn, the h5 pawn can capture it (since it's on h5, and the king is on f5\u2014wait no, the h5 pawn is on h-file, rank5, so it attacks g6 and f6 (diagonally forward). So if the Black king is on f5, the h5 pawn can't capture it because it's on a square that the pawn doesn't attack. Wait, no\u2014pawns attack diagonally forward, so a White pawn on h5 (rank5) attacks squares g6 (rank6, g-file) and f7 (rank7, f-file)? No, wait no\u2014rank numbers go from 1 (bottom) to 8 (top). So a pawn on rank5 (which is the 5th rank from the bottom, so the 4th rank from the top) moves forward to rank6 (towards rank8). So a White pawn on h5 (h-file, rank5) attacks squares g6 (g-file, rank6) and f7 (f-file, rank7)? No, no\u2014wait no, the direction is important. White pawns move up the board (from rank1 to rank8), so a White pawn on rank5 attacks the squares diagonally in front of it, which are rank6. So a White pawn on h5 (h-file, rank5) attacks g6 (g-file, rank6) and... wait, no\u2014h-file is the 8th file, so the only diagonal square in front of it is g6 (since there's no i-file). Oh right! I forgot that the h-file is the last file, so a pawn on h5 can only attack g6 (since it's on the h-file, there's no square to the right of it). So a White pawn on h5 (h-file, rank5) attacks g6 (g-file, rank6). A White pawn on g5 (g-file, rank5) attacks f6 (f-file, rank6) and h6 (h-file, rank6). Ah! So that's an important point.\n\nSo if White's pawns are on g5 (g-file, rank5) and h5 (h-file, rank5), then:\n\n- The g5 pawn attacks f6 and h6 (rank6).\n- The h5 pawn attacks g6 (rank6).\n\nSo together, they control the squares f6, g6, h6 (rank6). That's a solid block of squares, which makes it hard for the Black king to approach the pawns, because if the king moves to any of those squares, it will be captured by a pawn.\n\nAh! That's a key advantage. Because the Black king is on d2 (rank2), which is far from the pawns, but if it tries to move towards the pawns, it has to go through ranks 3, 4, 5, 6. But the pawns on g5 and h5 control rank6 (f6, g6, h6), so the Black king can't move to rank6 without being captured. So the Black king is stuck on ranks 1-5 if it wants to approach the pawns, but the pawns are on rank5, so the king can't move to rank5 either (since the pawns are there). Wait no, the Black king is on d2 (rank2). To get to the pawns on rank5, it has to move up to rank3, then rank4, then rank5. But the pawns are on rank5 (g5 and h5), so the Black king can't move to g5 or h5 (since the pawns are there), but it can move to f5, e5, d5, c5, b5, a5 (rank5). But if the Black king moves to f5 (rank5), the g5 pawn can capture it (since the g5 pawn is on g-file, rank5, and it attacks f6 (rank6) and h6 (rank6)\u2014wait no, no! The g5 pawn is on rank5, so it attacks rank6, not rank5. Oh right! I made a mistake again. Pawns attack the squares diagonally in front of them, which are the next rank. So a pawn on rank5 attacks rank6, not rank5. So the Black king can move to f5 (rank5) without being attacked by the g5 pawn, because the g5 pawn is on rank5 and attacks rank6. Oh my goodness, I'm so embarrassed. I need to get this straight.\n\nLet's take a step back and remember the basic rules of pawn movement and attack:\n\n- **White pawns** move forward (up the board) from rank1 to rank8.\n- A pawn on **rank N** can move to **rank N+1** (one square forward) if that square is empty.\n- A pawn on **rank 2** (its starting rank) can move to **rank 3** or **rank 4** (two squares forward) if both squares are empty.\n- A pawn **attacks** the squares diagonally in front of it, which are **rank N+1**, **file F-1** and **file F+1** (if those files exist).\n- A pawn can only capture an enemy piece that is on one of the squares it attacks.\n\nSo let's apply this to the White pawns in the current position:\n\n1. **Pawn on h5** (White, h-file, rank5):\n   - Moves forward to h6 (rank6) if empty.\n   - Attacks the square diagonally in front of it: g6 (g-file, rank6) (since it's on the h-file, there's no square to the right of it).\n   - Can capture an enemy piece on g6.\n\n2. **Pawn on g4** (White, g-file, rank4):\n   - Moves forward to g5 (rank5) if empty (this is a legal move, as given in the legal moves).\n   - Since it's on rank4 (not its starting rank, which is rank2), it can't move two squares forward.\n   - Attacks the squares diagonally in front of it: f5 (f-file, rank5) and h5 (h-file, rank5).\n   - Can capture an enemy piece on f5 or h5.\n\nAh! So that's the correct information. I can't believe I messed up the attack squares earlier. That's a critical mistake. So let's correct everything with this accurate information.\n\nFirst, let's re-express the current position with correct pawn attack squares:\n\n- **White**:\n  - King: Kg6 (g-file, rank6) \u2192 this square is attacked by the White pawn on h5 (since h5 attacks g6). Wait no! No\u2014pawns don't attack their own pieces. Oh right! I forgot that. Pieces of the same color don't attack each other. So the White pawn on h5 (h-file, rank5) attacks g6 (g-file, rank6), but since the White king is on g6, that's not a threat. It's just a square that the pawn controls (meaning an enemy piece can't move there without being captured).\n\n  - Pawn: h5 (h-file, rank5) \u2192 controls g6 (g-file, rank6) (enemy pieces can't move to g6 without being captured by h5).\n  - Pawn: g4 (g-file, rank4) \u2192 controls f5 (f-file, rank5) and h5 (h-file, rank5) (enemy pieces can't move to f5 or h5 without being captured by g4).\n\n- **Black**:\n  - King: Kd2 (d-file, rank2) \u2192 no threats from White pieces (since White's pawns are on rank4 and 5, and the king is on rank6).\n  - Pawn: b3 (b-file, rank3) \u2192 controls a4 (a-file, rank4) and c4 (c-file, rank4) (enemy pieces can't move to a4 or c4 without being captured by b3).\n\nNow, the legal moves for White are:\n\n- **King moves**: The king is on g6 (g-file, rank6). The king can move one square in any direction, as long as it doesn't move into check and the square is not occupied by a friendly piece.\n  - Up (to rank7): Kh7 (h-file, rank7), Kg7 (g-file, rank7), Kf7 (f-file, rank7) \u2192 all legal (no friendly pieces there, no check).\n  - Left/right (on rank6): Kh6 (h-file, rank6), Kf6 (f-file, rank6) \u2192 legal (no friendly pieces, no check).\n  - Down (to rank5): Kg5 (g-file, rank5) \u2192 but there's a friendly pawn on g4 (rank4), so the square g5 (rank5) is empty? Wait no\u2014wait the pawn is on g4 (rank4), so the square g5 (rank5) is empty. Oh right! The pawn is on g4 (rank4), so the square g5 (rank5) is empty. So the king can move to g5 (rank5) \u2192 legal.\n  - Down-left (to rank5): Kf5 (f-file, rank5) \u2192 empty square, legal.\n  - Down-right (to rank5): Kh5 (h-file, rank5) \u2192 but there's a friendly pawn on h5 (rank5), so that's illegal (can't move to a square occupied by a friendly piece).\n\n  So the legal king moves are: Kh7, Kg7, Kf7, Kh6, Kf6, Kg5, Kf5 (as given in the problem statement).\n\n- **Pawn moves**:\n  - Pawn on h5 (h-file, rank5): can move forward to h6 (h-file, rank6) (since it's on rank5, not starting rank, so one square forward). The square h6 is empty, so legal.\n  - Pawn on g4 (g-file, rank4): can move forward to g5 (g-file, rank5) (since it's on rank4, not starting rank, so one square forward). The square g5 is empty, so legal.\n\n  So the legal pawn moves are h6 and g5 (as given in the problem statement).\n\nGreat, now we have the correct position with correct legal moves and pawn attacks.\n\nNow, let's re-assess the position with this accurate information.\n\n**Material**: Equal (White: K + 2P; Black: K + 2P).  \n**Pawn Structure**:\n- **White**: Pawns on h5 (rank5) and g4 (rank4). These are **connected passed pawns** (connected: adjacent files; passed: no Black pawns on their files (g, h) or adjacent files (f, i\u2014but i doesn't exist) in front of them). The h-pawn is ahead of the g-pawn (rank5 vs rank4).\n- **Black**: Pawn on b3 (rank3). This is a **passed pawn** (no White pawns on its file (b) or adjacent files (a, c) in front of it).\n\n**King Activity**:\n- **White**: King on g6 (rank6) \u2192 close to its pawns (h5 on rank5, g4 on rank4) and can support them as they advance.\n- **Black**: King on d2 (rank2) \u2192 far from White's pawns (rank5, 4) but close to its own pawn (b3 on rank3).\n\n**Key Threats**:\n- **White**: Advance its connected passed pawns to promotion (h5\u2192h6\u2192h7\u2192h8=Q; g4\u2192g5\u2192g6\u2192g7\u2192g8=Q).\n- **Black**: Advance its passed pawn to promotion (b3\u2192b2\u2192b1=Q).\n\n**Critical Observations**:\n1. **White's Connected Passed Pawns**: These are a major advantage because they can support each other and control squares in front of them, making it hard for the Black king to approach. For example, if White advances the g-pawn to g5 (rank5), the pawns will be on h5 (rank5) and g5 (rank5), and they will control the squares f6 (g5 pawn attacks f6), g6 (h5 pawn attacks g6), h6 (g5 pawn attacks h6) \u2192 this blocks the Black king from moving to rank6 (since those squares are controlled by White's pawns).\n2. **Black's Passed Pawn**:\u867d\u7136\u662f\u901a\u8def\u5175\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u662f\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\uff0c\u4e14White\u7684\u738b\u79bb\u5b83\u8f83\u8fdc\uff0c\u4f46Black\u7684\u738b\u79bb\u5b83\u5f88\u8fd1\uff08d2\u2192b3\u53ea\u97003\u6b65\uff1ad2\u2192c3\u2192b3\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5Black\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u738b\u652f\u6301\u5b83\u524d\u8fdb\u3002\n3. **King Position**: White's king is on g6 (rank6), which is behind its pawns (h5 on rank5, g4 on rank4). This is a good position because the king can \"push\" the pawns forward (e.g., if the pawns advance to h6 and g5, the king can move to g6\u2192f6\u2192e6 to support them).\n\nNow, let's analyze the candidate moves (as given in the problem statement: king moves and pawn moves).\n\n### Candidate Move 1: h6 (Pawn h5\u2192h6)\nThis moves the h-pawn from rank5 to rank6. Let's see what happens:\n\n- **After 1. h6**:\n  - White: Kg6, Pawn h6 (rank6), Pawn g4 (rank4).\n  - Black: Kd2, Pawn b3 (rank3).\n  - **White's Threat**: h6\u2192h7\u2192h8=Q (two more moves to promotion).\n  - **Black's Options**: Black's best move is to advance its pawn to b2 (b3\u2192b2) to start its promotion process.\n\n- **1. h6 b2**:\n  - White: Kg6, Pawn h6 (rank6), Pawn g4 (rank4).\n  - Black: Kd2, Pawn b2 (rank2).\n  - **White's Threat**: h6\u2192h7\u2192h8=Q (two moves).\n  - **Black's Threat**: b2\u2192b1=Q (one move).\n  - **White's Next Move**: White must advance its pawns to promotion before Black's pawn. The best move is to advance the g-pawn to g5 (g4\u2192g5) to get it closer to promotion.\n\n- **2. g5 b1=Q**:\n  - White: Kg6, Pawn h6 (rank6), Pawn g5 (rank5).\n  - Black: Kd2, Queen b1.\n  - **White's Threat**: h6\u2192h7\u2192h8=Q (two moves); g5\u2192g6\u2192g7\u2192g8=Q (three moves).\n  - **Black's Threat**: Queen can attack White's pawns or king.\n  - **White's Next Move**: Advance the h-pawn to h7 (h6\u2192h7) to get one step closer to promotion.\n\n- **3. h7 Qh1**:\n  - White: Kg6, Pawn h7 (rank7), Pawn g5 (rank5).\n  - Black: Kd2, Queen h1 (attacking the h7 pawn).\n  - **White's Next Move**: Promote the h-pawn to h8=Q (h7\u2192h8=Q) to counter Black's queen.\n\n- **4. h8=Q Qxh8**:\n  - White: Kg6, Pawn g5 (rank5), Queen captured (now has no queen).\n  - Black: Kd2, Queen h8.\n  - **White's Position**: White has a pawn on g5 (rank5) and a king on g6 (rank6). The pawn can't move to g6 (since the king is there), and the king can't move to g5 (since the pawn is there). White's only moves are king moves (Kh7, Kg7, Kf7, Kh6, Kf6, Kf5).\n  - **Black's Advantage**: Black has a queen, which is a major material advantage. Black can use the queen to attack White's pawn and king, and eventually win the game.\n\n**Conclusion for h6**: This line results in White losing its queen and being at a material disadvantage. Not a good move.\n\n### Candidate Move 2: g5 (Pawn g4\u2192g5)\nThis moves the g-pawn from rank4 to rank5. Now, White's pawns are on h5 (rank5) and g5 (rank5) \u2192 connected passed pawns on the same rank. Let's analyze this line:\n\n- **After 1. g5**:\n  - White: Kg6, Pawn h5 (rank5), Pawn g5 (rank5).\n  - Black: Kd2, Pawn b3 (rank3).\n  - **White's Threat**: Advance pawns to h6 and g6 (rank6), which will control squares f6, g6, h6 (blocking Black's king from rank6).\n  - **Black's Options**: Black's best move is to advance its pawn to b2 (b3\u2192b2) to start its promotion process.\n\n- **1. g5 b2**:\n  - White: Kg6, Pawn h5 (rank5), Pawn g5 (rank5).\n  - Black: Kd2, Pawn b2 (rank2).\n  - **White's Threat**: h5\u2192h6, g5\u2192g6 (rank6) \u2192 control rank6.\n  - **Black's Threat**: b2\u2192b1=Q (one move).\n  - **White's Next Move**: Advance the h-pawn to h6 (h5\u2192h6) to control g6 (rank6) (since the h5 pawn attacks g6).\n\n- **2. h6 b1=Q**:\n  - White: Kg6, Pawn h6 (rank6), Pawn g5 (rank5).\n  - Black: Kd2, Queen b1.\n  - **White's Threat**: h6\u2192h7\u2192h8=Q (two moves); g5\u2192g6\u2192g7\u2192g8=Q (three moves).\n  - **Black's Threat**: Queen can attack White's pawns or king.\n  - **White's Next Move**: Advance the g-pawn to g6 (g5\u2192g6) to control f6 and h6 (rank6) (since the g5 pawn attacks f6 and h6).\n\n- **3. g6 Qg1**:\n  - White: Kg6, Pawn h6 (rank6), Pawn g6 (rank6).\n  - Black: Kd2, Queen g1 (attacking the g6 pawn).\n  - **White's Advantage**: White's pawns are on h6 and g6 (rank6), which are connected passed pawns on the same rank. They control the squares f7 (g6 pawn attacks f7), g7 (h6 pawn attacks g7), h7 (g6 pawn attacks h7) \u2192 this blocks the Black king from moving to rank7 (since those squares are controlled by White's pawns).\n  - **White's Threat**: h6\u2192h7\u2192h8=Q (two moves); g6\u2192g7\u2192g8=Q (two moves).\n  - **Black's Problem**: Black's queen is on g1, and it can't stop both pawns from promoting. For example, if Black plays Qg7 to block the g6 pawn, White can play h7 (h6\u2192h7) and then h8=Q. If Black plays Qh2 to block the h6 pawn, White can play g7 (g6\u2192g7) and then g8=Q.\n\n- **4. White: h7 (or g7)**:\n  - If White plays h7 (h6\u2192h7), then Black has to play Qh2 to block the h7 pawn, but White can play g7 (g6\u2192g7) next move, and then g8=Q.\n  - If White plays g7 (g6\u2192g7), then Black has to play Qg2 to block the g7 pawn, but White can play h7 (h6\u2192h7) next move, and then h8=Q.\n\n**Conclusion for g5**: This line results in White's pawns advancing to rank6 (h6 and g6) and then to rank7 (h7 and g7), which are connected passed pawns that can't be stopped by Black's queen. White will promote both pawns to queens, resulting in a decisive material advantage and a win.\n\n### Candidate Move 3: King Moves (Kh7, Kg7, Kf7, Kh6, Kf6, Kg5, Kf5)\nLet's analyze the best king move, which is Kf5 (moving the king from g6 to f5). This move brings the king closer to Black's pawn (b3) and to the center of the board.\n\n- **After 1. Kf5**:\n  - White: Kf5 (f-file, rank5), Pawn h5 (rank5), Pawn g4 (rank4).\n  - Black: Kd2 (d-file, rank2), Pawn b3 (rank3).\n  - **Black's Options**: Black's best move is to advance its pawn to b2 (b3\u2192b2) to start its promotion process.\n\n- **1. Kf5 b2**:\n  - White: Kf5, Pawn h5, Pawn g4.\n  - Black: Kd2, Pawn b2.\n  - **White's Next Move**: White can try to move the king closer to Black's pawn (b2) by playing Ke4 (f5\u2192e4).\n\n- **2. Ke4 b1=Q**:\n  - White: Ke4, Pawn h5, Pawn g4.\n  - Black: Kd2, Queen b1.\n  - **White's Position**: White has two pawns and a king, but Black has a queen. Black can use the queen to attack White's pawns and king, and eventually win the game.\n\n**Conclusion for King Moves**: All king moves result in Black's pawn promoting to a queen, giving Black a material advantage. White can't stop Black's pawn from promoting because the king is too far away.\n\n### Final Analysis\nThe best move for White is **g5** (Pawn g4\u2192g5). This move advances White's g-pawn to rank5, making White's pawns connected passed pawns on the same rank (h5 and g5). These pawns control the squares f6, g6, h6 (rank6), which blocks the Black king from approaching. Black's only viable response is to advance its pawn to b2 (b3\u2192b2) and then promote it to a queen (b1=Q). However, White can advance its pawns to h6 and g6 (rank6), which are connected passed pawns that can't be stopped by Black's queen. White will eventually promote both pawns to queens, resulting in a decisive win.\n\nOther moves (h6 or king moves) result in White being at a material disadvantage or losing the game. Therefore, **g5** is the best move for White.\n```\ng5\n```"
