        "content": "Got it, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to remember the position: it's White to move, FEN is 8/8/8/1K5p/1P4k1/8/8/8 w - - 1 52. Let's visualize that: White has a king on b5 and a pawn on b4; Black has a king on f3 and a pawn on g5. Wait, no, wait\u2014FEN ranks are from 8 (top) to 1 (bottom), so rank 4 (since it's 1K5p) is the fourth rank from the top, which is the fifth rank from the bottom (since 8-4+1=5). Wait, maybe better to list the pieces by rank:\n\n- Rank 8 (top): empty\n- Rank 7: empty\n- Rank 6: empty\n- Rank 5: 1K5p \u2192 so file b is White king (K), file h is Black pawn (p) \u2192 so White king on b5, Black pawn on g5? Wait no, FEN strings are per rank, from rank 8 to rank 1, each rank is files a to h. So \"1K5p\" on rank 5 (since the FEN is 8/8/8/1K5p/1P4k1/... wait no, wait the FEN is \"8/8/8/1K5p/1P4k1/8/8/8\"\u2014let's split by slashes:\n\n1. Rank 8: 8 \u2192 empty\n2. Rank 7: 8 \u2192 empty\n3. Rank 6: 8 \u2192 empty\n4. Rank 5: 1K5p \u2192 let's expand: 1 (empty) + K + 5 (empty) + p \u2192 so files: a=empty, b=K (White king on b5), c-g=empty, h=p (Black pawn on h5)\n5. Rank 4: 1P4k1 \u2192 expand: 1 + P + 4 + k +1 \u2192 files: a=empty, b=P (White pawn on b4), c-f=empty, g=k (Black king on g4), h=empty\n6. Rank 3: 8 \u2192 empty\n7. Rank 2: 8 \u2192 empty\n8. Rank 1: 8 \u2192 empty\n\nAh, that's better. So White's pieces: King on b5 (Kb5), Pawn on b4 (Pb4). Black's pieces: King on g4 (Kg4), Pawn on h5 (Ph5). It's White's turn, legal moves are Kc6, Kb6, Ka6, Kc5, Ka5, Kc4, Ka4 (so the White king can move to those squares\u2014let's confirm: Kb5 can move one square in any direction, but can't move into check. Black's king is on g4, so the squares attacked by Black king are f3, f4, f5, g3, g5, h3, h4, h5. White's king is on b5, which is not in those squares, so no check. Can White king move to adjacent squares? Let's list all adjacent squares to b5: a4, a5, a6, b4, b6, c4, c5, c6. Now, are any of these squares occupied? b4 is occupied by White's pawn (Pb4), so can't move there. The other squares: a4, a5, a6, b6, c4, c5, c6. Now, are any of these squares attacked by Black's pieces? Black has king on g4 and pawn on h5. Black's pawn on h5 moves forward (since it's Black's pawn, it moves down the board, so from h5, it can move to h4 (if empty) or capture on g4 (but g4 has Black's king). So Black's pawn doesn't attack any squares that White's king is considering. Black's king on g4 attacks squares as we said, but none of the White king's possible moves (a4, a5, a6, b6, c4, c5, c6) are in those squares (since the closest is c4, which is far from g4). So why are the legal moves only Kc6, Kb6, Ka6, Kc5, Ka5, Kc4, Ka4? Oh, because b4 is occupied by White's pawn, so the adjacent square b4 is blocked, so the legal moves are the other seven adjacent squares, which matches the list given (the legal moves are exactly those seven). Good, so that's the legal moves.\n\nNow, what's the goal here? It's a king and pawn endgame. Let's think about the pawns first. White has a pawn on b4, Black has a pawn on h5. Let's see whose pawn is closer to promotion, and who can support their pawn.\n\nWhite's pawn is on b4: to promote, it needs to get to b8. So it has 4 squares to go (b5, b6, b7, b8), but wait, no\u2014pawns move forward: White's pawn is on b4 (rank 4), so it moves to b5 (rank 5), b6 (rank 6), b7 (rank 7), b8 (rank 8) to promote. But wait, b5 is where White's king is now, so the pawn can't move yet (since the king is in front of it). Black's pawn is on h5 (rank 5), it's Black's pawn, so it moves down to rank 4, 3, 2, 1 to promote. So from h5, it can move to h4 (rank 4) next turn (if Black gets a chance). Black's king is on g4 (rank 4), so Black's pawn on h5 is behind Black's king (since h5 is rank 5, g4 is rank 4). Wait, no\u2014for Black's pawn, moving down the board means from higher rank to lower rank, so h5 \u2192 h4 \u2192 h3 \u2192 h2 \u2192 h1 (promotion). So Black's pawn is on h5, needs to get to h1: 4 moves. White's pawn is on b4, needs to get to b8: 4 moves (b4 \u2192 b5 \u2192 b6 \u2192 b7 \u2192 b8). So both pawns have 4 moves to promotion, but their paths are blocked by their own kings? Wait, White's pawn is on b4, White's king is on b5 (in front of the pawn), so the pawn can't move until the king moves away. Black's pawn is on h5, Black's king is on g4 (to the left and front of the pawn), so the pawn can move to h4 (since h4 is empty\u2014wait, is h4 empty? Let's check: rank 4 is 1P4k1 \u2192 files a=empty, b=P (b4), c-f=empty, g=k (g4), h=empty. Yes, h4 is empty. So Black's pawn on h5 can move to h4 on Black's next turn (if White doesn't stop it).\n\nNow, let's think about the kings' positions. White's king is on b5, Black's king is on g4. The distance between them: let's count the number of squares horizontally and vertically. From b5 to g4: horizontal distance is 5 (g - b = 5), vertical distance is 1 (5-4=1). So the kings are not in contact (since they need to be adjacent to be in contact). The key in king and pawn endgames is usually king activity: which king can get to the opponent's pawn first, or support their own pawn better.\n\nFirst, let's list the immediate threats. What can Black do on their next turn if White does nothing (but White has to move, so let's think: after White moves, what can Black do). Black has two pieces: king on g4 and pawn on h5. Black's legal moves: let's not list them all, but focus on the pawn first\u2014Black's pawn on h5 can move to h4 (as it's a pawn's normal move, since it's not on the 2nd rank (for White) or 7th rank (for Black), so no double move). Can Black's pawn capture anything? To capture, it would need to move diagonally, but h5's diagonal squares are g4 (Black's king) and i6 (off the board), so no. So Black's pawn can move to h4. What about Black's king on g4: it can move to adjacent squares, but let's see if capturing is possible\u2014White has a pawn on b4, which is far from g4, so no.\n\nNow, White's options: the legal moves are all king moves (since the pawn on b4 is blocked by White's king on b5\u2014wait, no: wait, White's pawn is on b4, which is rank 4. White's pawn moves forward, so from b4, it can move to b5 (rank 5) if it's empty, but b5 has White's king, so the pawn can't move. So yes, White can only move the king.\n\nLet's list each legal king move and analyze the consequences:\n\n1. Kc6: White king moves to c6 (rank 6, file c). What's the position after this? White: Kc6, Pb4; Black: Kg4, Ph5. Now, Black's turn. What can Black do? Let's think about Black's pawn: it can move to h4 (as before). If Black plays h4, then Black's pawn is on h4, one step closer to promotion. White's king is on c6, which is far from Black's pawn. Alternatively, Black's king can move towards White's pawn: for example, Kf3 (moving towards b4). Let's see: if White plays Kc6, Black plays Kf3 (king moves from g4 to f3). Now, Black's king is on f3, which is closer to White's pawn on b4. White's next move: king can move towards Black's king or pawn, but it's far. This seems bad because White's king is moving away from both Black's pawn (on h5/h4) and Black's king (on g4/f3), and White's own pawn is stuck on b4.\n\n2. Kb6: White king moves to b6 (rank 6, file b). Similar to Kc6, but even more to the side. Black's response would be the same: move pawn to h4 or king towards White's pawn. White's king is even further from the action. Worse than Kc6.\n\n3. Ka6: White king moves to a6 (rank 6, file a). Even more to the side. Black's response is the same, and White's king is even further. Definitely bad.\n\n4. Kc5: White king moves to c5 (rank 5, file c). So White king is now on c5 (adjacent to its previous position b5). Position: White Kc5, Pb4; Black Kg4, Ph5. Black's turn. What can Black do? Again, pawn to h4 is an option. If Black plays h4, then Black's pawn is on h4. White's king is on c5, which is still far from h4, but closer than c6. Alternatively, Black's king can move towards White's pawn: Kf3 (from g4 to f3). If Black plays Kf3, then Black's king is on f3, closer to b4. White's next move: maybe Kd4 (moving towards Black's king), but it's still a long way.\n\n5. Ka5: White king moves to a5 (rank 5, file a). Similar to Kc5 but to the left. Black's response would be to move pawn or king, and White's king is on the left side, which is not helpful for stopping Black's pawn or attacking Black's king. Worse than Kc5.\n\n6. Kc4: White king moves to c4 (rank 4, file c). Now, White's king is on c4, which is rank 4 (same as Black's king on g4). White's pawn is on b4 (rank 4, file b)\u2014wait, no: White's pawn is on b4 (file b, rank 4), and White's king just moved to c4 (file c, rank 4). So the pawn is on b4, king on c4\u2014so the pawn is now unblocked! Because the king was on b5 (rank 5) before, blocking the pawn from moving to b5 (rank 5). Now, the king is on c4 (rank 4), so the pawn on b4 (rank 4) can move to b5 (rank 5) on White's next turn (if it's still there). Oh, that's an important point! I didn't think about that earlier. If White's king moves from b5 (rank 5) to a square on rank 4 (like c4 or a4), then the pawn on b4 (rank 4) is no longer blocked by the king (since the king is now on the same rank as the pawn, not in front of it). Wait, yes! Because the pawn moves forward, so from b4 (rank 4), it can move to b5 (rank 5) if that square is empty. If the king is on b5 (rank 5), then the pawn can't move. But if the king moves to c4 (rank 4), then b5 (rank 5) is empty, so the pawn can move to b5 on the next turn. That's a big deal!\n\nWait, let's confirm: White's pawn is on b4 (file b, rank 4). It's a White pawn, so it moves up the board (increasing rank). The square in front of it is b5 (rank 5). If b5 is empty, the pawn can move to b5. If b5 is occupied by a friendly piece (like the king), the pawn can't move. If b5 is occupied by an enemy piece, the pawn can capture it (but only if it's a diagonal move, which isn't the case here). So yes, if White's king moves from b5 (rank 5) to any square not on b5, then b5 becomes empty, so the pawn on b4 can move to b5 on White's next turn (if Black doesn't capture the pawn first). But Black's pieces are on g4 (king) and h5 (pawn)\u2014they are far from b4, so Black can't capture the pawn on b4 in one move.\n\nAh, that's a key insight I missed earlier. So if White moves the king from b5 to a square on rank 4 (like c4 or a4), then the pawn on b4 is unblocked and can start moving towards promotion. Whereas if White moves the king to rank 5 or 6 (like c5, a5, c6, b6, a6), then the pawn on b4 is still blocked (since the king is no longer on b5, but is the pawn blocked? Wait, no\u2014wait, if White's king moves to c5 (rank 5, file c), then b5 (rank 5, file b) is empty. So the pawn on b4 (rank 4, file b) can move to b5 (rank 5, file b) because it's empty. Oh! Wait, I made a mistake earlier. The king was on b5 (rank 5) blocking the pawn, but if the king moves to any other square (even on the same rank), then b5 (rank 5) is empty, so the pawn can move to b5. Because the pawn's path is b4 \u2192 b5 \u2192 b6 \u2192 b7 \u2192 b8. So the only thing blocking the pawn is if b5 is occupied. So if the king moves from b5 to, say, c5 (same rank, adjacent file), then b5 is empty, so the pawn can move to b5. Oh my goodness, I can't believe I missed that. So all of White's king moves (except maybe none) will unblock the pawn? Wait, no\u2014wait, the king is on b5 (file b, rank 5). The pawn is on b4 (file b, rank 4). The pawn's next move is to b5 (file b, rank 5). So if the king moves away from b5 (anywhere else), then b5 is empty, so the pawn can move to b5. Because the king was the only piece blocking the pawn (since it was on b5). So yes! All of White's legal king moves (since they all move the king away from b5) will unblock the pawn. Because the legal moves are all king moves from b5 to other squares, so b5 becomes empty, so the pawn on b4 can move to b5 on White's next turn. That's a huge mistake I made earlier\u2014thinking that some moves would keep the pawn blocked, but no\u2014any king move from b5 will unblock the pawn, because the king is no longer on b5 (the square the pawn needs to move to next). Oh wow, that changes things.\n\nOkay, let's correct that. So regardless of where White's king moves (as long as it's a legal move, which all are), the pawn on b4 will be able to move to b5 on White's next turn (since b5 will be empty). Because the king is moving away from b5, so b5 is empty. So that's a relief\u2014White's pawn is not stuck forever; it can start moving once the king moves.\n\nNow, the next thing to think about is: which king move will allow White to best support their own pawn (Pb4) and stop Black's pawn (Ph5). Because in king and pawn endgames, the king's job is usually to either support their own pawn to promotion or to stop the opponent's pawn from promoting.\n\nLet's first think about the pawn races. If both pawns start moving, who will promote first? Let's calculate:\n\n- White's pawn: currently on b4. After White's king moves (unblocking it), White can play Pb5 on the next turn. Then, from b5, it can move to b6, b7, b8 (promotion) in three more moves. So total moves for White's pawn to promote: 1 (king move to unblock) + 4 (pawn moves: b4\u2192b5\u2192b6\u2192b7\u2192b8) \u2192 wait no, no\u2014wait, the king move is this turn (turn 52), then on turn 53, White can move the pawn to b5 (if Black doesn't do anything to stop it). Then turn 54: White can move pawn to b6, turn 55: b7, turn 56: b8 (promotion). So 4 moves for the pawn to promote, starting from this turn (but the first move is king, then pawn moves).\n\n- Black's pawn: currently on h5. Black can move it to h4 on their next turn (turn 53), then h3 (turn 55), h2 (turn 57), h1 (promotion on turn 59). Wait, but turns alternate: White (52), Black (53), White (54), Black (55), White (56), Black (57), White (58), Black (59). So if White's pawn promotes on turn 56 (White's move), that's before Black's pawn promotes on turn 59 (Black's move). So White's pawn can promote three turns earlier than Black's. But wait, is that true? Let's check again:\n\n- White's turn 52: king moves (say, Kc4), unblocking Pb4.\n- Black's turn 53: Black plays h4 (Pb5? No, Black's pawn is Ph5, so h4).\n- White's turn 54: White plays Pb5 (pawn moves to b5).\n- Black's turn 55: Black plays h3 (pawn moves to h3).\n- White's turn 56: White plays Pb6 (pawn moves to b6).\n- Black's turn 57: Black plays h2 (pawn moves to h2).\n- White's turn 58: White plays Pb7 (pawn moves to b7).\n- Black's turn 59: Black plays h1=Q (promotes to queen).\n- White's turn 60: White plays Pb8=Q (promotes to queen).\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, White's pawn is on b4 in turn 52. After White's king moves in turn 52, the pawn is unblocked. So in turn 54 (White's next move after turn 52), the pawn can move to b5. Then turn 56: b6, turn 58: b7, turn 60: b8=Q. Black's pawn is on h5 in turn 52. Black can move it to h4 in turn 53 (Black's move), then h3 in turn 55, h2 in turn 57, h1=Q in turn 59. So Black's pawn promotes on turn 59 (Black's move), White's pawn promotes on turn 60 (White's move). So Black promotes one turn earlier than White. But wait, what if White can stop Black's pawn from promoting? Because if White's king can get to Black's pawn in time, then White can capture the pawn, and then White's pawn can promote without opposition.\n\nAh, right! That's the key. In king and pawn endgames, it's not just about whose pawn is faster, but also whether the kings can interfere with the opponent's pawn. So we need to calculate the \"square of the pawn\" for Black's pawn, to see if White's king can reach it in time to stop it.\n\nWhat's the square of the pawn? The square of a pawn is a square whose side is equal to the number of moves the pawn needs to promote, plus one. If the king is inside or can reach the square in time, it can stop the pawn. Let's calculate Black's pawn on h5: it needs to move 4 squares to promote (h5\u2192h4\u2192h3\u2192h2\u2192h1), so the square is from h5 to h1 (the path of the pawn) and to the left by 4 squares? Wait, no, the correct way to calculate the square of the pawn is: for a pawn that is not on the 2nd rank (so no double move), the square is a rectangle from the pawn's current position to the promotion rank, and extending to the left and right by the number of moves the pawn needs to promote. Wait, maybe a better way is to use the formula: the number of moves the pawn needs to promote is n, then the king needs to be able to reach the pawn's path in n moves or less. Let's count: Black's pawn on h5 needs 4 moves to promote (h5\u2192h4\u2192h3\u2192h2\u2192h1: that's 4 moves, since each step is a move). How many moves does White's king need to reach a square on the pawn's path (h5, h4, h3, h2, h1) before the pawn promotes?\n\nWhite's king is currently on b5. Let's see how many moves it takes for White's king to reach h1 (the promotion square of Black's pawn): from b5 to h1: let's count the minimal number of moves. The minimal number of moves for a king to move from b5 to h1 is the maximum of the horizontal and vertical distances. Horizontal distance: h - b = 6 squares. Vertical distance: 5 - 1 = 4 squares. So maximum is 6, so 6 moves. But Black's pawn needs 4 moves to promote, so White's king can't reach h1 in time. But wait, what if White's king goes to h2 instead? From b5 to h2: horizontal distance 6 (h - b), vertical distance 3 (5-2), so maximum 6 moves. Still 6 moves, which is more than 4. What about h3? From b5 to h3: horizontal 6, vertical 2, maximum 6. h4? From b5 to h4: horizontal 6, vertical 1, maximum 6. h5? From b5 to h5: horizontal 6, vertical 0, maximum 6. So all squares on Black's pawn's path take 6 moves for White's king to reach, but Black's pawn only needs 4 moves to promote. So White's king can't reach Black's pawn in time to stop it from promoting, unless... wait, but what if Black's king is in the way? Black's king is on g4, which is near Black's pawn. Wait, Black's king is on g4, which is to the left of Black's pawn on h5. So Black's king is in the square of the pawn? Let's see: Black's pawn on h5 needs 4 moves to promote. The square of the pawn is from h5 to h1 (vertical) and from d5 to h5 (horizontal, since 4 moves to the left). Wait, no, the square of the pawn for Black's pawn (which is moving down the board) is a square where the top side is the pawn's current rank (h5), the bottom side is the promotion rank (h1), and the left side is (pawn's file - number of moves to promote) = h - 4 = d (since h is the 8th file, d is the 4th file). So the square is from d5 to h5 (top row) and d1 to h1 (bottom row). Is Black's king on g4 inside this square? Yes, because g4 is between d5 and h5 (file g is between d and h) and between d1 and h1 (rank 4 is between 1 and 5). So Black's king is inside the square of Black's pawn, which means Black's king can support the pawn to promotion. Wait, but why is that important? Because if the king is inside the square, it can help the pawn advance, but in this case, Black's king is already near the pawn, so it can protect the pawn from being captured by White's king. But wait, White's king is far away, so maybe Black's king doesn't need to protect it.\n\nWait, but let's go back to White's options. We know that White's king can't reach Black's pawn in time to stop it from promoting (since it takes 6 moves for White's king to reach Black's pawn's path, and Black's pawn only needs 4 moves to promote). So if White can't stop Black's pawn from promoting, then White needs to make sure that their own pawn can promote, and then after both sides promote, White has a winning position with queens on the board. But wait, if Black promotes first (on turn 59), then Black will have a queen on h1, and White's pawn is on b7 (if White's pawn moved to b7 on turn 58). Then, on Black's turn 59, after promoting to queen, Black can use the queen to attack White's king or pawn. But wait, let's think step by step with a specific move. Let's take White's move Kc4 (one of the legal moves), which is moving the king to c4 (rank 4, file c). Let's see what happens:\n\nWhite's turn 52: Kc4 (White king moves from b5 to c4). Now, position: White Kc4, Pb4; Black Kg4, Ph5.\n\nBlack's turn 53: What can Black do? Let's say Black plays h4 (Black's pawn moves from h5 to h4). Now, position: White Kc4, Pb4; Black Kg4, Ph4.\n\nWhite's turn 54: Now, White's pawn on b4 is unblocked (since White's king moved from b5 to c4, so b5 is empty). So White can play Pb5 (pawn moves from b4 to b5). Position: White Kc4, Pb5; Black Kg4, Ph4.\n\nBlack's turn 55: Black can play h3 (pawn moves from h4 to h3). Position: White Kc4, Pb5; Black Kg4, Ph3.\n\nWhite's turn 56: White plays Pb6 (pawn moves from b5 to b6). Position: White Kc4, Pb6; Black Kg4, Ph3.\n\nBlack's turn 57: Black plays h2 (pawn moves from h3 to h2). Position: White Kc4, Pb6; Black Kg4, Ph2.\n\nWhite's turn 58: White plays Pb7 (pawn moves from b6 to b7). Position: White Kc4, Pb7; Black Kg4, Ph2.\n\nBlack's turn 59: Black plays h1=Q (pawn promotes to queen on h1). Position: White Kc4, Pb7; Black Kg4, Qh1.\n\nWhite's turn 60: White plays Pb8=Q (pawn promotes to queen on b8). Position: White Kc4, Qb8; Black Kg4, Qh1.\n\nNow, we have a queen endgame with both sides having a queen and a king. Is this a winning position for White? It's hard to say, but maybe not\u2014queen endgames are often drawn if both sides have queens, but it depends on the positions of the kings and queens. But wait, what if Black doesn't promote their pawn right away? Or what if Black uses their king to help the pawn? Wait, Black's king is on g4, which is near their pawn. What if Black uses their king to block White's king from supporting their pawn? For example, after White plays Kc4, Black plays Kf3 (king moves from g4 to f3) instead of moving the pawn. Let's see that line:\n\nWhite's turn 52: Kc4.\n\nBlack's turn 53: Kf3 (Black king moves to f3).\n\nWhite's turn 54: Pb5 (White pawn moves to b5).\n\nBlack's turn 55: Ke2 (Black king moves to e2).\n\nWhite's turn 56: Pb6 (White pawn moves to b6).\n\nBlack's turn 57: Kd1 (Black king moves to d1).\n\nWhite's turn 58: Pb7 (White pawn moves to b7).\n\nBlack's turn 59: Kc1 (Black king moves to c1).\n\nWhite's turn 60: Pb8=Q (White promotes to queen).\n\nNow, Black's king is on c1, White's queen is on b8. Black's pawn is on h5 (wait no, in this line, Black didn't move their pawn\u2014oh, right, because Black was moving their king instead of the pawn. So Black's pawn is still on h5 in this line. Wait, that's a problem for Black\u2014if Black spends all their moves moving their king towards White's pawn, then their own pawn doesn't advance, so White's pawn can promote first, and then White's queen can capture Black's pawn. Oh, right! I forgot that Black has a choice: they can either move their pawn towards promotion or move their king towards White's pawn. They can't do both at the same time (since each turn you can only make one move). So that's a critical choice for Black, and we need to consider which choice is better for Black, because White has to plan for Black's best response.\n\nAh, yes! That's the key mistake in the earlier analysis. Black has two options on their turn: they can either advance their own pawn (to try to promote it) or move their king towards White's pawn (to try to capture it, thus preventing White from promoting). Black will choose the option that is best for them, i.e., the option that gives them the best chance to win or draw. So White has to consider both possibilities and choose a king move that is best against Black's best response.\n\nSo let's rephrase: for each of White's legal king moves, we need to consider two scenarios for Black's response: (a) Black advances their pawn (h5\u2192h4\u2192...), or (b) Black moves their king towards White's pawn (g4\u2192f3\u2192e2\u2192d1\u2192c1\u2192b2\u2192b3\u2192b4, to capture White's pawn on b4). Then, we need to see which of these scenarios is better for Black, and then see which White king move is best against Black's best scenario.\n\nFirst, let's define the two scenarios clearly:\n\nScenario A (Black advances their pawn): Black's goal is to promote their pawn to a queen as quickly as possible, even if that means leaving their king far from White's pawn.\n\nScenario B (Black moves their king towards White's pawn): Black's goal is to capture White's pawn (Pb4) before it can promote, even if that means their own pawn doesn't advance.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many moves it takes for Black's king to reach White's pawn (Pb4) from its current position (Kg4). White's pawn is on b4 (file b, rank 4). Black's king is on g4 (file g, rank 4). The minimal number of moves for Black's king to reach b4 is the horizontal distance between g4 and b4, since they are on the same rank (rank 4). The horizontal distance is 5 squares (g to b is 5 files: g\u2192f\u2192e\u2192d\u2192c\u2192b), so it takes 5 moves for Black's king to reach b4 (since the king moves one square per turn). Let's confirm: Kg4\u2192Kf4 (1 move), Kf4\u2192Ke4 (2), Ke4\u2192Kd4 (3), Kd4\u2192Kc4 (4), Kc4\u2192Kb4 (5). Yes, 5 moves to reach b4, where White's pawn is. Now, how many moves does White's pawn need to promote, assuming Black's king is moving towards it? White's pawn is on b4. To promote, it needs to move to b5\u2192b6\u2192b7\u2192b8 (4 moves). But if Black's king is moving towards it, can Black's king capture the pawn before it promotes? Let's see:\n\n- White's turn 52: King moves (say, Kc4), unblocking Pb4.\n- Black's turn 53: Black king moves to f4 (1st move towards b4).\n- White's turn 54: White pawn moves to b5 (1st move towards promotion).\n- Black's turn 55: Black king moves to e4 (2nd move towards b4).\n- White's turn 56: White pawn moves to b6 (2nd move towards promotion).\n- Black's turn 57: Black king moves to d4 (3rd move towards b4).\n- White's turn 58: White pawn moves to b7 (3rd move towards promotion).\n- Black's turn 59: Black king moves to c4 (4th move towards b4).\n- White's turn 60: White pawn moves to b8=Q (4th move, promotion).\n- Black's turn 61: Black king moves to b4 (5th move, but White's pawn is already promoted to queen on b8, so Black can't capture it).\n\nAh, so even if Black moves their king towards White's pawn, White's pawn can promote before Black's king can reach it. Because White's pawn takes 4 moves to promote (from b4 to b8), and Black's king takes 5 moves to reach b4 (where the pawn was). So by the time Black's king reaches b4, White's pawn is already a queen on b8. That's a crucial point! So Scenario B (Black moving their king towards White's pawn) is useless for Black, because White's pawn can promote before Black's king can capture it. Therefore, Black's best option is Scenario A (advancing their own pawn), because that's the only way they can get a queen before White, or at least at the same time, which might give them a chance to win or draw.\n\nWait, let's confirm that calculation again, because it's so important. Let's take a concrete example where White plays Kc4 (move 52), and Black plays Kf3 (move 53, moving towards White's pawn):\n\nMove 52 (White): Kc4 (White king on c4, pawn on b4)\nMove 53 (Black): Kf3 (Black king on f3, pawn on h5)\nMove 54 (White): Pb5 (White pawn on b5)\nMove 55 (Black): Ke2 (Black king on e2)\nMove 56 (White): Pb6 (White pawn on b6)\nMove 57 (Black): Kd1 (Black king on d1)\nMove 58 (White): Pb7 (White pawn on b7)\nMove 59 (Black): Kc1 (Black king on c1)\nMove 60 (White): Pb8=Q (White pawn promotes to queen on b8)\nMove 61 (Black): Kb2 (Black king on b2)\nMove 62 (White): Qb7+ (White queen moves to b7, checking Black's king)\n\nNow, White has a queen, Black has a king on b2 and a pawn on h5. White can easily win this game by using the queen to capture Black's pawn and then checkmating the king. So yes, Scenario B is a losing option for Black, because White gets a queen first and can then win easily. Therefore, Black's only viable option is Scenario A (advancing their own pawn), because that's the only way they can get a queen, which might give them a chance to draw or win.\n\nOkay, so now we can ignore Scenario B (since Black won't choose it, as it's worse for them), and focus only on Scenario A (Black advancing their pawn). Now, our problem reduces to: White needs to choose a king move (from the legal options) such that, when Black advances their pawn (h5\u2192h4\u2192h3\u2192h2\u2192h1=Q), White can either (a) promote their own pawn before Black and then win with the queen, or (b) if Black promotes first, White can still promote their pawn and then have a winning or drawing position with both queens on the board.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that if White's king moves to c4 (for example), then Black's pawn promotes on turn 59 (Black's move), and White's pawn promotes on turn 60 (White's move). So Black promotes one turn earlier than White. But what if White's king can move in a way that allows their pawn to promote at the same time as Black's, or even earlier? Is that possible?\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the promotion turns for White's pawn, depending on where White's king moves. Because the king's move determines when the pawn can start moving. Wait, no\u2014wait, regardless of where White's king moves (as long as it's a legal move), the pawn on b4 is unblocked (since the king moves away from b5), so the pawn can start moving on White's next turn (turn 54). Because the king's move is on turn 52, then turn 53 is Black's move, turn 54 is White's move, so the pawn can move on turn 54. So the promotion turn for White's pawn is always turn 60, regardless of where the king moves (as long as the pawn is unblocked, which it is after any king move). Wait, is that true? Let's confirm with two different king moves:\n\nExample 1: White plays Kc6 (turn 52). Then, turn 53: Black plays h4. Turn 54: White plays Pb5. Turn 55: Black plays h3. Turn 56: White plays Pb6. Turn 57: Black plays h2. Turn 58: White plays Pb7. Turn 59: Black plays h1=Q. Turn 60: White plays Pb8=Q. Same as before\u2014White promotes on turn 60.\n\nExample 2: White plays Kc4 (turn 52). Turn 53: Black plays h4. Turn 54: White plays Pb5. Turn 55: Black plays h3. Turn 56: White plays Pb6. Turn 57: Black plays h2. Turn 58: White plays Pb7. Turn 59: Black plays h1=Q. Turn 60: White plays Pb8=Q. Same promotion turn.\n\nExample 3: White plays Ka4 (turn 52). Turn 53: Black plays h4. Turn 54: White plays Pb5. Turn 55: Black plays h3. Turn 56: White plays Pb6. Turn 57: Black plays h2. Turn 58: White plays Pb7. Turn 59: Black plays h1=Q. Turn 60: White plays Pb8=Q. Same promotion turn.\n\nAh, so yes! Regardless of where White's king moves (as long as it's a legal move, which unblocks the pawn), White's pawn will promote on turn 60, and Black's pawn will promote on turn 59. So Black will always promote their pawn one turn earlier than White. That's a fixed fact, because Black's pawn is one move ahead in the promotion race (Black's pawn needs 4 moves to promote, starting from turn 53: h5\u2192h4 (53), h3 (55), h2 (57), h1=Q (59)\u20144 moves, promotion on turn 59. White's pawn needs 4 moves to promote, starting from turn 54: b4\u2192b5 (54), b6 (56), b7 (58), b8=Q (60)\u20144 moves, promotion on turn 60). So Black promotes one turn earlier.\n\nNow, the question is: when Black promotes their pawn to a queen on turn 59 (h1=Q), what is the position of White's king and pawn, and can White's king protect the pawn from being captured by Black's new queen, so that White can promote their pawn on turn 60?\n\nBecause if Black's queen can capture White's pawn on turn 59 (after promoting), then White won't be able to promote their pawn, and Black will have a queen against White's king, which is a win for Black. But if White's king is in a position to protect the pawn on turn 59 (when Black promotes), then Black's queen can't capture the pawn (because it's protected by White's king), so White can promote their pawn on turn 60, resulting in both sides having queens, which is a more balanced position (though White might still win).\n\nAh! That's the key. Because when Black promotes their pawn to a queen on h1 (turn 59), White's pawn is on b7 (since White played Pb7 on turn 58). So White's pawn is on b7, and White's king is somewhere on the board (depending on where it moved on turn 52 and subsequent turns). Black's new queen is on h1. Can Black's queen capture White's pawn on b7 on turn 59? Let's see: the queen can move any number of squares in any direction, so from h1 to b7 is a diagonal move (h1\u2192g2\u2192f3\u2192e4\u2192d5\u2192c6\u2192b7), which is 6 squares. Is that path clear? Let's check the position on turn 59, just before Black promotes:\n\n- Turn 58 (White's move): White plays Pb7 (pawn moves from b6 to b7). So position after turn 58: White's king is on X (where X is the square it moved to on turn 52, plus any subsequent moves? Wait no\u2014wait, no! Oh my God, I made another huge mistake. The king doesn't just move once on turn 52 and then stay there! The king can move every turn, just like any other piece. I can't believe I forgot that. The initial analysis said that White's legal moves on turn 52 are king moves, but after that, on turn 54, 56, etc., White can move either the king or the pawn (once the pawn is unblocked). Oh my goodness, that changes everything. I can't believe I made such a stupid mistake. The entire previous analysis assumed that White's king only moves once on turn 52 and then stays there, but that's not true. White can move the king every turn, or move the pawn when possible. Oh wow, that's a catastrophic error. I need to start over, from scratch, with this correct understanding.\n\nOkay, let's start over, correctly this time.\n\nFirst, the position on turn 52, White's turn:\n\n- White's pieces: King on b5 (Kb5), Pawn on b4 (Pb4).\n- Black's pieces: King on g4 (Kg4), Pawn on h5 (Ph5).\n- Legal moves for White on turn 52: All king moves from b5 to adjacent squares that are not occupied and not attacked by Black's pieces. As before, the adjacent squares to b5 are a4, a5, a6, b4, b6, c4, c5, c6. b4 is occupied by White's pawn, so can't move there. The other squares: a4, a5, a6, b6, c4, c5, c6. Are any of these squares attacked by Black's pieces? Black's king is on g4, which attacks squares f3, f4, f5, g3, g5, h3, h4, h5. None of White's king's possible moves are in those squares. Black's pawn on h5 attacks squares g4 (but that's Black's king) and i6 (off the board), so no. So legal moves for White on turn 52 are indeed Kc6, Kb6, Ka6, Kc5, Ka5, Kc4, Ka4 (as given).\n\nNow, the key correction: After turn 52, White can move either the king or the pawn on subsequent turns, depending on the position. For example, if White moves their king to c4 on turn 52 (Kc4), then on turn 54 (White's next move), White can choose to move the pawn to b5 (Pb5) or move the king again (e.g., Kd5, Kd4, etc.). Oh my God, that's so important. I can't believe I forgot that. The king can move every turn, not just once. So the previous analysis was completely wrong because it assumed the king stays in one place after turn 52, but in reality, the king can move every turn to support the pawn or stop Black's pawn.\n\nOkay, let's start over with the correct understanding that both kings can move every turn, and pawns can move when possible.\n\nThe goal in king and pawn endgames is to promote your pawn to a queen while preventing the opponent from doing the same. The most important factors are:\n\n1. The relative speed of the pawns (who can promote first).\n2. The ability of the kings to support their own pawns and hinder the opponent's pawns.\n\nFirst, let's re-evaluate the pawn speeds, considering that kings can move to support their pawns:\n\n- White's pawn is on b4. To promote, it needs to reach b8. The path is b4\u2192b5\u2192b6\u2192b7\u2192b8. Each move is a forward move (no captures needed, since the path is empty except for the king, which can move out of the way).\n- Black's pawn is on h5. To promote, it needs to reach h1. The path is h5\u2192h4\u2192h3\u2192h2\u2192h1. Each move is a forward move (path is empty except for the king, which can move out of the way).\n\nNow, let's consider the kings' ability to support their pawns:\n\n- White's king is on b5, which is in front of White's pawn (on b4). So the king is blocking the pawn, but can move to the side to let the pawn pass, and then follow to support it.\n- Black's king is on g4, which is to the left of Black's pawn (on h5). So the king is not blocking the pawn, and can move to the right to support it (e.g., Kg5, Kg6, etc.) or to the left to hinder White's pawn.\n\nNow, let's think about the concept of \"king opposition\" and \"shouldering,\" but maybe more importantly, let's use the correct method for king and pawn endgames: calculate the \"race\" with both kings moving to support their own pawns and hinder the opponent's.\n\nFirst, let's consider what happens if both players focus on supporting their own pawns:\n\n- White's plan: Move the king to the side to let the pawn pass (e.g., Kc4 or Ka4), then move the pawn forward, and then move the king behind the pawn to support it (e.g., after Pb5, play Kc5 to support the pawn on b5).\n- Black's plan: Move the king to the right to support the pawn (e.g., Kg5 to be in front of the pawn on h5), then move the pawn forward, and then move the king behind the pawn to support it.\n\nBut wait, Black's pawn is on h5, and Black's king is on g4. To support the pawn, Black's king should be in front of the pawn (on h4, h5, or h6), but h5 has the pawn, so h4 or h6. Black's king can move to h4 on turn 53 (if White moves their king to c4 on turn 52), which would be in front of the pawn (h5). Then, the pawn can move to h4, but wait, no\u2014Black's pawn is on h5, so it moves to h4, which is where Black's king would be if Black plays Kg4\u2192Kh4 on turn 53. So Black's king can't be on h4 and have the pawn move to h4\u2014they would be on the same square, which is impossible. So Black's king should be on g5 (to the right of the pawn on h5) to support it, because then the pawn can move to h4, and the king can move to h4 to support it.\n\nWait, maybe let's take a concrete example where both players play optimally to support their own pawns:\n\nTurn 52 (White): Kc4 (White king moves to c4, letting the pawn on b4 move to b5 next turn).\nTurn 53 (Black): Kg5 (Black king moves to g5, moving towards the pawn on h5 to support it).\nTurn 54 (White): Pb5 (White pawn moves to b5, now unblocked).\nTurn 55 (Black): h4 (Black pawn moves to h4, supported by the king on g5).\nTurn 56 (White): Kc5 (White king moves to c5, supporting the pawn on b5).\nTurn 57 (Black): Kh4 (Black king moves to h4, supporting the pawn on h4).\nTurn 58 (White): Pb6 (White pawn moves to b6, supported by the king on c5).\nTurn 59 (Black): h3 (Black pawn moves to h3, supported by the king on h4).\nTurn 60 (White): Kc6 (White king moves to c6, supporting the pawn on b6).\nTurn 61 (Black): Kh3 (Black king moves to h3, supporting the pawn on h3).\nTurn 62 (White): Pb7 (White pawn moves to b7, supported by the king on c6).\nTurn 63 (Black): h2 (Black pawn moves to h2, supported by the king on h3).\nTurn 64 (White): Kc7 (White king moves to c7, supporting the pawn on b7).\nTurn 65 (Black): Kh2 (Black king moves to h2, supporting the pawn on h2).\nTurn 66 (White): Pb8=Q+ (White pawn promotes to queen on b8, checking Black's king on h2).\nTurn 67 (Black): Kh1 (Black king moves to h1 to get out of check).\nTurn 68 (White): Qb2 (White queen moves to b2, attacking Black's pawn on h2).\nTurn 69 (Black): h1=Q (Black pawn promotes to queen on h1).\nTurn 70 (White): Qxh2+ (White queen captures Black's pawn on h2, checking Black's king on h1).\nTurn 71 (Black): Qxh2 (Black queen captures White's queen on h2).\nTurn 72 (White): Kxh2 (White king captures Black's queen on h2).\n\nWait, that's a lot of moves, but in this line, White promotes their pawn to a queen on turn 66, and Black promotes theirs on turn 69. So White promotes three turns earlier than Black. Why? Because White's king is able to support the pawn more effectively, moving along the c-file to support the pawn on the b-file, while Black's king has to move along the h-file to support the pawn on the h-file. The key difference is that White's king is on the same color file as the pawn (c-file for b-file pawn), so it can support the pawn without getting in the way, whereas Black's king is on the same file as the pawn (h-file), so it has to move in front of the pawn to support it, which is slower.\n\nWait, but why did White promote earlier in this line? Because White's king was able to move to the c-file (c4\u2192c5\u2192c6\u2192c7) to support the pawn on the b-file (b4\u2192b5\u2192b6\u2192b7\u2192b8), while Black's king had to move to the h-file (g4\u2192g5\u2192h4\u2192h3\u2192h2\u2192h1) to support the pawn on the h-file. The c-file is adjacent to the b-file, so White's king can support the pawn without blocking it, whereas Black's king is on the same file as the pawn, so it has to block the pawn to support it, which slows down the pawn's advance.\n\nAh, right! The concept here is that a king can support a pawn more effectively if it's on an adjacent file rather than the same file, because it doesn't block the pawn's path. So White's king on the c-file (adjacent to the b-file pawn) can support the pawn without blocking it, allowing the pawn to advance every turn, while Black's king on the h-file (same as the h-file pawn) has to move in front of the pawn, which blocks the pawn's path, so the pawn can only advance every other turn (since the king has to move first).\n\nWait, let's verify that with the example above:\n\n- White's pawn on b-file: moves on turns 54, 58, 62, 66 (every 4 turns, 4 moves to promote).\n- White's king on c-file: moves on turns 52, 56, 60, 64 (every 4 turns, 4 moves to support the pawn).\n- Black's pawn on h-file: moves on turns 55, 59, 63, 69 (every 4 turns, but wait, 55 to 59 is 4 turns, 59 to 63 is 4, 63 to 69 is 6\u2014oh, because Black's king had to move on turn 67, so the pawn couldn't move then).\n- Black's king on h-file: moves on turns 53, 57, 61, 65, 67 (every 2 turns, 5 moves to support the pawn).\n\nAh, so White's pawn advances every White turn (since the king is on an adjacent file, not blocking it), while Black's pawn advances every other Black turn (since the king is on the same file, blocking it, so the king has to move first, then the pawn). Therefore, White's pawn promotes faster than Black's pawn, even though they started at similar positions.\n\nThis is a key strategic point in king and pawn endgames: the king should be on an adjacent file to the pawn to support it without blocking, allowing the pawn to advance every turn.\n\nNow, going back to the initial position, White's king is on b5 (same file as the pawn on b4). To support the pawn effectively, White's king should move to the c-file (adjacent to the b-file) or the a-file (also adjacent to the b-file) to get off the same file as the pawn, allowing the pawn to advance every turn.\n\nThe legal moves for White's king on turn 52 include moves to the c-file (c4, c5, c6) and moves to the a-file (a4, a5, a6), as well as b6 (same file as the pawn). Moving to the c-file or a-file will allow the pawn to advance every turn, while moving to the same file (b6) will keep the king on the same file as the pawn, blocking it, so the pawn can't advance until the king moves again.\n\nWait, no\u2014if White's king moves to b6 (same file as the pawn, but one square ahead), then the pawn on b4 can move to b5 (since b5 is empty), so the king is on b6, pawn on b5\u2014then the pawn can move to b6, but the king is there, so the pawn can't move until the king moves again. So yes, moving to the same file as the pawn (b6) will block the pawn after the first advance, whereas moving to an adjacent file (c-file or a-file) will allow the pawn to advance every turn, since the king is not on the same file, so it doesn't block the pawn's path.\n\nTherefore, White's best strategic move is to move the king to an adjacent file (c-file or a-file) to support the pawn without blocking it, allowing the pawn to advance every turn, which will make it promote faster than Black's pawn.\n\nNow, let's consider the legal moves for White's king on turn 52:\n\n- Moves to c-file (adjacent to b-file): c4, c5, c6.\n- Moves to a-file (adjacent to b-file): a4, a5, a6.\n- Moves to b-file (same as b-file): b6 (but b6 is on the same file as the pawn, which is b4\u2014wait, no, b6 is on the same file as the pawn (b-file), but the pawn is on b4, so the king on b6 is two squares ahead of the pawn, so it doesn't block the pawn's path to b5, b6\u2014wait, no, the pawn on b4 moves to b5, then b6. If the king is on b6, then when the pawn is on b5, it can move to b6, but the king is there, so it can't. Oh, right! So if White's king moves to b6 (same file as the pawn) on turn 52, then on turn 54, White can move the pawn to b5, but on turn 56, White can't move the pawn to b6 (since the king is there), so White has to move the king first (e.g., Kb7 on turn 56), then the pawn can move to b6 on turn 58. So this slows down the pawn's advance, as the king is on the same file, blocking the pawn's path after the first move.\n\nTherefore, the best moves for White are the ones that move the king to an adjacent file (c-file or a-file), allowing the pawn to advance every turn without being blocked by the king.\n\nNow, between the c-file and a-file, which is better? Let's consider the position of Black's king, which is on g4 (f-file? No, g4 is file g, rank 4). White's king on the c-file is closer to the center of the board, which is generally better in endgames, as it gives the king more mobility to reach either side of the board. White's king on the a-file is on the edge of the board, which limits its mobility, making it harder to reach the center or the Black's side of the board.\n\nAdditionally, moving to the c-file (e.g., Kc4, Kc5, Kc6) puts White's king on a file that is closer to Black's king on g4, which may allow White's king to interfere with Black's king's ability to support their pawn. Moving to the a-file (e.g., Ka4, Ka5, Ka6) puts White's king far from Black's king, allowing Black's king to freely support their pawn without interference.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific moves to the c-file:\n\n- Kc4: Moves the king to c4 (rank 4, file c). This is on the same rank as Black's king (g4, rank 4), so it's a \"lateral\" move towards the center.\n- Kc5: Moves the king to c5 (rank 5, file c). This is on the same rank as the pawn (b4, rank 4? No, b4 is rank 4, c5 is rank 5).\n- Kc6: Moves the king to c6 (rank 6, file c). This is a move towards the promotion rank of the pawn (b8), but it's further from the center.\n\nWhich of these c-file moves is best? Let's consider the concept of \"king activity\"\u2014the king should be as active as possible, meaning it should be in a position to support its own pawn and hinder the opponent's pawn.\n\nKc4 is on the same rank as Black's king (g4), so it's in a position to potentially \"shoulder\" Black's king, preventing it from moving towards White's pawn or supporting their own pawn. Shouldering is a tactic where a king moves to a square adjacent to the opponent's king, blocking it from moving in a certain direction.\n\nFor example, if White plays Kc4 on turn 52, then Black's king on g4 can't move to f4 (since White's king is on c4, which is not adjacent\u2014wait, no, shouldering is when the kings are adjacent. Oh, right, shouldering requires the kings to be adjacent, so that one king blocks the other from moving in a certain direction. In the initial position, the kings are not adjacent (White's king on b5, Black's on g4), so shouldering isn't possible yet, but moving the king towards the opponent's king can set up shouldering later.\n\nKc4 is a move towards the center, which is good for king activity. It puts the king on the same rank as Black's king, which may allow White's king to move towards Black's king in subsequent turns to block it.\n\nKc5 is a move towards the pawn (b4), which is good for supporting the pawn, but it's on a higher rank than Black's king, so it's further from the center.\n\nKc6 is a move towards the promotion rank, but it's further from the center and Black's king, so it's less active.\n\nBetween Kc4, Kc5, and Kc6, Kc4 is the most active move, as it's towards the center and the opponent's king, allowing White's king to be more flexible in supporting its own pawn and hindering Black's pawn.\n\nNow, let's consider the a-file moves (Ka4, Ka5, Ka6). These moves take the king to the edge of the board, which is bad for king activity, as it limits the king's mobility. For example, if White plays Ka4, then the king is on the edge, so it can't move to the left (since there are no files to the left of a), and it's far from the center, so it can't easily reach Black's side of the board to hinder their pawn. These moves are clearly worse than the c-file moves.\n\nNow, between the c-file moves, let's consider Kc4 specifically. What happens if White plays Kc4 on turn 52, and then plays optimally to support the pawn and hinder Black's pawn:\n\nTurn 52 (White): Kc4 (King moves to c4, center, adjacent file to pawn).\nTurn 53 (Black): Kg5 (King moves to g5, towards their pawn).\nTurn 54 (White): Pb5 (Pawn moves to b5, unblocked).\nTurn 55 (Black): h4 (Pawn moves to h4).\nTurn 56 (White): Kd5 (King moves to d5, towards center and Black's king).\nTurn 57 (Black): Kh4 (King moves to h4, supporting their pawn).\nTurn 58 (White): Pb6 (Pawn moves to b6, supported by king on d5).\nTurn 59 (Black): h3 (Pawn moves to h3).\nTurn 60 (White): Ke5 (King moves to e5, towards Black's king).\nTurn 61 (Black): Kh3 (King moves to h3, supporting their pawn).\nTurn 62 (White): Pb7 (Pawn moves to b7, supported by king on e5).\nTurn 63 (Black): h2 (Pawn moves to h2).\nTurn 64 (White): Kf5 (King moves to f5, adjacent to Black's king on h3\u2014wait, no, f5 is far from h3. Wait, Ke5 to Kf5 is towards Black's king on h3? No, Kf5 is towards the center, but Black's king is on h3. Maybe White's king should move towards Black's king to shoulder it. Let's correct that:\n\nTurn 60 (White): Kf5 (King moves from e5 to f5, towards Black's king on h3).\nTurn 61 (Black): Kh3 (King moves to h3).\nTurn 62 (White): Kg5 (King moves to g5, adjacent to Black's king on h3\u2014shouldering!).\nNow, Black's king on h3 is shouldered by White's king on g5, so it can't move to g4, g3, or f3 (since those squares are attacked by White's king). Black's only moves are h2 (pawn) or Kh2, Kh4.\nTurn 63 (Black): h2 (Pawn moves to h2).\nTurn 64 (White): Pb7 (Pawn moves to b7).\nTurn 65 (Black): Kh2 (King moves to h2, avoiding the shoulder).\nTurn 66 (White): Pb8=Q (Pawn promotes to queen).\nTurn 67 (Black): h1=Q (Pawn promotes to queen).\n\nNow, White has a queen on b8, Black has a queen on h1. White's king is on g5, Black's king is on h2. White's queen is in a better position (on b8, closer to the center) than Black's queen (on h1, edge of the board). White can use their queen to attack Black's king and queen, potentially winning the game.\n\nThis example shows that by moving the king to the c-file (Kc4) on turn 52, White can keep the king active, support the pawn without blocking it, and eventually shoulder Black's king, hindering their ability to support their pawn, leading to White promoting their pawn first and having a better position with the queen.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if White plays a move to the a-file, say Ka4, on turn 52:\n\nTurn 52 (White): Ka4 (King moves to a4, edge of the board).\nTurn 53 (Black): Kg5 (King moves to g5, center).\nTurn 54 (White): Pb5 (Pawn moves to b5).\nTurn 55 (Black): h4 (Pawn moves to h4).\nTurn 56 (White): Ka5 (King moves to a5, edge).\nTurn 57 (Black): Kh4 (King moves to h4).\nTurn 58 (White): Pb6 (Pawn moves to b6).\nTurn 59 (Black): h3 (Pawn moves to h3).\nTurn 60 (White): Ka6 (King moves to a6, edge).\nTurn 61 (Black): Kh3 (King moves to h3).\nTurn 62 (White): Pb7 (Pawn moves to b7).\nTurn 63 (Black): h2 (Pawn moves to h2).\nTurn 64 (White): Ka7 (King moves to a7, edge).\nTurn 65 (Black): h1=Q (Pawn promotes to queen).\nTurn 66 (White): Pb8=Q (Pawn promotes to queen).\n\nNow, White's king is on a7 (edge), Black's king is on h3 (center). White's queen is on b8 (edge), Black's queen is on h1 (edge). Black's queen is in a better position (closer to the center) than White's queen, so Black has a better chance to win this endgame. This shows that moving the king to the a-file (edge) is worse than moving to the c-file (center), as it keeps the king passive and limits its ability to hinder Black's king and pawn.\n\nNow, let's consider the other c-file moves, Kc5 and Kc6:\n\n- Kc5: This move puts the king on c5, which is closer to the pawn on b4, but further from the center than Kc4. It still allows the pawn to advance every turn, but the king is less active than Kc4.\n- Kc6: This move puts the king on c6, which is further from the center and Black's king, making it less active than Kc4 and Kc5. It still allows the pawn to advance every turn, but the king is too far from the action to hinder Black's king and pawn.\n\nTherefore, among the c-file moves, Kc4 is the most active and best move for White, as it puts the king in the center, allows the pawn to advance every turn without being blocked, and gives the king the ability to move towards Black's king to shoulder it, hindering Black's ability to support their pawn.\n\nNow, let's confirm that Kc4 is a legal move (yes, it's in the list of legal moves given: Kc6, Kb6, Ka6, Kc5, Ka5, Kc4, Ka4).\n\nFinally, let's consider if there are any other factors we missed, such as stalemate or draw by repetition, but in this position, there's no chance of stalemate (both sides have moves to make), and draw by repetition is unlikely since both sides are advancing their pawns.\n\nAnother factor is the \"outside passed pawn\"\u2014White's pawn on b4 is an outside passed pawn (since it's on the edge of the board, far from Black's pawn on h5), which is a strength because it forces Black's king to choose between stopping it or their own pawn. But we already established that Black can't stop White's pawn from promoting, so the outside passed pawn is a winning asset for White, as long as White can promote it before Black's pawn or at the same time, and then win with the queen.\n\nIn conclusion, the best move for White is Kc4, as it moves the king to the center (c-file), allows the pawn to advance every turn without being blocked, keeps the king active to hinder Black's king and pawn, and sets up the possibility of shouldering Black's king to slow down their pawn's advance.\nKc4"
