        "content": "Got it, let's try to solve this problem step by step. First, I need to remember the position from the FEN: 8/8/5k2/6p1/4K3/4P3/8/8 w - - 1 58. Let's parse that:\n\n- White's pieces: King on e4 (wait, no, wait FEN order is ranks 8 to 1, so the 4th rank from the bottom is rank 5? Wait no, let's do it properly: FEN is [rank 8][rank 7][rank 6][rank 5][rank 4][rank 3][rank 2][rank 1]. So:\n  - Rank 8: 8 (empty)\n  - Rank 7: 8 (empty)\n  - Rank 6: 5k2 \u2192 squares f6 is king (black), since 5 empty then k then 2 empty: so e6, f6, g6? Wait no, 5k2 means 5 characters of empty, then k, then 2 empty. So rank 6 (from the top, 6th rank) has black king on f6 (since a6 to e6 are empty (5), f6 is k, g6 and h6 are empty (2)). \n  - Rank 5: 6p1 \u2192 6 empty, then p, then 1 empty. So rank 5 has black pawn on g5 (a5 to f5 empty (6), g5 is p, h5 empty (1)). \n  - Rank 4: 4K3 \u2192 4 empty, then K, then 3 empty. So white king on e4 (a4 to d4 empty (4), e4 is K, f4 to h4 empty (3)). \n  - Rank 3: 4P3 \u2192 4 empty, then P, then 3 empty. So white pawn on e3 (a3 to d3 empty (4), e3 is P, f3 to h3 empty (3)). \n  - Ranks 2 and 1: 8 (empty). \n\nSo the position is (from white's perspective, rank 1 is white's starting rank):\n- White: K on e4 (4th rank, e file), P on e3 (3rd rank, e file).\n- Black: K on f6 (6th rank, f file), P on g5 (5th rank, g file).\n- It's white's turn, 58th move, no castling rights (since kings have moved, or no castling mentioned), no en passant (since last move wasn't a pawn moving 2 squares; FEN has \"-\" for en passant).\n\nLegal moves for white: the problem says e4d5, e4d4, e4f3, e4d3. Wait, wait\u2014wait, no, wait: the legal moves are given as those, but wait, white's pieces are K on e4 and P on e3. Oh, right! Because the legal moves are for the current player, which is white. So white's king is on e4 (since 4K3 on rank 4: yes, rank 4 is the 4th rank from the top, so from white's perspective, it's the 5th rank? Wait no, no\u2014let's not get confused with perspective. Let's just use coordinates as per FEN: each rank is 1-8, with rank 1 being white's starting rank (where white's pawns are on rank 2 initially). Wait no, no: FEN uses standard algebraic notation, where rank 1 is the first rank (white's home rank), rank 8 is the eighth rank (black's home rank). So:\n- Rank 1: white's back rank (a1 to h1).\n- Rank 2: white's pawn rank (a2 to h2).\n- Rank 7: black's pawn rank (a7 to h7).\n- Rank 8: black's back rank (a8 to h8).\n\nSo the FEN \"8/8/5k2/6p1/4K3/4P3/8/8\" means:\n- Rank 8 (black's back rank): 8 empty squares (a8-h8: empty).\n- Rank 7 (black's pawn rank): 8 empty squares (a7-h7: empty).\n- Rank 6 (6th rank from white's perspective, 3rd from black's): 5k2 \u2192 a6-e6: empty (5), f6: black king (k), g6-h6: empty (2). So black king is on f6.\n- Rank 5 (5th rank from white's perspective): 6p1 \u2192 a5-f5: empty (6), g5: black pawn (p), h5: empty (1). So black pawn on g5.\n- Rank 4 (4th rank from white's perspective): 4K3 \u2192 a4-d4: empty (4), e4: white king (K), f4-h4: empty (3). So white king on e4.\n- Rank 3 (3rd rank from white's perspective): 4P3 \u2192 a3-d3: empty (4), e3: white pawn (P), f3-h3: empty (3). So white pawn on e3.\n- Rank 2 (white's pawn rank): 8 empty squares (a2-h2: empty).\n- Rank 1 (white's back rank): 8 empty squares (a1-h1: empty).\n\nAh, okay, that's better. So coordinates:\n- White: K(e4), P(e3).\n- Black: K(f6), P(g5).\n- It's white's turn.\n\nNow, the legal moves for white are given as: e4d5, e4d4, e4f3, e4d3. Wait, those are all king moves! Because e4 is the square of white's king (since 4K3 on rank 4: yes, rank 4 is e4 for the king). Oh right! Because white's pawn is on e3 (4P3 on rank 3: e3), so the pawn on e3 can't move yet\u2014wait, why? Because pawns move forward: white pawns move from rank x to x+1 (since they are white). The pawn on e3 is on rank 3; to move forward, it would go to e4, but the white king is on e4! So the pawn can't move forward. Can it capture? To capture, it would need to move diagonally to d4 or f4, but those squares are empty (since rank 4 has 4K3: a4-d4 empty, e4 is king, f4-h4 empty). So the pawn on e3 has no legal moves. That's why all the legal moves are king moves: white's king is on e4, so its legal moves are to adjacent squares that are not under attack by black, and not putting the king in check.\n\nWait, but why are those the legal moves? Let's confirm: white's king is on e4. The adjacent squares are:\n- d3 (left-down), d4 (left), d5 (left-up), e3 (down), e5 (up), f3 (right-down), f4 (right), f5 (right-up).\n\nNow, which of these are legal? A king can't move into check, so we need to see which of these squares are under attack by black's pieces (black's king on f6 and pawn on g5).\n\nFirst, black's king on f6: what squares does it attack? The adjacent squares to f6: e5, e6, f5, f7, g5, g6. So black's king attacks e5, e6, f5, f7, g5, g6.\n\nBlack's pawn on g5: it's a black pawn, so it moves from rank 5 to 4 (since black pawns move down), and captures diagonally to f4 and h4. So black's pawn on g5 attacks f4 and h4.\n\nNow, white's king is on e4. Let's check each adjacent square for the king:\n\n1. d3: Is d3 under attack by black? Black's king is on f6: does it attack d3? No, because the king's attack is only adjacent. Black's pawn is on g5: does it attack d3? No, because a pawn's attack is diagonal one square forward (for black, forward is down, so from g5, it attacks f4 and h4). So d3 is not under attack by black. Is d3 occupied? No (rank 3 has 4P3: e3 is white's pawn, so d3 is empty). So moving to d3 is a legal king move. That's one of the given legal moves: e4d3.\n\n2. d4: Is d4 under attack by black? Black's king on f6: no. Black's pawn on g5: does it attack d4? No, pawn on g5 attacks f4 and h4. So d4 is safe. Is d4 occupied? No (rank 4 has 4K3: e4 is king, so d4 is empty). So e4d4 is legal (given).\n\n3. d5: Is d5 under attack by black? Black's king on f6: no (adjacent to f6 are e5, e6, f5, f7, g5, g6\u2014d5 is not adjacent). Black's pawn on g5: no. Is d5 occupied? No (rank 5 has 6p1: g5 is pawn, so d5 is empty). So e4d5 is legal (given).\n\n4. e3: Is e3 under attack by black? Black's king on f6: no. Black's pawn on g5: no. But wait, e3 is occupied by white's own pawn! The king can't move into a square occupied by a friendly piece. So e3 is not a legal move. That's why e3 is not in the list of legal moves.\n\n5. e5: Is e5 under attack by black? Black's king on f6: yes! Because black's king is on f6, which is adjacent to e5 (f6 is to the right and up from e5). So e5 is under attack by black's king. The king can't move into check, so e5 is not a legal move.\n\n6. f3: Is f3 under attack by black? Black's king on f6: no. Black's pawn on g5: does it attack f3? No, because a black pawn on g5 attacks f4 (diagonal down-left) and h4 (diagonal down-right). F3 is two squares down from g5, so no. Is f3 occupied? No (rank 3 has 4P3: e3 is pawn, so f3 is empty). So f3 is safe. So moving to f3 is legal: e4f3 (given).\n\n7. f4: Is f4 under attack by black? Yes! Black's pawn on g5 attacks f4 (since it's a black pawn, it captures diagonally to f4). So f4 is under attack by black's pawn. The king can't move into check, so f4 is not legal.\n\n8. f5: Is f5 under attack by black? Yes! Black's king on f6 is adjacent to f5 (f6 is up from f5), so black's king attacks f5. Also, is f5 occupied? No, but even so, the king can't move there because it's under attack by black's king. So f5 is not legal.\n\nSo that's why the legal moves for white are the king moves to d3, d4, d5, f3 (since those are the adjacent squares not under attack by black, and not occupied by friendly pieces). The pawn on e3 can't move because it's blocked by the king on e4 (if it were to move forward to e4, but the king is there), and it can't capture because there's no piece on d4 or f4 (wait, no: the pawn on e3 is white, so it moves forward to e4 (but blocked by king), and captures diagonally to d4 or f4. But d4 and f4 are empty, so no capture moves. So yes, pawn has no legal moves, only king moves.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose the best move among e4d5, e4d4, e4f3, e4d3.\n\nFirst, let's understand the type of position. It's a king and pawn endgame. White has a pawn on e3, black has a pawn on g5. Both kings are in the center/middle. Let's count the material: white has a pawn, black has a pawn\u2014material is equal (1 pawn each). But wait, no: wait, white's pawn is on e3 (rank 3), black's pawn is on g5 (rank 5). So black's pawn is further advanced: it's on the 5th rank, while white's is on the 3rd. So black's pawn is closer to promotion (needs to get to rank 1 for black, since black pawns move down). Wait, no: black pawns move from rank 7 to 1, so a black pawn on g5 needs to get to g1 to promote. White's pawn on e3 needs to get to e8 to promote. So black's pawn is two steps away from promotion (g5\u2192g4\u2192g3\u2192g2\u2192g1: wait, no, g5 to g1 is four steps: g5\u2192g4 (rank 4), g4\u2192g3 (rank 3), g3\u2192g2 (rank 2), g2\u2192g1 (rank 1). So four moves for black's pawn to promote. White's pawn on e3 needs to get to e8: e3\u2192e4 (blocked by king now, but later), e4\u2192e5, e5\u2192e6, e6\u2192e7, e7\u2192e8: five moves. So black's pawn is more advanced. That's a problem for white, because if black's pawn promotes first, white will be in trouble (since a queen vs a pawn is a win for the queen).\n\nSo white's main goal here is to stop black's pawn from promoting, and ideally promote their own pawn. But how?\n\nFirst, let's look at the positions of the kings. Black's king is on f6, which is behind their pawn (g5). White's king is on e4, which is in front of their pawn (e3). The key in pawn endgames is king activity: the king that can get to the pawns first (either to support their own pawn or to stop the enemy's) has an advantage.\n\nLet's consider each candidate move:\n\n1. e4d5 (king moves to d5): Let's see where d5 is. D5 is on the 5th rank, left of e5. What's the effect of this move? The king moves to d5. Now, where can the king go next? From d5, the king can move to c4, c5, c6, d4, d6, e4, e5, e6. How does this help in stopping black's pawn? Black's pawn is on g5. To stop a pawn, the king needs to get in front of it (the \"square of the pawn\"). Wait, the square of the pawn: for a pawn on g5 (black, moving down to g1), the square is the area from g5 to g1, and the files to the left and right equal to the number of steps the pawn has to go. Wait, no, the square rule for a pawn moving towards promotion: the square is a rectangle from the pawn's current position to the promotion rank, and the king needs to be inside or able to reach the square before the pawn to stop it. Wait, let's calculate the square for black's pawn on g5. Since it's a black pawn, it moves down (from higher rank to lower rank), so it needs 4 moves to reach g1 (g5\u2192g4\u2192g3\u2192g2\u2192g1: 4 moves). The square of the pawn is the area bounded by the pawn's file (g), the promotion file (g), the pawn's rank (5) and the promotion rank (1). Wait, no, the correct square rule is: for a pawn moving forward (for white, up; for black, down), the square is a square (or rectangle) where the pawn is at one corner, and the promotion rank is the opposite corner. The king needs to be able to reach the square before the pawn to stop it. Wait, maybe a better way: let's count how many moves it takes for each king to reach the black pawn's path.\n\nBlack's pawn on g5 will move to g4, g3, g2, g1. So its path is g5\u2192g4\u2192g3\u2192g2\u2192g1.\n\nWhite's king: where is it after each move?\n\nIf white plays e4d5 (king to d5):\n\n- White's king on d5. Now, how many moves does it take to reach g4 (the next square of black's pawn)? From d5 to g4: let's count steps. The king can move one square at a time, so the minimum number of moves is the maximum of the file difference and rank difference. File difference: d to g is 3 (d\u2192e\u2192f\u2192g). Rank difference: 5 to 4 is 1. So maximum is 3 moves. So white's king can reach g4 in 3 moves.\n\nBlack's pawn on g5: how many moves to reach g4? 1 move (g5\u2192g4). Then from g4 to g3: 1 move, etc. So if white's king is on d5, black's pawn can move to g4 on the next turn (black's turn), then white's king moves to e4 (or f5?), but wait, let's think about the sequence after 1. Ke4-d5:\n\n1. Ke4-d5. Now it's black's turn. What can black do? Black has a king on f6 and pawn on g5. Black's legal moves: king can move to adjacent squares (e5, e6, f5, f7, g5, g6), and pawn can move to g4 (since it's a black pawn, moving down from g5 to g4; no capture, since g4 is empty). What's black's best move? To advance the pawn, of course. So 1... g5-g4. Now it's white's turn. White's king is on d5, black's pawn on g4, black's king on f6. What can white do? White's king can move towards the pawn: d5-e4 (to get closer to g4). 2. Kd5-e4. Black's turn: 2... g4-g3 (advancing the pawn again). Now white's king is on e4, black's pawn on g3. White's turn: 3. Ke4-f3 (now the king is next to the pawn; this is called \"blocking\" the pawn). Ah, okay, so if white's king moves to f3, it blocks the pawn from moving further (since the pawn is on g3, and to move to g2, it needs to go forward, but the white king is on f3\u2014wait, no, the pawn is on g3 (black), so it moves to g2 (forward). The white king is on f3: is g2 under attack by the white king? Yes, but the pawn can move to g2 anyway, unless the square is occupied. Wait, no: the pawn on g3 (black) can move to g2 (since it's a forward move, no capture). The white king is on f3, which is adjacent to g2, but that doesn't stop the pawn from moving. Wait, no\u2014let's correct that. If white's king is on f3, and black's pawn is on g3, then the pawn can move to g2 (because it's a black pawn, moving from rank 3 to 2, which is forward). The white king is on f3, which is on the same rank as the pawn (rank 3), but the pawn's path is g3\u2192g2. The white king is on f3, so it's not blocking the pawn's path (the pawn is on g3, moving to g2; the king is on f3, which is to the left of the pawn). Wait, I made a mistake: blocking a pawn means the king is in front of the pawn, on the same file. For example, if the pawn is on g3, a king on g2 would block it (since the pawn can't move to g2 if it's occupied). A king on f3 is not blocking the pawn; the pawn can move to g2 freely.\n\nAh, right. So let's go back to the sequence after 1. Ke4-d5:\n\n1. Ke4-d5 (white's move). Black's best move is to advance the pawn: 1... g5-g4 (black's move). Now white's turn: what's the best move? White's king is on d5, black's pawn on g4, black's king on f6. White needs to get the king to the pawn. The shortest path from d5 to g4 is d5\u2192e4\u2192f3\u2192g4 (3 moves). But black's pawn will move again on their next turn. So 2. Kd5-e4 (white's move, moving towards the pawn). Black's turn: 2... g4-g3 (advancing the pawn). Now white's king is on e4, black's pawn on g3. White's turn: 3. Ke4-f3 (moving closer). Black's turn: 3... g3-g2 (advancing the pawn). Now white's king is on f3, black's pawn on g2. White's turn: what can white do? The king can move to g2 (to capture the pawn?), but wait, is g2 under attack by black? Black's king is on f6: does it attack g2? No. Black's pawn is on g2: it's a black pawn, so it attacks f1 (diagonally down-left) and h1 (diagonally down-right). So g2 is not under attack by black (except the pawn is on g2, but the king can capture the pawn if it's on an adjacent square). Wait, white's king is on f3 (rank 3, f file). The pawn is on g2 (rank 2, g file). The king can move to g2 (since it's adjacent), and capturing the pawn is allowed (because the pawn is an enemy piece). Oh right! Because the king can capture enemy pieces as long as the square is not under attack by another enemy piece. So if white's king is on f3, and black's pawn is on g2, then the king can move to g2 and capture the pawn (since the square g2 is not under attack by any other black piece\u2014black's king is on f6, which is not attacking g2). So 4. Kf3-g2 (white's move, capturing the pawn: Kxg2). Ah, okay, so in that case, white captures the pawn. But wait, how many moves did that take? Let's count:\n\n1. Ke4-d5 (white) \u2192 1... g4 (black)\n2. Kd5-e4 (white) \u2192 2... g3 (black)\n3. Ke4-f3 (white) \u2192 3... g2 (black)\n4. Kf3-g2 (white, captures pawn: Kxg2)\n\nSo after 4 moves (2 white moves, 2 black moves), white captures the pawn. But what about black's king? Black's king was on f6 at the start. Let's see where black's king is during this sequence. After 1... g4, black's king is still on f6 (since black moved the pawn). After 2... g3, black's king is still on f6. After 3... g2, black's king is still on f6. Then white captures the pawn on g2. Now, after white captures the pawn, what's the position? White's king on g2, white's pawn on e3; black's king on f6, no pawns. So it's a king vs king and pawn endgame? Wait no: white has a pawn on e3, black has no pawns. So it's white with king on g2 and pawn on e3; black with king on f6. Is that a win for white?\n\nWait, but let's think: if white captures black's pawn, then white has a pawn advantage (1 pawn vs 0). But can white promote the pawn? Let's see. After capturing the pawn on g2, it's black's turn (since white just moved 4. Kf3-g2). Black's king is on f6. What will black do? Black will move the king towards white's pawn. For example, 4... Kf6-e5 (moving towards e3). Now white's turn: white's king is on g2, pawn on e3; black's king on e5. White needs to get the king to support the pawn. But the pawn is on e3, and black's king is already on e5 (which is two squares away from e3). White's king is on g2, which is far away. Let's see: 5. Kg2-f3 (white's move, moving towards the pawn). Black's turn: 5... Ke5-d4 (moving towards the pawn). Now white's king is on f3, pawn on e3; black's king on d4. White's turn: 6. Kf3-e2 (moving to support the pawn). Black's turn: 6... Kd4-e5 (moving back? Or maybe 6... Kd4-d3, but wait, if black's king is on d4, can it move to d3? Yes, but white's pawn is on e3, so d3 is adjacent to the pawn. Wait, 6... Kd4-d3: now black's king is on d3, which is next to white's pawn on e3. White's turn: what can white do? The pawn is on e3; it can move to e4 (since it's white's pawn, moving forward), but black's king is on d3, which is adjacent to e4 (so e4 is under attack by black's king). Wait, no: if white's pawn is on e3, moving to e4 is a forward move (no capture). The square e4 is not under attack by black's king (black's king is on d3; e4 is one square up and one square right from d3, so it's not adjacent). Wait, black's king on d3: adjacent squares are c2, c3, c4, d2, d4, e2, e3, e4. Oh right! So black's king on d3 attacks e4 (since it's adjacent). So if white's pawn is on e3, moving to e4 would put it on a square attacked by black's king, but that's allowed (pawns can move to squares attacked by enemy pieces, as long as they are not occupied). Wait, no\u2014pawns can move forward to an empty square, even if it's under attack. The only time a pawn can't move is if the square is occupied (for a forward move) or if there's no enemy piece to capture (for a diagonal move). So white's pawn on e3 can move to e4 even if e4 is under attack by black's king. But if it does, then black's king can capture the pawn on e4. So 7. e3-e4 (white's move). Black's turn: 7... Kd3-e4 (capturing the pawn). Now it's a king vs king endgame, which is a draw. Oh, so that's a problem. Because if white captures black's pawn, but then black can capture white's pawn, it's a draw.\n\nSo that sequence after 1. Ke4-d5 leads to a draw? Because both pawns get captured, and it's a king vs king endgame.\n\nNow let's consider another candidate move: 1. Ke4-d4 (king moves to d4). What happens here?\n\n1. Ke4-d4 (white's move). Black's best move is to advance the pawn: 1... g5-g4 (black's move). Now white's king is on d4, black's pawn on g4, black's king on f6. White's turn: what's the best move? The king needs to get to the pawn. The shortest path from d4 to g4 is d4\u2192e3\u2192f3\u2192g4 (3 moves). But black's pawn will move again. So 2. Kd4-e3 (white's move, moving towards the pawn). Black's turn: 2... g4-g3 (advancing the pawn). Now white's king is on e3, black's pawn on g3. Wait, white's king is on e3 (rank 3, e file), and black's pawn is on g3 (rank 3, g file). Are they on the same rank? Yes, but the king is on e3, pawn on g3. Can the king move to g3? No, because it's two squares away (the king moves one square at a time). Wait, no\u2014white's king is on e3, black's pawn on g3. The king can move to f3 (adjacent to e3) on the next turn. Let's continue: 2. Kd4-e3 (white's move). Black's turn: 2... g4-g3 (black's move). Now white's king is on e3, black's pawn on g3, black's king on f6. White's turn: 3. Ke3-f3 (moving towards the pawn). Black's turn: 3... g3-g2 (advancing the pawn). Now white's king is on f3, black's pawn on g2. White's turn: 4. Kf3-g2 (capturing the pawn, same as before). Now the position is white's king on g2, pawn on e3; black's king on f6. Same as the previous sequence. Then black's turn: 4... Kf6-e5 (moving towards the pawn). White's turn: 5. Kg2-f3. Black's turn: 5... Ke5-d4. White's turn: 6. Kf3-e2. Black's turn: 6... Kd4-d3. White's turn: 7. e3-e4. Black's turn: 7... Kd3-e4. Draw. So same result as 1. Ke4-d5: draw.\n\nNow let's consider the third candidate move: 1. Ke4-f3 (king moves to f3). What happens here?\n\nFirst, let's see where f3 is. F3 is on rank 3, f file. White's king moves from e4 (rank 4, e file) to f3 (rank 3, f file). Now, what's the position after 1. Ke4-f3? White's king on f3, pawn on e3; black's king on f6, pawn on g5.\n\nBlack's turn: what's the best move? Again, black will advance the pawn: 1... g5-g4 (black's move). Now white's king is on f3, black's pawn on g4, black's king on f6. White's turn: what can white do? The king is on f3, and the pawn is on g4 (which is adjacent to f3: g4 is up-right from f3). Oh! Wait, the king is on f3, and the pawn is on g4 (rank 4, g file). The king can move to g4 and capture the pawn! Because g4 is adjacent to f3, and the pawn is an enemy piece. Is g4 under attack by black? Black's king is on f6: does it attack g4? No (f6 is two squares up from g4). Black's pawn is on g4: it's an enemy piece, so the king can capture it.\n\nWait, that's a big difference! Because if white's king is on f3, and black's pawn moves to g4, then white's king can capture the pawn immediately on the next turn. Let's go through the sequence step by step:\n\n1. Ke4-f3 (white's move). Black's best move is to advance the pawn: 1... g5-g4 (black's move). Now it's white's turn. White's king is on f3 (rank 3, f file), black's pawn is on g4 (rank 4, g file). The king can move to g4 (since it's adjacent) and capture the pawn. Is there any reason why white can't do that? Let's check: is g4 under attack by black's other pieces? Black's only other piece is the king on f6. Does the black king on f6 attack g4? Let's see: the black king is on f6 (rank 6, f file). The square g4 (rank 4, g file) is two ranks down and one file to the right from f6. The king can only attack adjacent squares, so no\u2014black's king does not attack g4. So the square g4 is safe for white's king to move into, and since there's an enemy pawn on g4, the king can capture it.\n\nSo white's next move is 2. Kf3-g4 (white's move, capturing the black pawn on g4). Now, what's the position after 2. Kf3-g4? White's pieces: king on g4 (rank 4, g file), pawn on e3 (rank 3, e file). Black's pieces: king on f6 (rank 6, f file), no pawns (since the pawn on g4 was captured). \n\nAh! That's a huge difference from the previous sequences. Because in this case, white captures the black pawn in just two moves (white's first move to f3, black's move to g4, white's second move to capture), whereas in the previous sequences, it took four moves to capture the pawn. Why? Because moving the king to f3 puts it in a position where, when black advances the pawn to g4, the king is adjacent to the pawn and can capture it immediately. \n\nNow, let's analyze this new position. It's black's turn (since white just moved 2. Kf3-g4). Black's only piece is the king on f6. White has a king on g4 and a pawn on e3. Material-wise, white is up a pawn (1 pawn vs 0), which is a winning advantage in king and pawn endgames if the pawn can be promoted. \n\nNow, black's goal is to stop white's pawn from promoting. Black's king is on f6, which is on the same file as white's king (f file) but two ranks higher. White's pawn is on e3, which is on the e file, three ranks away from promotion (e3\u2192e4\u2192e5\u2192e6\u2192e7\u2192e8: five moves, but wait, no\u2014e3 to e8 is five moves? No, e3 to e4 is one move, e4 to e5 is two, e5 to e6 three, e6 to e7 four, e7 to e8 five. So five moves to promote. But white's king is on g4, which is close to the pawn, and can support it. \n\nBlack's king is on f6. What's the best move for black? They need to move towards white's pawn. The shortest path from f6 to e3 is f6\u2192e5\u2192d4\u2192e3 (wait, no, let's calculate the shortest path from f6 to e3. The file difference is f to e: 1. The rank difference is 6 to 3: 3. So the shortest path is 3 moves (since the maximum of 1 and 3 is 3). For example: f6\u2192e5 (move 1), e5\u2192d4 (move 2), d4\u2192e3 (move 3). But white's king is on g4, which is closer to the pawn. Let's go through the sequence step by step:\n\nAfter 2. Kf3-g4 (white's move, capturing the pawn), it's black's turn:\n\n2... Kf6-e5 (black's move, moving towards white's pawn on e3). Now it's white's turn. White's king is on g4, pawn on e3; black's king on e5. What's white's best move? White needs to get the king to support the pawn. The pawn is on e3, so the king should move towards the e file. The best move is 3. Kg4-f3 (white's move, moving from g4 to f3\u2014rank 3, f file). Why? Because f3 is closer to the pawn (e3) and to the path of black's king (e5\u2192d4\u2192e3). \n\nBlack's turn: 3... Ke5-d4 (black's move, moving towards the pawn). Now white's turn: 4. Kf3-e2 (white's move, moving to e2\u2014rank 2, e file. This is a key move because it puts the king in front of the pawn, which is the correct way to support a pawn in a king and pawn endgame (called \"opposition\" or \"king in front\"). Now the position is: white's king on e2, pawn on e3; black's king on d4. \n\nBlack's turn: what can black do? The king is on d4 (rank 4, d file). The adjacent squares are c3, c4, c5, d3, d5, e3, e4, e5. But black's king can't move to e3 because that's where white's pawn is (occupied by a friendly piece? No, it's occupied by an enemy pawn, but the king can't move to a square occupied by any piece, friendly or enemy. Wait, no\u2014king can move to a square occupied by an enemy piece only if it's a capture, but the square must not be under attack by another enemy piece. But white's pawn is on e3, which is an enemy piece. Can black's king on d4 move to e3? Let's see: e3 is adjacent to d4 (yes). Is e3 under attack by white's pieces? White's king is on e2 (rank 2, e file). The white king on e2 attacks e3 (since it's adjacent). So if black's king moves to e3, it would be moving into check (because the white king on e2 attacks e3). So black's king can't move to e3. \n\nSo black's options are to move to c3, c4, c5, d3, d5, e4, e5. What's the best move? Let's say 4... Kd4-d3 (black's move, moving to d3\u2014rank 3, d file). Now white's turn: 5. Ke2-e3 (white's move, moving the king to e3\u2014rank 3, e file. Wait, but the pawn is on e3! Oh no, I made a mistake: white's pawn is on e3, so the king can't move to e3 (since it's occupied by a friendly piece). Oh right! I forgot that white's pawn is on e3. So white's king is on e2 (rank 2, e file), and the pawn is on e3 (rank 3, e file). So the king can't move to e3 because it's occupied by the pawn. So what's white's best move instead of 4. Kf3-e2? Wait, no\u2014let's go back to move 3. After 2... Ke5 (black's move), white's turn: 3. Kg4-f3 (white's move). Then black's move: 3... Ke5-d4 (black's move). Now white's turn: what's the best move? White's king is on f3 (rank 3, f file), pawn on e3 (rank 3, e file). Black's king is on d4 (rank 4, d file). White's best move is to move the king to e4 (rank 4, e file). Why? Because e4 is in front of the pawn (e3) and blocks black's king from advancing further. Let's correct the sequence:\n\n2. Kf3-g4 (white captures pawn). Black's move: 2... Kf6-e5 (moving towards pawn). White's move: 3. Kg4-f4 (wait, no\u2014from g4, the king can move to f3, f4, f5, g3, g5, h3, h4, h5. Oh, I made a mistake earlier: 2. Kf3-g4 is white's move, so the king is on g4 (rank 4, g file). Oh right! Because g4 is rank 4 (since it's the 4th rank from white's perspective). I messed up the rank of g4 earlier. That's a critical mistake. \n\nOh my goodness, I need to correct that. Let's go back to the position after 1. Ke4-f3 (white's move):\n\n- White's king: moved from e4 (rank 4, e file) to f3 (rank 3, f file). Correct.\n- Black's pawn: on g5 (rank 5, g file). Correct.\n- Black's king: on f6 (rank 6, f file). Correct.\n\nSo 1. Ke4-f3 (white's move) is from e4 (rank 4) to f3 (rank 3). Now, black's move: 1... g5-g4 (black's pawn moves from g5 (rank 5) to g4 (rank 4). Correct. Now, white's turn: white's king is on f3 (rank 3, f file), black's pawn is on g4 (rank 4, g file). Oh! Oh right! Rank 4 is higher than rank 3. So g4 is one rank above f3. So the king is on f3 (rank 3), and the pawn is on g4 (rank 4). The king can move to g4 (since it's adjacent: f3 to g4 is one square up and one square to the right\u2014yes, that's a legal king move). And capturing the pawn is allowed because the pawn is an enemy piece. And is g4 under attack by black's other pieces? Black's only other piece is the king on f6 (rank 6, f file). The black king on f6 is on rank 6, which is two ranks above g4 (rank 4). The king can only attack adjacent squares, so f6 does not attack g4. So yes, white's king can move to g4 and capture the pawn. \n\nBut here's the key correction: g4 is rank 4, so when black's pawn moves from g5 (rank 5) to g4 (rank 4), it's moving one square forward (since black's pawns move down from higher ranks to lower ranks). So g4 is a lower rank than g5 (since rank 1 is the lowest, rank 8 is the highest). Oh my God, I had the rank order backwards this whole time! That's a huge mistake. That changes everything. \n\nLet's re-parse the FEN correctly, because this is critical. FEN notation uses standard algebraic notation, where:\n- Rank 1 is the first rank (white's home rank, where white's king is on e1 initially).\n- Rank 2 is the second rank (white's pawn rank, where white's pawns are on e2 initially).\n- Rank 7 is the seventh rank (black's pawn rank, where black's pawns are on e7 initially).\n- Rank 8 is the eighth rank (black's home rank, where black's king is on e8 initially).\n\nSo when a pawn is on rank 5, it's closer to promotion for black (since black's pawns move from rank 7 to rank 1) than for white (since white's pawns move from rank 2 to rank 8). For example:\n- A black pawn on g5 needs to move to g4 (rank 4), g3 (rank 3), g2 (rank 2), g1 (rank 1) to promote. That's 4 moves.\n- A white pawn on e3 needs to move to e4 (rank 4), e5 (rank 5), e6 (rank 6), e7 (rank 7), e8 (rank 8) to promote. That's 5 moves.\n\nSo when black's pawn is on g5 (rank 5), it's 4 moves away from promotion. When it moves to g4 (rank 4), it's 3 moves away. \n\nNow, going back to the sequence after 1. Ke4-f3 (white's move):\n\n1. Ke4-f3 (white's king moves from e4 (rank 4, e) to f3 (rank 3, f)). Correct.\n2. ... g5-g4 (black's pawn moves from g5 (rank 5, g) to g4 (rank 4, g)). Correct. Now it's white's turn.\n\nWhite's king is on f3 (rank 3, f). Black's pawn is on g4 (rank 4, g). The king can move to g4 (rank 4, g) because:\n- It's adjacent (f3 to g4 is one square up (rank 3\u21924) and one square right (f\u2192g)).\n- The square g4 is occupied by an enemy piece (black's pawn), so the king can capture it.\n- The square g4 is not under attack by any other enemy piece (black's only other piece is the king on f6 (rank 6, f), which is not adjacent to g4 (since f6 is two ranks above g4 (rank 4), so the distance is too far\u2014king can only attack adjacent squares).\n\nSo white's move is 2. Kf3-g4 (white's king captures black's pawn on g4). Now, what's the position after 2. Kf3-g4?\n\n- White's pieces: King on g4 (rank 4, g), Pawn on e3 (rank 3, e).\n- Black's pieces: King on f6 (rank 6, f), no pawns (since the pawn on g4 was captured).\n- It's black's turn (since white just moved).\n\nAh! Now this is a completely different position than I thought earlier. Because white's king is on g4 (rank 4), which is much closer to their pawn on e3 (rank 3) than I previously thought (I had mistakenly put the king on g2 earlier, but no\u2014g4 is rank 4, e3 is rank 3, so the king is just one rank above the pawn). And black's king is on f6 (rank 6), which is two ranks above white's king (rank 4). \n\nNow, this is a king and pawn endgame where white has a pawn advantage (1 pawn vs 0). The key question is: can white promote the pawn to a queen, or will black's king be able to stop it?\n\nIn king and pawn endgames, the general rule is that if the king can get in front of the pawn (i.e., on the same file as the pawn, but beyond it towards the promotion rank), then the pawn can be promoted. Let's see:\n\nWhite's pawn is on e3 (rank 3, e). To promote, it needs to reach e8 (rank 8, e). The king is on g4 (rank 4, g). Black's king is on f6 (rank 6, f). \n\nBlack's best move is to try to stop the pawn. The shortest path from black's king on f6 (rank 6, f) to the pawn on e3 (rank 3, e) is:\n\n- f6\u2192e5 (rank 5, e) (move 1)\n- e5\u2192d4 (rank 4, d) (move 2)\n- d4\u2192e3 (rank 3, e) (move 3)\n\nBut wait, can black's king reach e3 before white's king can support the pawn? Let's see:\n\nWhite's king is on g4 (rank 4, g). The pawn is on e3 (rank 3, e). The king can move to e4 (rank 4, e) in one move, which is in front of the pawn (since e4 is rank 4, e3 is rank 3). That's the correct way to support the pawn: the king should get in front of the pawn to block the enemy king from attacking it. \n\nLet's go through the sequence step by step, starting from after 2. Kf3-g4 (white's move, capturing the pawn):\n\n2... Kf6-e5 (black's move, moving from f6 (rank 6, f) to e5 (rank 5, e)\u2014this is the shortest path towards white's pawn on e3). Now it's white's turn. What's white's best move? White needs to get their king to support the pawn. The pawn is on e3 (rank 3, e), so the king should move towards the e file. The best move is 3. Kg4-f4 (white's king moves from g4 (rank 4, g) to f4 (rank 4, f)\u2014this is moving towards the e file and also towards the black king, which is on e5 (rank 5, e)). Why? Because moving to f4 puts the king in a position to block black's king from advancing further towards the pawn. \n\nBlack's turn: 3... Ke5-d5 (black's king moves from e5 (rank 5, e) to d5 (rank 5, d)\u2014trying to go around white's king to reach the pawn). White's turn: 4. Kf4-e4 (white's king moves from f4 (rank 4, f) to e4 (rank 4, e)\u2014this is a critical move because it puts the king in front of the pawn (e4 is rank 4, e3 is rank 3) and establishes \"opposition\" against black's king on d5 (rank 5, d). Opposition is when two kings are on the same file or rank with one square between them\u2014this forces the enemy king to move away, allowing your king to advance. \n\nBlack's turn: 4... Kd5-c5 (black's king has to move away from the e file because of the opposition\u2014if they move to d4, white's king can move to e5, which is even better). White's turn: 5. Ke4-e5 (white's king moves from e4 (rank 4, e) to e5 (rank 5, e)\u2014advancing towards the promotion rank). Black's turn: 5... Kc5-d5 (black's king tries to block white's king, but now white has \"distant opposition\"). White's turn: 6. Ke5-e6 (white's king moves to e6 (rank 6, e)\u2014advancing further). Black's turn: 6... Kd5-d6 (black's king moves to d6 (rank 6, d)\u2014trying to block). White's turn: 7. Ke6-e7 (white's king moves to e7 (rank 7, e)\u2014now the king is on the seventh rank, right in front of the pawn, which is on e3 (rank 3)). Black's turn: 7... Kd6-d7 (black's king moves to d7 (rank 7, d)\u2014trying to block, but it's too late). White's turn: 8. e3-e4 (white's pawn moves from e3 (rank 3, e) to e4 (rank 4, e)\u2014now the pawn is advancing, supported by the king on e7). Black's turn: 8... Kd7-d6 (black's king moves back, but there's nothing they can do to stop the pawn now). White's turn: 9. e4-e5 (pawn advances to e5 (rank 5, e)). Black's turn: 9... Kd6-d5 (black's king moves to d5 (rank 5, d), but the pawn is on e5, so the king can't capture it (since it's on a different file)). White's turn: 10. e5-e6 (pawn advances to e6 (rank 6, e)). Black's turn: 10... Kd5-d6 (black's king moves to d6 (rank 6, d), but again, can't capture the pawn). White's turn: 11. e6-e7 (pawn advances to e7 (rank 7, e)\u2014now the pawn is on the seventh rank, and the king is on e7 (rank 7, e), so the king is blocking the pawn, but wait\u2014no, the pawn is on e7 (rank 7), and the king is on e7 (rank 7)\u2014that's the same square! Oh no, I made a mistake in the sequence. The pawn is on e3 (rank 3), so when white moves the king to e7 (rank 7), the pawn is still on e3 (rank 3). I forgot to move the pawn earlier! \n\nOh my goodness, I need to correct that. The pawn is on e3 (rank 3), so it can't move until white decides to move it. The correct sequence should involve white moving the king to support the pawn, then moving the pawn forward once the king is in a good position. Let's start over from the position after 2. Kf3-g4 (white's king on g4 (rank 4, g), pawn on e3 (rank 3, e); black's king on f6 (rank 6, f)):\n\n2... Kf6-e5 (black's move). White's move: 3. Kg4-f4 (white's king moves to f4 (rank 4, f)\u2014this is a good move because it's in the direction of both the pawn (e3) and the black king (e5)). Black's move: 3... Ke5-d5 (black's king moves to d5 (rank 5, d)). White's move: 4. Kf4-e4 (white's king moves to e4 (rank 4, e)\u2014now the king is on the same file as the pawn (e3) and is one rank above it. This is perfect because the king can now support the pawn as it advances). Black's move: 4... Kd5-c5 (black's king moves away). White's move: 5. e3-e4 (white's pawn moves from e3 (rank 3, e) to e4 (rank 4, e)\u2014now the pawn is on e4, and the king is on e4 (rank 4, e)\u2014wait, no! The king is on e4 (rank 4, e), so the pawn can't move to e4 (since it's occupied by the king). Oh right! I forgot that the king is on e4. So white's move 4. Kf4-e4 (rank 4, e) means the king is on e4 (rank 4), and the pawn is on e3 (rank 3). So the pawn can't move to e4 until the king moves away. That's a mistake in the sequence. \n\nLet's correct that. After 4. Kf4-e4 (white's king on e4 (rank 4, e), pawn on e3 (rank 3, e); black's king on d5 (rank 5, d)), white's best move is not to move the pawn yet, but to move the king forward. So 5. Ke4-e5 (white's king moves to e5 (rank 5, e)). Black's move: 5... Kd5-c5 (black's king moves to c5 (rank 5, c)). White's move: 6. Ke5-e6 (white's king moves to e6 (rank 6, e)). Black's move: 6... Kc5-d6 (black's king moves to d6 (rank 6, d)). White's move: 7. Ke6-e7 (white's king moves to e7 (rank 7, e)). Black's move: 7... Kd6-d7 (black's king moves to d7 (rank 7, d)). White's move: 8. e3-e4 (white's pawn moves to e4 (rank 4, e)\u2014now the pawn is on e4, and the king is on e7 (rank 7, e), so there's no conflict). Black's move: 8... Kd7-d6 (black's king moves to d6 (rank 6, d)). White's move: 9. e4-e5+ (white's pawn moves to e5 (rank 5, e)\u2014this is a check because the pawn is on e5, and the black king is on d6 (rank 6, d)\u2014wait, no, a pawn can only give check if it's capturing a piece on a square that's adjacent to the king. The pawn is on e5 (rank 5, e), and the black king is on d6 (rank 6, d). The pawn is not attacking the king, so it's not a check. But regardless, the pawn is advancing. Black's move: 9... Kd6-d5 (black's king moves to d5 (rank 5, d)). White's move: 10. e5-e6 (pawn advances to e6 (rank 6, e)). Black's move: 10... Kd5-d6 (black's king moves to d6 (rank 6, d)). White's move: 11. e6-e7 (pawn advances to e7 (rank 7, e)). Black's move: 11... Kd6-d7 (black's king moves to d7 (rank 7, d)). White's move: 12. Ke7-f7 (white's king moves to f7 (rank 7, f)\u2014moving out of the way so the pawn can promote). Black's move: 12... Kd7-e7 (black's king moves to e7 (rank 7, e)\u2014trying to capture the pawn, but wait, the pawn is on e7 (rank 7, e), so the king can't move to e7 (since it's occupied by the pawn). Oh right! The pawn is on e7 (rank 7, e), so black's king can't move to e7. So black's move: 12... Kd7-d8 (black's king moves to d8 (rank 8, d)). White's move: 13. e7-e8=Q (white's pawn promotes to a queen on e8 (rank 8, e)). Now white has a queen and a king, black has a king. This is a winning position for white, as a queen vs king is a forced checkmate. \n\nAh! There we go. So the key difference with the move 1. Ke4-f3 is that white can capture black's pawn in just two moves (1. Ke4-f3, 2. Kf3-g4), which leaves white with a pawn advantage. And because white's king is on g4 (rank 4) after capturing the pawn, it's close enough to their own pawn (e3, rank 3) to support it as it advances to promotion. Whereas the other moves (e4d5, e4d4, e4d3) result in white capturing the pawn too late, allowing black's king to reach white's pawn and capture it, leading to a draw. \n\nNow, let's confirm why the other moves are worse. Take the move 1. Ke4-d3 (king moves to d3 (rank 3, d)):\n\n1. Ke4-d3 (white's move). Black's move: 1... g5-g4 (black's pawn moves to g4 (rank 4, g)). White's move: 2. Kd3-e4 (white's king moves back to e4 (rank 4, e)). Black's move: 2... g4-g3 (black's pawn moves to g3 (rank 3, g)). White's move: 3. Ke4-f3 (white's king moves to f3 (rank 3, f)). Black's move: 3... g3-g2 (black's pawn moves to g2 (rank 2, g)). White's move: 4. Kf3-g2 (white's king captures the pawn on g2 (rank 2, g)). Now the position is white's king on g2 (rank 2, g), pawn on e3 (rank 3, e); black's king on f6 (rank 6, f). Black's move: 4... Kf6-e5 (black's king moves towards the pawn). White's move: 5. Kg2-f3 (white's king moves towards the pawn). Black's move: 5... Ke5-d4 (black's king moves to d4 (rank 4, d)). White's move: 6. Kf3-e2 (white's king moves to e2 (rank 2, e)). Black's move: 6... Kd4-e5 (black's king moves back to e5 (rank 5, e)). White's move: 7. Ke2-f3 (white's king moves back to f3 (rank 3, f)). Black's move: 7... Ke5-d4 (black's king moves back to d4 (rank 4, d)). This is a \"zugzwang\" situation for white, but eventually, black's king will capture white's pawn, leading to a draw. \n\nThe move 1. Ke4-d5 (king moves to d5 (rank 5, d)) is even worse because it takes the king further away from white's pawn, allowing black's pawn to advance more quickly. For example:\n\n1. Ke4-d5 (white's move). Black's move: 1... g5-g4 (black's pawn moves to g4 (rank 4, g)). White's move: 2. Kd5-e4 (white's king moves back to e4 (rank 4, e)). Black's move: 2... g4-g3 (black's pawn moves to g3 (rank 3, g)). White's move: 3. Ke4-f3 (white's king moves to f3 (rank 3, f)). Black's move: 3... g3-g2 (black's pawn moves to g2 (rank 2, g)). White's move: 4. Kf3-g2 (white's king captures the pawn on g2 (rank 2, g)). Now the position is white's king on g2 (rank 2, g), pawn on e3 (rank 3, e); black's king on f6 (rank 6, f). Black's move: 4... Kf6-e5 (black's king moves towards the pawn). White's move: 5. Kg2-f3 (white's king moves towards the pawn). Black's move: 5... Ke5-d4 (black's king moves to d4 (rank 4, d)). White's move: 6. Kf3-e2 (white's king moves to e2 (rank 2, e)). Black's move: 6... Kd4-e5 (black's king moves back to e5 (rank 5, e)). White's move: 7. Ke2-f3 (white's king moves back to f3 (rank 3, f)). Black's move: 7... Ke5-d4 (black's king moves back to d4 (rank 4, d)). Again, this leads to a draw because black's king can capture white's pawn before it can promote. \n\nThe move 1. Ke4-f3 (king moves to f3 (rank 3, f)) is the only move that allows white to capture black's pawn quickly (in two moves) and keep their king close enough to support their own pawn as it advances to promotion. All other moves result in white capturing black's pawn too late, allowing black's king to reach white's pawn and capture it, leading to a draw. \n\nTherefore, the best move is 1. Ke4-f3, which in UCI notation is e4f3.\nTo solve this problem, we analyze the given chess position (FEN: `8/8/5k2/6p1/4K3/4P3/8/8 w - - 1 58`) and evaluate the legal moves for White (king moves to `d5`, `d4`, `f3`, or `d3`). The goal is to determine the best move that maximizes White's chances of winning or avoiding a draw.\n\n\n### **Step 1: Parse the Position**\n- **White**: King on `e4` (rank 4, e-file), Pawn on `e3` (rank 3, e-file).  \n- **Black**: King on `f6` (rank 6, f-file), Pawn on `g5` (rank 5, g-file).  \n- **Key Observations**:  \n  - Black's pawn on `g5` is more advanced (4 moves from promotion) than White's pawn on `e3` (5 moves from promotion).  \n  - White must stop Black's pawn from promoting while supporting their own pawn to advance.  \n\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Legal Moves**\nWhite's only legal moves are king moves (the pawn on `e3` is blocked by the king and has no capture options). We analyze each candidate move:\n\n#### **Move 1: `e4d5` (King to `d5`)**\n- **Sequence**:  \n  1. `Ke4-d5` (White moves king to `d5`).  \n  2. `...g5-g4` (Black advances pawn to `g4`).  \n  3. `Kd5-e4` (White moves king back to `e4`).  \n  4. `...g4-g3` (Black advances pawn to `g3`).  \n  5. `Ke4-f3` (White moves king to `f3`).  \n  6. `...g3-g2` (Black advances pawn to `g2`).  \n  7. `Kf3-g2` (White captures pawn on `g2`).  \n- **Outcome**: White captures Black's pawn but their king is far from their own pawn (`e3`). Black's king reaches `e3` and captures White's pawn, leading to a **draw**.\n\n#### **Move 2: `e4d4` (King to `d4`)**\n- **Sequence**:  \n  1. `Ke4-d4` (White moves king to `d4`).  \n  2. `...g5-g4` (Black advances pawn to `g4`).  \n  3. `Kd4-e3` (White moves king to `e3`).  \n  4. `...g4-g3` (Black advances pawn to `g3`).  \n  5. `Ke3-f3` (White moves king to `f3`).  \n  6. `...g3-g2` (Black advances pawn to `g2`).  \n  7. `Kf3-g2` (White captures pawn on `g2`).  \n- **Outcome**: Identical to `e4d5`\u2014Black's king captures White's pawn, resulting in a **draw**.\n\n#### **Move 3: `e4f3` (King to `f3`)**\n- **Sequence**:  \n  1. `Ke4-f3` (White moves king to `f3`\u2014rank 3, f-file).  \n  2. `...g5-g4` (Black advances pawn to `g4`\u2014rank 4, g-file).  \n  3. `Kf3-g4` (White's king captures Black's pawn on `g4`\u2014rank 4, g-file).  \n- **Outcome**: White eliminates Black's pawn early (in 2 moves) and keeps their king close to their own pawn (`e3`). Black's king is on `f6` (rank 6), far from White's pawn. White's king can now support their pawn as it advances to promotion.  \n  - **Subsequent Play**: White's king advances to `e4`, `e5`, `e6`, and `e7` (supporting the pawn). Black's king cannot block White's pawn effectively, allowing White to promote the pawn to a queen and win.\n\n#### **Move 4: `e4d3` (King to `d3`)**\n- **Sequence**:  \n  1. `Ke4-d3` (White moves king to `d3`\u2014rank 3, d-file).  \n  2. `...g5-g4` (Black advances pawn to `g4`\u2014rank 4, g-file).  \n  3. `Kd3-e4` (White moves king back to `e4`).  \n  4. `...g4-g3` (Black advances pawn to `g3`\u2014rank 3, g-file).  \n  5. `Ke4-f3` (White moves king to `f3`).  \n  6. `...g3-g2` (Black advances pawn to `g2`\u2014rank 2, g-file).  \n  7. `Kf3-g2` (White captures pawn on `g2`).  \n- **Outcome**: White captures Black's pawn but their king is too far from their own pawn (`e3`). Black's king reaches `e3` and captures White's pawn, leading to a **draw**.\n\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe move `e4f3` (king to `f3`) is the best option. It allows White to capture Black's pawn early and keep their king close to their own pawn, enabling them to support the pawn's advance to promotion. All other moves result in White capturing Black's pawn too late, allowing Black's king to capture White's pawn and force a draw.\n\n\n```\ne4f3\n```"
