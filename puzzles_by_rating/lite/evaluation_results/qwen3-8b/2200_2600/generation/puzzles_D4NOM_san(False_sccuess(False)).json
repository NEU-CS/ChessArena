When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The FEN notation is:\n\n```\nr1b2k1r/pppp1B2/5n2/2q1p1B1/3nP3/8/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 13\n```\n\nThis means it's White's turn to move, and the position is as follows:\n\n- **White's pieces**:\n  - Rook on e1\n  - Knight on b1\n  - Bishop on c1\n  - Queen on d1\n  - Pawn on d2, e2, f2, g2, h2\n  - Pawn on d3, e3, f3, g3, h3\n  - Pawn on d4, e4, f4, g4, h4\n  - Pawn on d5, e5, f5, g5, h5\n  - Pawn on d6, e6, f6, g6, h6\n  - Pawn on d7, e7, f7, g7, h7\n  - Pawn on d8, e8, f8, g8, h8\n\n- **Black's pieces**:\n  - Rook on a8\n  - Knight on b8\n  - Bishop on c8\n  - Queen on d8\n  - Pawn on a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7\n  - Pawn on a6, b6, c6, d6, e6, f6, g6, h6\n  - Pawn on a5, b5, c5, d5, e5, f5, g5, h5\n  - Pawn on a4, b4, c4, d4, e4, f4, g4, h4\n  - Pawn on a3, b3, c3, d3, e3, f3, g3, h3\n  - Pawn on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2\n  - Pawn on a1, b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, h1\n\nFrom the legal moves provided, we can see that the most promising moves for White are those that aim to develop the pieces, control the center, and create threats. Let's evaluate the most critical moves:\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n1. **g5h6** \u2013 This move develops the knight to a strong central square and supports the pawn on g6.\n2. **g5f6** \u2013 This move also develops the knight and supports the pawn on f6.\n3. **g5h4** \u2013 This move develops the knight to a central square and supports the pawn on h4.\n4. **g5f4** \u2013 This move develops the knight to a central square and supports the pawn on f4.\n5. **g5e3** \u2013 This move develops the knight to a central square and supports the pawn on e3.\n6. **g5d2** \u2013 This move develops the knight to a central square and supports the pawn on d2.\n7. **g5c1** \u2013 This move develops the knight to a central square and supports the pawn on c1.\n8. **f1f6** \u2013 This move develops the queen to a strong central square.\n9. **f1f5** \u2013 This move develops the queen to a central square.\n10. **f1f4** \u2013 This move develops the queen to a central square.\n11. **f1f3** \u2013 This move develops the queen to a central square.\n12. **f1f2** \u2013 This move develops the queen to a central square.\n13. **f1e1** \u2013 This move develops the queen to a central square.\n14. **d1h5** \u2013 This move develops the bishop to a strong central square.\n15. **d1g4** \u2013 This move develops the bishop to a strong central square.\n16. **d1d4** \u2013 This move develops the bishop to a strong central square.\n17. **d1f3** \u2013 This move develops the bishop to a strong central square.\n18. **d1d3** \u2013 This move develops the bishop to a strong central square.\n19. **d1e2** \u2013 This move develops the bishop to a strong central square.\n20. **d1d2** \u2013 This move develops the bishop to a strong central square.\n21. **d1e1** \u2013 This move develops the bishop to a strong central square.\n22. **d1c1** \u2013 This move develops the bishop to a strong central square.\n23. **b1c3** \u2013 This move develops the knight to a central square.\n24. **b1a3** \u2013 This move develops the knight to a central square.\n25. **b1d2** \u2013 This move develops the knight to a central square.\n26. **h2h3** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on h3.\n27. **g2g3** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on g3.\n28. **c2c3** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on c3.\n29. **b2b3** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on b3.\n30. **a2a3** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on a3.\n31. **h2h4** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on h4.\n32. **g2g4** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on g4.\n33. **c2c4** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on c4.\n34. **b2b4** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on b4.\n35. **a2a4** \u2013 This move supports the pawn on a4.\n\n### Best Move:\nAmong all these, the move **g5h6** is the most promising. It develops the knight to a strong central square, supports the pawn on g6, and prepares for further development. It also threatens to control the center and create pressure on Black's position.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ng5h6\n```"
