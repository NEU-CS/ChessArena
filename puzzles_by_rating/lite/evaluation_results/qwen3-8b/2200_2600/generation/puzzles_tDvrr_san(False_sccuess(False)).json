When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The FEN notation is:\n\n```\n2r3k1/p4p1p/1q2p1p1/1pb2b2/2p2P2/6NP/PP3PP1/2RQRBK1 w - - 2 23\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **White to move**.\n- The position is complex with a mix of material and strategic possibilities.\n- White has a **queen**, **two rooks**, **two bishops**, and **two knights**.\n- Black has a **queen**, **two rooks**, **two bishops**, and **two knights**.\n- The position is **balanced** in material, but White has a slight **initiative** due to the open lines and the central control.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- White's pieces are somewhat centralized, and the king is somewhat exposed.\n- Black's king is in the corner, which is a weakness.\n- White has several options for development and central control.\n- The move `g3h5` is a **long diagonal move** that could threaten the black king or support a central pawn break.\n- The move `g3h5` also opens up the diagonal for the queen and bishop, potentially creating a strong attack.\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Moves:\n- **g3h5**: This move is **aggressive** and threatens the black king. It also opens up the diagonal for the queen and bishop, potentially leading to a strong attack.\n- **g3f5**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **g3e4**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **g3e2**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **g3h1**: This move is **unusual** and doesn't seem to contribute much to the game.\n- **g1h2**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **g1h1**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **f1c4**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **f1d3**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **f1e2**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **e1e6**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **e1e5**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **e1e4**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **e1e3**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **e1e2**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1d8**: This move is **unusual** and doesn't seem to contribute much to the game.\n- **d1d7**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1d6**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1h5**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1d5**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1g4**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1d4**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1a4**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1f3**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1d3**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1b3**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1e2**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1d2**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **d1c2**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **c1c4**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **c1c3**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **c1c2**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **c1b1**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **c1a1**: This move is **defensive** and supports the pawn, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **h3h4**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **b2b3**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **a2a3**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **b2b4**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n- **a2a4**: This move is **centralizing** and supports the center, but it doesn't directly threaten the black king.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe move **g3h5** is the **most aggressive** and **threatening** move, as it attacks the black king and opens up the diagonal for the queen and bishop. It also supports the center and creates a strong attacking position.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\n<move>\ng3h5\n</move>\n```"
