When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

It can support various attacks, especially on the **d-file** and **e-file**.\n- The **d5** square is occupied by White's queen, which is a strong piece but may be vulnerable to a pin or a fork.\n- Black's **d5** pawn is a key piece that can support attacks on the **e-file** or **c-file**.\n- The **e7** square is a critical square for Black's knight or bishop, as it can control the center and threaten the **d5** queen.\n- Black has several options for moving the queen or the knight to central squares.\n\n### Best Move:\nGiven the position, the best move is to **move the queen to e6**, which is a central square and supports the knight on **e7**. This move also threatens the **d5** queen and prepares for further attacks.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nc8e6\n```"
