When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The FEN notation is:\n\n```\n4rrk1/p2b1pp1/3p3p/3P4/1qN1N3/1P1Q3P/P4PP1/R5K1 b - - 0 23\n```\n\n### Position Summary:\n- **Black to move**.\n- The position is complex, with a mix of active pieces and potential for tactical play.\n- Black's king is on e8, and the rook on g8 is a key piece.\n- White has a strong center and some active pieces, but Black has a strong rook and queen in the center.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves include several options for the rook on g8 (e.g., g8h8, g8h7, g8e8), the queen on d7 (e.g., d7c8, d7e6, d7f5), and the pawn on b4 (e.g., b4b8, b4b7, b4b6, etc.).\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- Black's rook on g8 is a strong piece and can be used to control the center and support an attack.\n- The queen on d7 is also a key piece and can be used to support an attack or defend.\n- The pawn on b4 is a potential target for promotion, but it's not immediately threatening.\n\n### Best Move:\nAfter careful analysis, the best move is to **move the rook from g8 to h8**, which is a strong move that controls the h-file and supports the queen on d7.\n\n```\ng8h8\n```"
