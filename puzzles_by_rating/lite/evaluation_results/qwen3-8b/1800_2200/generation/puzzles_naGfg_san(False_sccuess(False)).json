When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The FEN notation is:\n\n```\n3r3k/3r4/Q2Pbq1p/2B1p1pP/1p2B3/6P1/P7/3R2K1 b - - 4 35\n```\n\nThis means it's **Black's turn to move**, and the position is complex with a mix of material and strategic possibilities.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Black's king is on **g8**, and the queen is on **d8**.\n- The rook on **h8** is a strong piece, and it has several options for moving forward.\n- The pawn on **d7** is a key piece, and it can support the queen or rook.\n- The white queen is on **d4**, and the white king is on **g1**.\n- Black has several strong candidates for moving the queen or rook, especially the rook on **h8**.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves include:\n- **h8g8**, **h8g7**, **d8g8**, **d8f8**, **d8e8**, **d8c8**, **d8b8**, **d8a8**, **d7h7**, **d7g7**, **d7f7**, **d7e7**, **d7c7**, **d7b7**, **d7a7**, **d7d6**, **f6f8**, **f6g7**, **f6f7**, **f6e7**, **f6g6**, **f6f5**, **f6f4**, **f6f3**, **f6f2**, **f6f1**, **e6g8**, **e6f7**, **e6f5**, **e6d5**, **e6g4**, **e6c4**, **e6h3**, **e6b3**, **e6a2**, **g5g4**, **b4b3**\n\n### Best Move:\nAmong the legal moves, the most promising and strategic move is **h8g7**. This move:\n- Develops the rook to a strong central square.\n- Supports the queen and prepares for further development.\n- Threatens to control the center and potentially launch an attack on the white king.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nh8g7\n```"
