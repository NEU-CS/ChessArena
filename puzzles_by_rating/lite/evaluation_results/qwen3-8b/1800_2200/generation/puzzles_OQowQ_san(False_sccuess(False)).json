When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The knight on `c3` is active, and the rook on `a1` is behind the pawn wall.\n- **Black's pieces:** Black has a strong rook on `a8`, a bishop on `c8`, and a queen on `d7`. Black's king is in the corner (`a8`), and the queen is well-placed to support the rook.\n- **White's king is on `e1`**, and the rook on `a1` is not yet developed.\n- **Black's pawn on `f7`** is a key target for White, as it is a weak pawn and can be captured with a strong move.\n\n### **Legal Moves Analysis:**\nAmong the legal moves, the most promising ones for White are those that target Black's weak pawn on `f7` or develop pieces effectively.\n\n#### **Candidate Moves:**\n1. **f7h8** \u2013 This is a **queen move** to `h8`, which is a strong square for the queen. It threatens check and could lead to a quick attack.\n2. **f7d8** \u2013 This is a **queen move** to `d8`, which is also a strong square for the queen.\n3. **f7h6** \u2013 This is a **knight move** to `h6`, which is a strong square for the knight.\n4. **f7d6** \u2013 This is a **knight move** to `d6`, which is also a good square for the knight.\n5. **f7g5** \u2013 This is a **knight move** to `g5`, which is a strong attacking square.\n6. **f7e5** \u2013 This is a **knight move** to `e5`, which is a central square and supports the pawn structure.\n\n### **Best Move:**\nAmong these, **f7g5** is the most promising move. It develops the knight to a strong attacking square, threatens to control the center, and prepares for a potential attack on Black's king.\n\n### **Final Move:**\n```\n<move>\nf7g5\n</move>\n```"
