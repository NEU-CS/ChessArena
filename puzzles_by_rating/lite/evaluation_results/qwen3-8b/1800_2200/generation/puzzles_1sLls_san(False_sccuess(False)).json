When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If it promotes, it could become a **queen** or **rook**, which would be a significant threat.\n- The **White queen on e3** is well-placed and can support multiple attacks.\n- The **White rook on g1** is also a strong piece and can be used to support the queen or attack the Black king.\n- The **White bishop on c1** is also a strong piece and can be used to support the queen or attack the Black king.\n- The **White king on g1** is safe and can be used to support the queen or rook.\n\n### Best Move:\nGiven the position and the available legal moves, the best move for White is to **move the queen to h6**, which attacks the Black pawn on g7 and supports the rook and bishop.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne3h6\n```"
