When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The rook on h8 is a key piece, and the knight on g6 is well-placed to support it. The queen on g5 is a significant threat, but Black has multiple ways to neutralize it or exploit it.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves include:\n- **Rook moves**: h8g8, h8f8, h8e8, d8g8, d8f8, d8e8, d8d7, d8d6, d8d5, d8d4\n- **Knight moves**: g6h6, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6c6, g6b6, g6a6, g6h5, g6g5, g6f5, g6g4, g6e4, g6g3, g6d3, g6g2, g6c2\n- **Other moves**: f4e6, f4h5, f4d5, f4h3, f4d3, f4g2, f4e2, b4c6, b4a6, b4d5, b4d3, b4c2, b4a2, h7h6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5\n\n### Best Move:\nThe most promising move for Black is to **develop the rook** and **support the knight** on g6. Among the rook moves, **d8d7** is a strong candidate. It:\n- Supports the knight on g6.\n- Threatens to open the d-file for further play.\n- Keeps the rook active and flexible.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nd8d7\n```"
