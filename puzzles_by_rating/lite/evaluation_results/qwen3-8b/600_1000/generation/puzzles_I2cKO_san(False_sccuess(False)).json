When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

It is vulnerable to being captured or restricted.\n- **Black's rook on h8** is also a strong piece, but it is not well-placed.\n- **Black's knight on g5** is a good piece, but it is not well-placed.\n- **Black's bishop on g7** is a good piece, but it is not well-placed.\n- **Black's pawn on f7** is a good pawn, but it is not well-placed.\n- **Black's king on g8** is not well-placed.\n- **White's queen on a1** is a strong piece, but it is not well-placed.\n- **White's rook on h1** is a strong piece, but it is not well-placed.\n- **White's bishop on c1** is a good piece, but it is not well-placed.\n- **White's knight on g2** is a good piece, but it is not well-placed.\n- **White's pawn on f2** is a good pawn, but it is not well-placed.\n- **White's king on g1** is not well-placed.\n\n### Best Move:\nAfter analyzing the position and the legal moves, the best move for Black is to move the **queen from e8 to e7**. This move:\n- Improves the queen's position.\n- Threatens to capture the white queen on a1.\n- Opens up the diagonal for the rook on h8.\n- Supports the knight on g5.\n- Creates a strong attacking position.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne8e7\n```"
