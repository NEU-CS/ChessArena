When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Promoting to a queen would be a strong move, especially if it leads to a quick checkmate or overwhelming advantage.\n- The **pawn on g5** is also a key piece. Moving it forward or sideways can support the queen or threaten the Black king.\n- The **queen on d4** is already in a strong position, and it can support the pawn on a7 or attack the Black queen on g7.\n- The **Black queen on g7** is vulnerable to attack, especially if the pawn on a7 promotes or the knight on c3 moves to support the queen.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe **pawn on a7** is the most promising piece to move. Promoting it to a queen on `a8` would be a powerful move, especially if it leads to a quick checkmate or overwhelming advantage.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\na7a8q\n```"

        "content": "The move `a7a8q` is invalid because the pawn on `a7` cannot promote to a queen on `a8` due to the presence of a piece (the rook on `a8`) blocking the square. Let's re-evaluate the position and choose the best legal move.\n\n### Re-evaluation of Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves include:\n- `a7a8` (pawn promotion to queen) \u2013 **invalid** due to the rook on `a8`\n- `a7b7`, `a7a6`, `a7a5`, `a7a4`, `a7a3` (pawn moves)\n- `g5h6`, `g5g6`, `g5h5`, `g5f5`, `g5e5`, `g5d5`, `g5c5`, `g5b5`, `g5a5`, `g5h4`, `g5g4`, `g5f4`, `g5g3`, `g5e3`, `g5d2`, `g5c1` (g5 pawn moves)\n- `c3d5`, `c3b5`, `c3e4`, `c3a4`, `c3e2`, `c3d1`, `c3b1` (c3 knight moves)\n- `h1g1`, `f1f5`, `f1f4`, `f1f3`, `f1f2`, `f1g1`, `f1e1`, `f1d1`, `f1c1`, `f1b1`, `f1a1` (f1 rook moves)\n- `b2b3`, `a2a3`, `b2b4`, `a2a4` (pawn moves)\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- The **pawn on a7** is still the most valuable piece to move. It can promote if advanced, but it cannot promote to `a8` due to the rook. The next best square is `a6`.\n- The **pawn on g5** is also a key piece. Moving it forward or sideways can support the queen or threaten the Black king.\n- The **queen on d4** is already in a strong position, and it can support the pawn on a7 or attack the Black queen on g7.\n- The **Black queen on g7** is vulnerable to attack, especially if the pawn on a7 promotes or the knight on c3 moves to support the queen.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe **pawn on a7** can move to `a6`, which is a safe and strategic square. This move keeps the pawn alive and prepares for future promotion.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\na7a6\n```"
