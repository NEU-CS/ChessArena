When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "To determine the best move, let's analyze the current position carefully. The FEN notation is:\n\n```\nr1r3k1/1p2qp1n/p5p1/2p1p2R/2BpP1P1/P2P2Q1/1PP2P2/2KR4 w - - 0 23\n```\n\nThis indicates that it is **White's turn to move**, and the position is complex with both sides having active pieces. Let's evaluate the key elements:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **White's pieces**: White has a strong central presence with pawns on c2, b2, and f2, and a rook on g4. The queen is on d1, and the bishop on c1 is active.\n- **Black's pieces**: Black has a strong pawn structure with pawns on a3, b2, c3, d4, e5, f4, g5, and h6. The queen is on g7, and the rook is on h8.\n- **Material balance**: Both sides have similar material, but White has more active pieces and better central control.\n- **King safety**: White's king is on g1, and Black's king is on g8. Both kings are somewhat exposed, but White's king has more support from pawns and pieces.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves provided include several options for White, such as:\n- **h5h7, h5h6, h5g5, h5f5, h5e5, h5h4, h5h3, h5h2, h5h1** (moves for the pawn on h5)\n- **c4f7, c4e6, c4a6, c4d5, c4b5, c4b3, c4a2** (moves for the knight on c4)\n- **g3e5, g3h4, g3f4, g3h3, g3f3, g3e3, g3h2, g3g2, g3g1** (moves for the knight on g3)\n- **d1d2, d1h1, d1g1, d1f1, d1e1** (moves for the queen on d1)\n- **c1d2, c1b1** (moves for the bishop on c1)\n- **g4g5** (move for the rook on g4)\n- **a3a4, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, f2f4, b2b4** (moves for pawns)\n\n### Best Move:\nAmong the legal moves, **g4g5** stands out as a strong candidate. This move develops the rook to a more active square, attacking the pawn on f5 and preparing to support the center. It also opens up lines for the queen and bishop, and it is a natural continuation of White's development.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\n<move>\ng4g5\n</move>\n```"
