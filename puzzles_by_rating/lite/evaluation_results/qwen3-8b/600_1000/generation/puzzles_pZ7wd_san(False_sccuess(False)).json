When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong rook on the 8th rank and a queen on the 8th rank as well. The king is somewhat exposed, and there are several tactical opportunities.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Black's pieces**: Rook on h8, queen on d8, knight on g6, and a few pawns.\n- **White's pieces**: Queen on d2, rook on h1, knight on f3, and pawns on the 7th and 6th ranks.\n- **Black's king** is on g8, somewhat exposed, and the white queen is on d2, which is a central square.\n- The position is balanced, but Black has more active pieces and a more central queen.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves for Black include several options, such as:\n- Moving the queen to d8 to e8, f8, or other squares.\n- Moving the rook from h8 to g8 or other squares.\n- Moving the knight from g6 to various squares.\n- Moving pawns to advance or support.\n\n### Best Move:\nAfter careful analysis, the best move for Black is to **move the queen from d8 to e8**, which is a natural and strong move that supports the rook and prepares for further development.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nd8e8\n```"
