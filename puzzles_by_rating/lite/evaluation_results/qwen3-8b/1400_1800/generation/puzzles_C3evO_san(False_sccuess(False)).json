When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The FEN notation is:\n\n```\n3r1rkb/p1N3np/1pb1p1p1/4Pp2/5PP1/P3BN1P/1PP4K/3R1R2 b - - 0 19\n```\n\nBlack is to move. The position is complex, with both sides having developed pieces and some tension in the center. Let's examine the key elements:\n\n- Black's king is on e8, and the rook on g8 is a strong piece.\n- The rook on d8 is also a strong piece, and it can support the king or attack the center.\n- White's king is on g1, and the queen is on d5, which is a central square.\n- The position is balanced, but Black has some potential for a strong attack, especially with the rook on d8 and the king on e8.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the legal moves:\n\n- **g8f7**: Moves the rook to f7, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **f8e8**: Moves the rook to e8, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **f8f7**: Moves the rook to f7, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **f8f6**: Moves the rook to f6, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8e8**: Moves the rook to e8, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8c8**: Moves the rook to c8, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8b8**: Moves the rook to b8, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8a8**: Moves the rook to a8, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8d7**: Moves the rook to d7, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8d6**: Moves the rook to d6, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8d5**: Moves the rook to d5, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8d4**: Moves the rook to d4, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8d3**: Moves the rook to d3, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8d2**: Moves the rook to d2, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **d8d1**: Moves the rook to d1, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **g7e8**: Moves the knight to e8, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **g7h5**: Moves the knight to h5, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **c6e8**: Moves the bishop to e8, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **c6a8**: Moves the bishop to a8, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **c6d7**: Moves the bishop to d7, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **c6b7**: Moves the bishop to b7, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **c6d5**: Moves the bishop to d5, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **c6b5**: Moves the bishop to b5, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **c6e4**: Moves the bishop to e4, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **c6a4**: Moves the bishop to a4, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **c6f3**: Moves the bishop to f3, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **f5g4**: Moves the knight to g4, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **h7h6**: Moves the pawn to h6, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **a7a6**: Moves the pawn to a6, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **g6g5**: Moves the pawn to g5, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **b6b5**: Moves the pawn to b5, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **h7h5**: Moves the pawn to h5, which is a central square and supports the king.\n- **a7a5**: Moves the pawn to a5, which is a central square and supports the king.\n\nAmong these, the move **d8d5** is particularly strong. It moves the rook to d5, which is a central square and supports the king. It also attacks the pawn on d4 and the knight on c6, which are both important pieces for White.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd8d5\n```"
