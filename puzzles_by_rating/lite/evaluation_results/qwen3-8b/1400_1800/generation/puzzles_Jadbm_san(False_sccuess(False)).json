When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The most promising options for White are:\n- **e1e8** (queen promotion)\n- **e1e7**, **e1e6**, **e1e5**, **e1e4**, **e1e3**, **e1e2** (queen moves)\n- **a1a2**, **a1d1**, **a1c1**, **a1b1** (rook moves)\n- **a7b8**, **a7b6** (pawn moves)\n- **g1h1** (rook move)\n- **h2h3**, **g2g3**, **f2f4**, **h2h4**, **f2f4** (pawn moves)\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- White is in a difficult position with limited options. The best move is likely to promote a pawn or move the queen to a more active square.\n- The pawn on b7 is the most advanced and can be promoted. The best square for promotion is **b8**, which is a central square and gives the most flexibility.\n- The move **b7c8** is a promotion to a queen, which is the most powerful piece and gives White the best chance to win.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nb7c8\n```"
