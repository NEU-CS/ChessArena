When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The FEN notation is:\n\n```\nr5r1/2p3qk/p2n1n1b/P2Pp2p/4Pp2/BN1N1Ppb/2Q1B1P1/R5RK w - - 0 26\n```\n\nThis means it's White's turn to move, and the position is complex with many pieces on the board. Let's break it down:\n\n- **White's pieces**: \n  - King on g1\n  - Queen on d1\n  - Bishop on c1\n  - Knight on b3\n  - Pawn on c2\n  - Pawn on d3\n  - Pawn on e2\n  - Pawn on a3\n  - Pawn on g2\n\n- **Black's pieces**:\n  - King on g8\n  - Queen on d8\n  - Bishop on c8\n  - Knight on b7\n  - Knight on d6\n  - Pawn on a7\n  - Pawn on b6\n  - Pawn on c5\n  - Pawn on d4\n  - Pawn on e6\n  - Pawn on f5\n  - Pawn on g7\n\nThe position is highly tactical, with many attacking and defending possibilities. White has a few key options, especially from the d3 square and the c2 square, which are central and strategic.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the legal moves:\n\n- **d3e5**: This move threatens to develop the knight to e5, which is a strong central square. It also supports the pawn on e2 and could lead to a strong central control.\n- **d3c5**: This move develops the knight to c5, which is a strong central square and could support the pawn on c2.\n- **d3f4**: This move develops the knight to f4, which is a strong attacking square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **d3b4**: This move develops the knight to b4, which is a strong attacking square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **d3f2**: This move moves the pawn to f2, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **d3b2**: This move moves the pawn to b2, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **d3e1**: This move moves the pawn to e1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **d3c1**: This move moves the pawn to c1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **b3c5**: This move develops the knight to c5, which is a strong central square and could support the pawn on c2.\n- **b3d4**: This move develops the knight to d4, which is a strong attacking square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **b3d2**: This move moves the knight to d2, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **b3c1**: This move moves the knight to c1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **a3d6**: This move develops the knight to d6, which is a strong attacking square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **a3c5**: This move develops the knight to c5, which is a strong central square and could support the pawn on c2.\n- **a3b4**: This move develops the knight to b4, which is a strong attacking square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **a3b2**: This move moves the knight to b2, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **a3c1**: This move moves the knight to c1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **e2f1**: This move moves the pawn to f1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **e2d1**: This move moves the pawn to d1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **c2c7**: This move moves the pawn to c7, which is a strong square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **c2c6**: This move moves the pawn to c6, which is a strong square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **c2c5**: This move moves the pawn to c5, which is a strong square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **c2c4**: This move moves the pawn to c4, which is a strong square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **c2c3**: This move moves the pawn to c3, which is a strong square and could threaten the black queen.\n- **c2d2**: This move moves the pawn to d2, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **c2b2**: This move moves the pawn to b2, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **c2a2**: This move moves the pawn to a2, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **c2d1**: This move moves the pawn to d1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **c2c1**: This move moves the pawn to c1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **c2b1**: This move moves the pawn to b1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **g1f1**: This move moves the knight to f1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **g1e1**: This move moves the knight to e1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **g1d1**: This move moves the knight to d1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **g1c1**: This move moves the knight to c1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **g1b1**: This move moves the knight to b1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **a1a2**: This move moves the pawn to a2, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **a1f1**: This move moves the pawn to f1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **a1e1**: This move moves the pawn to e1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **a1d1**: This move moves the pawn to d1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **a1c1**: This move moves the pawn to c1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **a1b1**: This move moves the pawn to b1, which is a weak square and not very useful.\n- **g2h3**: This move moves the pawn to h3, which is a strong square and could threaten the black queen.\n\nFrom this analysis, the best move is **d3e5**, as it develops the knight to e5, which is a strong central square and supports the pawn on e2. It also threatens the black queen and could lead to a strong central control.\n\n```\n<move>\nd3e5\n</move>\n```"
