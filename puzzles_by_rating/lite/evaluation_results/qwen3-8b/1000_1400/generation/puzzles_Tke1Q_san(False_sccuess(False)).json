When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Let's focus on the key elements:\n- **White's queen is on e3**, which is a central square with good mobility.\n- **White's rook is on h1**, and the knight on c3 is also active.\n- **Black's king is on g8**, and the queen is on c8, which is a strong position.\n- **Black's pieces are somewhat centralized**, but there are some weaknesses in the center and on the kingside.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves for White are:\n```\ng4c8, g4d7, g4g6, g4e6, g4h5, g4g5, g4f5, g4h4, g4f4, g4h3, g4g3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1, e3h6, e3b6, e3g5, e3c5, e3f4, e3d4, e3f2, e3d2, c3b5, c3a4, c3e2, c3d1, c3b1, g1h1, c1c2, c1f1, c1e1, c1d1, c1b1, c1a1, d5d6, c4c5, h2h3, g2g3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, b2b4, a2a4\n```\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\n- The move **g4c8** is a **queen move** to a central square, which is a strong move for White to control the center and prepare for a strong attack.\n- The move **e3h6** is a **queen move** to a more attacking square, but it may be less optimal than g4c8.\n- The move **g4c8** is a **queen move** that opens up the center and puts pressure on Black's king.\n- The move **g4d7** is also a **queen move**, but it's less central than g4c8.\n- The move **g4g6** is a **queen move** to a more attacking square, but it may not be as strong as g4c8.\n\n### Best Move:\nAfter careful analysis, the best move for White is:\n```\ng4c8\n```\n\nThis move is a **queen move** to a central square, which is a strong move for White to control the center and prepare for a strong attack.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\n<move>\ng4c8\n</move>\n```"
