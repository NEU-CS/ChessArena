When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

It can be promoted or moved to weaken Black's position.\n- The **queen on d2** is well-placed and can support attacks on the kingside.\n- The **knight on e4** is a strong piece and can be used to control key squares.\n- The **bishop on c1** is also a strong piece and can support the queen or knight.\n\n### Best Move:\nAfter evaluating all the legal moves, the best move is to **promote the pawn on a7 to a queen**. This move maximizes White's advantage and threatens a quick checkmate.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\na7a8q\n```"

It can be moved forward or promoted.\n- The move **a7a8q** is invalid because the pawn on a7 is not a queen, and the move format is incorrect.\n- The correct format for promoting a pawn to a queen is **a7a8q**, but this move is not valid in this position because the pawn on a7 is not a queen, and the move is not properly formatted.\n\n### Correct Move:\nInstead of promoting the pawn immediately, I will consider a more strategic and legal move. The best move in this position is to **move the knight from e4 to f6**, which is a strong and central square, and supports the queen and other pieces.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne4f6\n```"
