When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The FEN notation is:\n\n```\n4r2k/3q4/3p2QB/2p5/P1pP2P1/1P1N1R1P/6K1 w - - 3 32\n```\n\nThis indicates that it's White's turn to move, and the position is complex with a mix of active pieces and potential threats.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **White's King** is on `g1`, and the **Queen** is on `d1`.\n- **Black's King** is on `g8`, and the **Queen** is on `d4`.\n- The **White Rook** is on `h1`, and the **Knight** is on `b1`.\n- The **Black Rook** is on `h8`, and the **Black Bishop** is on `c8`.\n- The **White Bishop** is on `c4`, and the **White Knight** is on `d2`.\n- The **Black Pawn** on `e5` is a key piece, and the **White Pawn** on `d2` is also active.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves for White are:\n```\nh6f8, h6g7, h6g5, h6f4, h6e3, g6g8, g6e8, g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6f6, g6e6, g6d6, g6h5, g6g5, g6f5, g6g4, g6e4, d2e4, d2c4, d2f3, d2b3, d2f1, d2b1, g1g2, g1h1, g1f1, b2c3, g3g4, a3a4, h2h3, b2b3, h2h4, b2b4\n```\n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\n- The **White Queen** is on `d1`, and the **Black Queen** is on `d4`, so there is a direct line of attack on the `d`-file.\n- The **White Rook** on `h1` is not yet involved in the action, but it can be used to support an attack on the `h`-file.\n- The **White Bishop** on `c4` is active and can support attacks on the `d`-file or the `e`-file.\n- The **Black Queen** on `d4` is a key piece, and it is vulnerable to attack.\n- The **White Pawn** on `d2` is a good candidate for development and can support the Queen or Bishop.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe move `d2e4` is a strong candidate. It develops the **White Pawn** to `e4`, which:\n- Supports the **Queen** on `d1` and the **Bishop** on `c4`.\n- Opens up the `d`-file for the **Queen** to attack the **Black Queen** on `d4`.\n- Creates a strong central presence and threatens to control the center.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\n<move>\nd2e4\n</move>\n```"
