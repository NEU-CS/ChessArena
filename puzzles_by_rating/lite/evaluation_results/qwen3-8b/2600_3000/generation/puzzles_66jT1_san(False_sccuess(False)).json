When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The FEN notation is:\n\n```\n2Qn2k1/p3qppp/1p6/1b1B4/6P1/7P/P4r2/R1R4K w - - 1 29\n```\n\n### Position Summary:\n- **White to move**.\n- The position is complex with a lot of material on the board.\n- White has a queen, two rooks, and a bishop.\n- Black has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and a knight.\n- The position is likely in the middle game, with both sides having developed pieces and some pawn structure.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White's queen is on **c8**, which is a strong central square.\n- Black's queen is on **d5**, which is also a central square.\n- The white rooks are on **h1** and **c1**, and the black rooks are on **h8** and **d5**.\n- The white bishop is on **c4**, and the black bishop is on **b3**.\n- The white knight is on **g4**, and the black knight is on **g8**.\n- The white pawn structure is somewhat weak on the queenside, while the black pawn structure is also weak on the kingside.\n- The position is balanced, but White has the initiative due to the move order and the fact that it's White's turn.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves provided are:\n```\nc8d8, c8b8, c8a8, c8d7, c8c7, c8b7, c8e6, c8c6, c8a6, c8f5, c8c5, c8c4, c8c3, c8c2, d5a8, d5f7, d5b7, d5e6, d5c6, d5e4, d5c4, d5f3, d5b3, d5g2, h1g1, c1c7, c1c6, c1c5, c1c4, c1c3, c1c2, c1g1, c1f1, c1e1, c1d1, c1b1, a1b1, g4g5, h3h4, a2a3, a2a4\n```\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most promising moves for White:\n\n1. **c8d8**: Move the queen to d8.
