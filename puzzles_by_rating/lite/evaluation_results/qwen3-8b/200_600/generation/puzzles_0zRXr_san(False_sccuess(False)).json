When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a queen, rook, and pawns. The position is somewhat balanced, but White has more active pieces and a more central presence.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White's queen is on `c1`, which is a relatively safe square but not very active.\n- White's rook on `h1` is not yet developed.\n- White's king is on `e1`, and the position is not under immediate threat.\n- Black's queen is on `d4`, and their rook is on `h8`, which is a very strong square for a rook.\n- The pawns are somewhat locked in the center, and there are few open lines for immediate attacks.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves provided are numerous, but we can narrow them down based on strategic and tactical considerations.\n\n#### Candidate Moves:\n1. **c1c5** \u2013 Develops the queen to a more active square, controlling the center and preparing for future attacks.\n2. **c1c4** \u2013 Also develops the queen, but slightly less central than `c1c5`.\n3. **c1c3** \u2013 Develops the queen to a more central square, but may not be as effective as `c1c5`.\n4. **c1g1** \u2013 Moves the queen to the back rank, which is not ideal.\n5. **h2h3** \u2013 Develops the knight to a central square, but the knight is not on the board.\n6. **b2h8** \u2013 Moves the rook to the back rank, which is not ideal.\n7. **g3g6** \u2013 Moves the pawn to a central square, but it's not the best move for immediate development.\n8. **g3g5** \u2013 Moves the pawn to a central square, but it's not the best move for immediate development.\n9. **g3g4** \u2013 Moves the pawn to a central square, but it's not the best move for immediate development.\n10. **g3h3** \u2013 Moves the pawn to a central square, but it's not the best move for immediate development.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe most promising move for White is **c1c5**, which develops the queen to a more active square, controls the center, and prepares for future attacks.\n\n```\n<move>\nc1c5\n</move>\n```"
