When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The FEN notation is:\n\n```\nr1b2r2/pp1n2kp/2n2qp1/2ppp2B/3P4/2P1P3/PP1N1PP1/R2QK1NR w KQ - 2 13\n```\n\n### Position Summary:\n- **White to move**.\n- **White's pieces** are well-placed, with a strong central pawn structure and a developed queen and rook.\n- **Black's pieces** are somewhat cramped, with limited mobility for the queen and rook.\n- The position is **tense**, with White having a slight advantage due to better piece coordination and central control.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The **central pawns** (d4, e3, c3) are well-placed, and White has a **strong initiative**.\n- The **queen and rook on the kingside** are ready to attack.\n- Black's **queen is restricted** and has limited mobility.\n- The **pawn on h5** is a key piece, and moving it can create pressure on the kingside.\n\n### Legal Moves:\nThe legal moves include several options for the **h5 pawn** and the **d2 pawn**, as well as moves for the **kingside pieces**.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe **h5 pawn** is a strong candidate for movement. Moving it to **g4** (h5g4) is a natural and aggressive choice. It:\n- Supports the **central pawn structure**.\n- Creates pressure on the **kingside**.\n- Opens up lines for the **queen and rook**.\n- Limits Black's options for counterplay.\n\nThis move is **aggressive**, **centralizing**, and **strategically sound**.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nh5g4\n```"
