When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position:\n\n- Material: Black is down an exchange (White has two rooks, Black has one rook and a bishop), but Black has some activity.\n- White's threats: White's knight on d6 is strong, and White's rook on f2 is eyeing the f-file. White's king is relatively safe on g1.\n- Black's pieces: The rook on f8 is on an open file, the bishop on b5 is well-placed, and the rook on e5 is active. The king on h8 is somewhat exposed, but not under immediate threat.\n- Candidate moves:\n    - Rxe3: Captures a pawn, but after Nxf7+ or Nxb5, White gets material back and activates the knight.\n    - Re7: Defends the seventh rank, but is passive.\n    - f5: Gains space and attacks the g4 pawn, but weakens e6.\n    - h5: Gains space on the kingside.\n    - Bc6: Retreats the bishop, but is passive.\n    - Re6: Defends the knight on d6, but White can double rooks.\n    - f6: Defends e5, but weakens the kingside.\n    - Kg8: Moves the king to a safer square.\n    - Rg8: Prepares to double rooks on the g-file.\n\nThe most forcing move is:\n- Rxe3: If 27.Nxf7+ Kg7 28.Ng5 Re7, Black is still fighting. If 27.Nxb5 Bxb5 28.Nxb5, White wins a pawn.\n\nBut let's check if there's a better defensive or counter-attacking move.\n\n- f5: If 27.gxf5, then Bc6, and the bishop is more active. If 27.Nxb5 Bxb5 28.Nxb5, White wins a pawn.\n\n- Re7: Passive, but covers the seventh rank.\n\n- h5: Gains space, but doesn't solve the main issues.\n\n- Rg8: Prepares to double on the g-file, but doesn't address the threat to the e5 rook.\n\n- Re4: Attacks the g4 pawn, but White can defend with Rf3.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to play:\n```\nRxe3\n```\nThis grabs a pawn and forces White to decide between Nxf7+ or Nxb5, but in both cases, Black remains active and keeps fighting."
