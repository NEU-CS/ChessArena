Black must recapture with the king (Kxe8), after which White can continue the attack.\n2. **Qxh7+**: A check, but after Kd8 or Ke6, White loses momentum.\n3. **Qf7+**: Forces the king to d8 or d6, but doesn't win material immediately.\n4. **Bxf6+**: Bishop takes f6 with check, but Black can recapture with the queen or king.\n\n**Qxe8+** is the most forcing move, winning the queen and keeping the initiative. After Kxe8, White can continue with Bxf6 or other attacking moves.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxe8+\n```"
