When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

The queen on d2 is well-placed, and the rook on c1 can swing to the kingside if needed.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Qxd5+ (Check, forces Black's king to move or block, but after Qxd5 Qxd5 Nxe6, White wins the exchange)\n2. Ne4 (Centralizes the knight, attacks the queen and g5, but Black can play dxe4)\n3. Rc4 (Attacks the queen, but Black can play Qxh2+)\n4. h3 (Kicks the knight, but Black can play Qh2+)\n5. e4 (Opens the center, but Black's queen is active)\n6. Qxb4 (Wins a pawn, but Black's queen is very active)\n\nLet's calculate Qxd5+:\n- Qxd5+ Qxd5 Nxe6 (attacks the rook and the queen, but Black's queen is gone)\n- After Nxe6, White is up the exchange and a pawn, with a winning position.\n\nLet's check if there are any tactics for Black after Qxd5+ Qxd5 Nxe6:\n- Black can play Rf2, but White can simply take the rook.\n- Black has no immediate threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxd5+\n```"
