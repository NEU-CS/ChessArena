White's king is far from the action, but the rook is active.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. c1c6: Attacks the c6 pawn, threatening to win it.\n2. d4d5: Pushes the passed pawn, but Black can play cxd5.\n3. f3f4: Supports the center, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n4. h2h3: Gives luft, but not urgent.\n5. g2g3: Same as above.\n6. c1c5: Attacks h5, but Black can defend with Rb6 or Rb2.\n7. c1c4: Attacks h4, but not as effective as c6.\n\nThe most direct and active move is c1c6, attacking the c6 pawn and threatening to win it. If Black plays Rxd4, White can play h3, and the rook is active. If Black defends with Rb6, White can consider d5.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc1c6\n```"
