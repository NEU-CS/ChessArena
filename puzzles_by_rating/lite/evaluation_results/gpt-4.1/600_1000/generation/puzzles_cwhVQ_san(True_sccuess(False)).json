But after Qxc6, Black may play Rxe1+ anyway, and after Rxe1, Qd2, but White's queen is not on c2 anymore. Let's check the line:\n   - Qxc6 Rxe1# is not possible, but Qxc6 Rxe1+ Rxe1 Qd2 is not possible because the queen is not on c2.\n   - Qxc6 Qb5 (defending a8), but then Nc3, White is up a pawn.\n\n2. **Bishop moves**: Bxg5 is not possible, as the bishop is on c1.\n3. **Development**: Nc3 develops a piece, but doesn't address the bishop on d3.\n4. **Exchange on d3**: Qxd3 Qxg2# is mate, so that's not possible.\n5. **Rxe8+**: Rxe8 Rxe8, no immediate follow-up.\n6. **h4**: Kicks the queen, but doesn't address the bishop on d3.\n\n**Best move:**\n- Qxc6 wins a pawn, attacks the rook on a8, and Black has no immediate threats. The bishop on d3 is still annoying, but White can follow up with Nc3 to develop and defend.\n\n**Double-checking for tactics:**\n- After Qxc6, is there any immediate threat? No. Black can't play Qxg2# because the king is on g1.\n- After Qxc6, if Black plays Rxe1+, White plays Rxe1, and there is no mate.\n- After Qxc6, if Black plays Qb5, White can play Nc3, defending everything.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to grab the pawn with Qxc6.\n\n```\nQxc6\n```"
