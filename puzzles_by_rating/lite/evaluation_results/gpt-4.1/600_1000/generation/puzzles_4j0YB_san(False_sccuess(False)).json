When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...Nxd5, cxd5 attacks the bishop on d7 and opens the c-file. If ...Qb8, White can continue to press.\n- **c3b5** (Nc3-b5): Threatens to jump to d6, attacks c7, but less direct than Nd5.\n\n**Calculation for c3d5:**\n- 12. Nc3-d5! exd5 (if ...Nxd5, cxd5 wins a piece after ...exd5, as the bishop on d7 is pinned to the queen)\n- 13. cxd5 cxd5 (if ...Nxd5, Qxd5 wins a piece)\n- White has a strong center and open c-file.\n\n**Calculation for c3b5:**\n- 12. Nc3-b5 Qb8 (defends b7)\n- 13. Nc3-d6+ Bxd6 cxd6 Qxd6\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**Nc3-d5** is the strongest move, attacking both the queen and bishop, and if Black exchanges, White gets a powerful center and open lines.\n\nMy move:\n```\nc3d5\n```"
