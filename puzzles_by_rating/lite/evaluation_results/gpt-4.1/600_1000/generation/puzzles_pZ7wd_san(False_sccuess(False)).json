When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxe4 (threatening Qe8+ and possibly Ba6)\n- Black's king is still in the center, and White's pieces are very active.\n\n**Calculation for Qxg2:**\n- Not legal.\n\n**Calculation for Qg4:**\n- Not legal.\n\n**Calculation for Qe8:**\n- Not legal.\n\n**Calculation for Qh6:**\n- Retreats the queen, but loses activity.\n\n**Calculation for Qg5:**\n- Not legal.\n\n**Calculation for Qf7:**\n- Retreats the queen, but again, loses activity.\n\n**Calculation for Bd6:**\n- 1...Bd6 2. exf5 Qh5 (attacking h2, but White can defend easily)\n\n**Calculation for c6:**\n- 1...c6 2. Nxb6+ axb6 3. exf5 (White wins a pawn and Black's queenside is weak)\n\n**Calculation for d6:**\n- 1...d6 2. exf5 Qg5 (attacking g2, but White can play Qc4 or f4)\n\n**Calculation for Qg4:**\n- Not
