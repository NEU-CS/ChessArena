When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...cxd5, then Qxg6+ wins a pawn and attacks the king.\n- **e1e6** is a strong rook lift, attacking the bishop and threatening to double on the e-file.\n- **f2f3** attacks the knight on h3, but Black can play ...Nf4, attacking the queen and bishop.\n- **g3e4** centralizes the knight and attacks d6 and f6, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **b3d5** stands out because it attacks the queen and threatens to open the position against Black's king. If Black responds with ...cxd5, then Qxg6+ is very strong, as the king is exposed.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb3d5\n```"
