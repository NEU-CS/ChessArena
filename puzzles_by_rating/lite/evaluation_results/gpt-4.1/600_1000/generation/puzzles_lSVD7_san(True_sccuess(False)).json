When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After Qxf7+ Rxf7, Rxf7 Kxf7, White has traded queens and a rook, but loses some attacking potential.\n2. **Re8**: Piling up on the back rank, threatening mate on f8.\n3. **Qb7**: Threatens mate on g7, but Black can defend with ...Qc2+ or ...Qd1+.\n4. **g5**: Threatens to open the g-file and attack the king.\n5. **h5**: Similar idea, but less direct.\n6. **Qa8**: Threatens mate on f8, but Black can defend with ...Qc2+.\n\nLet's look at the most forcing move: **Qxf7+**\n\n- Qxf7+ Rxf7 (forced)\n- Rxf7 Kxf7\n\nNow White has traded queens and a rook, but loses attacking potential. Let's see if there's something better.\n\n**Re8** is a strong candidate:\n\n- Re8 Rfxe8 (forced, otherwise mate on f8)\n- Rxe8+ Rxe8\n- Qb7 (threatening mate on g7)\n\nBut after ...Qd1+ or ...Qc2+, Black can check and try to draw by perpetual.\n\n**Qb7** threatens mate on g7, but Black can check with ...Qc2+.\n\n**g5** is interesting, trying to open the g-file.\n\nBut let's check **Re8** more deeply:\n\n- Re8 Rfxe8\n- Rxe8+ Rxe8\n- Qb7 (threatening mate)\n- Qd1+ (only check)\n- Ka2 (only move)\n- Qxg4 (defending g7, but White can play Qxa7+ and pick up pawns)\n\nAlternatively, after **Re8**, if Black tries ...Qd1+ immediately:\n\n- Re8 Qd1+ (trying to distract)\n- Qxd1 Rfxe8\n- Rxe8+ Rxe8\n\nWhite is up a rook for a queen, but Black has some counterplay.\n\nBut **Qxf7+** is the most forcing. Let's see:\n\n- Qxf7+ Rxf7\n- Rxf7 Kxf7\n\nNow, White can play g5, threatening g6+ and h5, and the king is exposed.\n\nAlternatively, **Re8** is more direct and keeps the queens on.\n\nAfter careful analysis, **Re8** is the most powerful, as it threatens mate and forces Black to give up material or get mated.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nRe8\n```"
