When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's knight is on d3, attacking e5 and f2. Black's pawns are advanced and dangerous, especially the d3 pawn. White's rook is on h1, not very active, but can swing to the 6th rank for checks.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rh6+ (forces Black's king to h7 or f7, but after Kg7, rook is a bit awkward)\n- e5 (pushes, but dxe5 is not possible, but Nxe5 is possible)\n- f3 (defends e4, but allows d2)\n- Kg4 (activates king, but g4 is not safe)\n- Rook moves along the h-file (not threatening much)\n- a4, b3, b4, a3 (pawn moves, not urgent)\n- f4 (opens up, but could weaken king)\n\nLet's check Rh6+:\n1. Rh6+ Kg7 (if Kf7, then Rh7+ Kg6, rook is not doing much)\n2. Rd6 (attacking d3 pawn, but Nxb2, Black grabs a pawn)\n\nWhat about f3?\n1. f3 (defends e4, but d2 threatens to promote, after Rd1, Nxb2, Black is still pressing)\n\nWhat about e5?\n1. e5 Nxe5 (knight is centralized, not ideal)\n\nWhat about Kg4?\n1. Kg4 Nxf2+ (forks king and rook, bad)\n\nWhat about Rh8?\n1. Rh8 (threatens to swing rook, but doesn't change much)\n\nWhat about a4 or b3?\nNot urgent, doesn't address the threats.\n\nWhat about Rh5?\n1. Rh5 (attacks g5, but after Nxb2, Black is still up a pawn)\n\nWhat about f4?\n1. f4 (if gxf4+, Kxf4, but then Nxf2, Black wins f2 pawn)\n\nWhat about Rh6+?\n1. Rh6+ Kg7\n2. Rd6 (attacks d3, but Nxb2)\n\nWhat about Rh2?\n1. Rh2 (defends f2, but d2, and after Rh1, Nxb2)\n\nWhat about Rd1?\n1. Rd1 (immediately attacks d3, but Nxb2)\n\nIt seems the best practical chance is to activate the rook with a check and try to get behind Black's pawns. Rh6+ is the most forcing move, and after Kg7, White can try to get the rook behind the pawns or attack the d3 pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRh6+\n```"
