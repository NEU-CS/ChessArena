If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

After Qxh6 gxh6, Black's king is somewhat exposed, but White's attacking potential is greatly reduced, and Black can play for the endgame with a solid structure.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQh6\n```"
