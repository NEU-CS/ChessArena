Qd2 (or Qf2) Bxf3 17. Rxf3\n- Black has traded a bishop for a knight, but White's rook is active.\n\nWhat about **Qh4**?\n- 15...Qh4 16. Nxh4 (illegal, knight is pinned) 16. Qxg7# (not possible, g7 is protected)\n- 16. h3 Bxh3 17. Qxg7# (not possible, g7 is protected)\n- 16. Qxg7# (not possible)\n\nWhat about **Bxh2+**?\n- 15...Bxh2+ 16. Nxh2 Be2 17. Rfe1 Qg5 18. Qf2 Bh5\n- Not enough compensation.\n\nWhat about **Qf6**?\n- 15...Qf6 16. Qxg4 Qg6 17. Qxg6 hxg6\n- Queen trade, but White is better.\n\nWhat about **Re4**?\n- 15...Re4 16. Qd2 (or Qf2) Bxf3 17. Rxf3\n\nWhat about **c5**?\n- 15...c5 16. Qxg7#\n\nWhat about **Qd7**?\n- 15...Qd7 16. Qxg7#\n\nWhat about **Qh4**?\n- 15...Qh4 16. Qxg7#\n\nWhat about **Bxf3**?\n- 15...Bxf3 16. Qxg7#\n\nWait, after 15...Bxf3 16. Qxg7# is checkmate! So, Bxf3 loses to Qxg7#.\n\nWhat about **Re4**?\n- 15...Re4 16. Qxg7#\n\nSo, any move that doesn't defend g7 loses immediately.\n\nTherefore, the only moves to consider are those that defend g7.\n\n**Defensive moves:**\n- **f6**: Blocks the bishop, but weakens the king.\n- **Bf8**: Retreats the bishop to defend g7.\n- **Qf8**: Retreats the queen to defend g7.\n\nBetween these, **Bf8** is the most natural, defending g7 and keeping the queen active.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nBf8\n```"
