When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:** f6f8, f6d8, e2e8\n\n**Material:**\n- Black: King on h8, Queen on f6, Bishop on d4, Rook on e2, pawns on b7, g7, h7, a6\n- White: Queen on d8, Rook on f5, Rook on f1, King on h3, pawns on a4, b2, h2\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- White is threatening mate with Qf8# or Rf8#.\n- Black's king is in a precarious position.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n1. **f6f8**: Queen to f8, blocks mate, but White can exchange queens and then play Rxf8+, and after Rxf8, Rxf8# is mate.\n2. **f6d8**: Queen to d8, blocks mate, but White can play Rf8# (since the queen is pinned by the rook on f1).\n3. **e2e8**: Rook to e8, blocks mate, but White can play Qxe8, and after Qxe8, Rxe8, Rf8# is mate.\n\nLet's check each move:\n\n- **f6f8**: 1... Qf8 2. Rxf8# (since the queen is pinned by the rook on f1, so White's rook can capture on f8 and it's mate).\n- **f6d8**: 1... Qd8 2. Rf8# (same as above, the queen is pinned and cannot capture).\n- **e2e8**: 1... Re8 2. Qxe8+ Qf8 3. Rxf8#\n\n**Is there any way to avoid mate?**\n\n- All legal moves only delay mate by one move. There is no way to avoid mate in the next move.\n\n**Best move:**\nSince all moves lose immediately, but perhaps f6f8 at least blocks the mate for one move.\n\n```\nf6f8\n```"
