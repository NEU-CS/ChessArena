If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Legal moves:** Kf2, Kh1\n\nLet's reconstruct the board for clarity:\n\n- White King: g1\n- White Rooks: b1, e1\n- White Queen: c4\n- White Knights: b5, b8\n- White pawns: a3, b2, d5, g3, h2\n- Black King: g8\n- Black Rook: a8\n- Black Bishop: g7\n- Black Queen: h3\n- Black pawns: d6, e7, f6, g6\n\nBlack's last move must have been ...Qh3, threatening mate on g2.\n\n**Threats:**\n- Black threatens Qg2#, which is checkmate.\n- The only legal moves are Kf2 and Kh1.\n\nLet's check both:\n\n1. **Kf2**\n   - After Kf2, Black can play Qg2+ (since the King is on f2, g2 is not mate, but it's check).\n   - After Kf2 Qg2+, White must play Ke3 (the only legal move).\n   - Then Black can play Nxe1 (if there is a knight on f3, but in the FEN, it's a knight on f3, so Nxe1 is possible).\n   - This sequence leads to White being in a very precarious position.\n\n2. **Kh1**\n   - After Kh1, Black can play Qg2#, which is checkmate.\n\nSo, **Kf2** is the only move that avoids immediate mate.\n\nTherefore, the best (and only) move is:\n```\nKf2\n```"
