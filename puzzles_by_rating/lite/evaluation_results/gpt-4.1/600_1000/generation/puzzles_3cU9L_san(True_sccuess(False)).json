When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After Ke2, can play Nxd6.\n   - **Rg1+**: Forces Kxg1, then Nxd6.\n4. **Nd2+**: Check, but after Ke2, not much follow-up.\n5. **Ng3+**: Forces Kf2, but then White's king is closer to the pawns.\n6. **g5**: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat.\n\n**Critical lines:**\n- **Rf4+**: If 1...Rf4+ 2.Ke2 (or Kg2), then 2...Nxd6, and Black wins the d6 pawn. If 3.Nxd6+ Nxd6, Black is up material and the e6 pawn is blockaded.\n- **Nxd6**: If 1...Nxd6 2.Nxd6+ Ke7 3.Nb7, White is threatening to queen, but Black can try to stop the pawn.\n- **Rg1+**: If 1...Rg1+ 2.Kxg1 Nxd6, again Black wins the d6 pawn.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Rf4+** is the most forcing, as it checks the king and then allows Nxd6 next, removing White's most dangerous pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRf4+\n```"
