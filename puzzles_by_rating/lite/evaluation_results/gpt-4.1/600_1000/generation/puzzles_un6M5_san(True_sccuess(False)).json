If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If the rook leaves the g-file, g1=Q is possible.\n- If the knight on g4 moves, g1=Q is unstoppable.\n- Rf4 attacks the knight and threatens to win material or force the knight to move, after which g1=Q.\n\n**Check for counterplay:**\n- White's only hope is to create threats with the knight or rook, but with the king on f2 and the knight on g4, there are no immediate tactics.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Rf4** attacks the knight on g4, and if the knight moves, g1=Q is unstoppable. If White plays Rxg2, then fxg2, and the pawn will promote. If White plays Nxe5, then Kxe5, and Black is still winning.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nRf4+\n```"
