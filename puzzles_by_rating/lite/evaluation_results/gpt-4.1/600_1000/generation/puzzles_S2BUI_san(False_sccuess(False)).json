When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qb8+ (forces the king to g8, as the rook on c7 is pinned)\n2. Qxc7 (captures a rook, but after dxc3, Black gets a dangerous passed pawn)\n3. Qxg6 (captures a pawn, but allows Rce7 and the queen is less active)\n4. Qb7 (retreat, but not threatening)\n5. Qxg7+ (sacrifice, but after Kxg7, White has no follow-up)\n\nLet's check Qb8+:\n- Qb8+ Kg8 (only move)\n- Qxc7 Rxc7 (if Black recaptures, White is up a bishop and pawns, but Black has two rooks)\n- After Qb8+ Kg8, White can play Qxc7, but then Rxc7, and Black has some counterplay.\n\nAlternatively, Qxc7 immediately:\n- Qxc7 Rxc7, White is up a bishop and pawns, but Black's rooks are active.\n\nWhat about Qb8+ Kg8, then Qxc7 Rxc7, and then cxd4? White is up a piece and pawns.\n\nBut let's check for tactics. Is there a forced mate?\n- Qb8+ Kg8, Qxc7 Rxc7, cxd4 cxd4, and White is up a piece and two pawns.\n\nIs there a better move? What about Qxg6?\n- Qxg6, Black can play dxc3, but White can play bxc3, and Black's threats are minimal.\n\nWhat about Qb8+? It seems the most forcing.\n\nFinal decision: Qb8+ is the most forcing move, keeping the initiative and pressing Black's king.\n\n```\nb6b8\n```"
