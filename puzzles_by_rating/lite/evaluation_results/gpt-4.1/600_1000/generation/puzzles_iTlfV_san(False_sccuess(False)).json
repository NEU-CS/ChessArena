When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The h-file is open, and White's rook is on h5, threatening h7.\n- White's king is safe on c1.\n\n**Tactics:**\n- The move h5h7 is a direct threat, as it attacks the knight and threatens mate on h8 if the knight moves.\n- The bishop on c4 eyes f7, and the queen on g3 is well-placed for kingside attack.\n- The rook on d1 can swing to h1 if needed.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. h5h7: Threatens mate on h8 if the knight moves, and attacks the knight.\n2. c4f7: Bishop takes on f7, attacking the queen and threatening discovered checks.\n3. g3e5: Queen centralizes, attacking the queen and threatening to invade.\n4. g4g5: Pawn push, but doesn't seem urgent.\n5. f2f4: Opens the f-file, but not as forcing.\n\n**Analysis of h5h7:**\n- If ...Ng5, then Qh4 or Qh2 threaten mate.\n- If ...Qf6, then g5 wins the knight.\n- If ...Kh8, then Rxh7+ Kg8 Qh4 is crushing.\n- If ...Nf8, then Qh4 is very strong.\n\n**Analysis of c4f7:**\n- ...Qxf7, then Rxh7 Qxh7 Qxe5, but Black's king escapes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move h5h7 is the most forcing, threatening Rxh7 followed by Qh4/Qh2 and mate. Black is under severe pressure and has no good defense.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nh5h7\n```"
