When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is relatively safe.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- b6b8: Rook to 8th rank, but doesn't threaten much immediately.\n- b6b7: Rook to 7th, attacks g7 pawn, threatens to invade.\n- b6e6: Rook takes pawn with check. This is a forcing move.\n- b6d6: Rook attacks bishop, but bishop can move.\n- f3f4: Pawn push, attacks the bishop, but bishop can move.\n- a3a4: Pawn push, creates a passed pawn.\n- h2h4: Pawn push, creates kingside space.\n\nThe most forcing move is b6e6, capturing the e6 pawn with check. Let's analyze this:\n\n1. b6e6+ (Rook takes pawn, check)\n   - Black must respond. If ...fxe6, then White can play g2g4+ and try to win the bishop.\n   - If ...Kxe6, then White can play Ke3, centralizing the king and threatening to win more pawns.\n\nOther moves are less forcing and do not create immediate threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb6e6\n```"
