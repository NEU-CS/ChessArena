When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**Position (Black to move):**\n- Black king on c6, queen on d8, rook on h8, rook on a8, knight on c5, knight on e7, pawns on a7, b7, c7, h7, g6, h8.\n- White king on e1, rook on a1, rook on h1, bishop on e6, knight on b1, pawns on a2, b2, c2, d5, e4, g2, h2.\n\n**Material:**\n- Both sides have all major pieces, but White has a bishop on e6, deep in Black's territory, and a pawn on d5.\n- Black's king is on c6, somewhat exposed.\n- White's king is on e1, still in the center, possibly uncastled.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n- c6d6 (King to d6)\n- c6b6 (King to b6)\n- c6b5 (King to b5)\n- d8d5 (Queen to d5)\n- e7d5 (Knight captures pawn on d5)\n\n**Candidate move analysis:**\n\n1. **c6d6 (King to d6):** \n   - Moves the king closer to the center, but doesn't solve the problem of the bishop on e6 or the pawn on d5. The king remains exposed.\n\n2. **c6b6 (King to b6):**\n   - King moves to the queenside, but again, doesn't address the threats.\n\n3. **c6b5 (King to b5):**\n   - King moves further to the queenside, possibly more exposed.\n\n4. **d8d5 (Queen to d5):**\n   - Queen moves to d5, attacking the bishop on e6 and the pawn on e4. However, White can play exd5, and after Nxe6, Black loses the queen for insufficient compensation.\n\n5. **e7d5 (Knight captures pawn on d5):**\n   - Knight captures the pawn on d5, attacking the bishop on e6 and defending the queen. If White exchanges on d5 (exd5+), Black can recapture with the king or queen, but the king remains exposed.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n\n- After **e7d5**, if White plays exd5+, Black can recapture with the king (c6xd5), and the king is still exposed but not immediately in danger. The bishop on e6 is attacked and may have to retreat, giving Black some breathing room.\n- **e7d5** also develops a piece and contests the center.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is **e7d5**. It removes a dangerous pawn, attacks the bishop, and keeps the queen on the board to help defend.\n\nFinal move:\n```\ne7d5\n```"
