If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

After that, Black can try to coordinate an attack with the bishop and rook.\n2. **Rxc3**: Captures a pawn, but then White can play Ra8+ and start checking the Black king.\n3. **Be5**: Centralizes the bishop, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n4. **c5**: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n5. **Kh8**: Passive, doesn't improve the position.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Rh4+**: White must play gxh4 (only move), then Bxf6, but then White's king is still stuck.\n- **Rxc3**: White can play Ra8+ Kf7, Ra7+ and start checking.\n- **Be5**: No immediate threat.\n\n**Let's look at Rh4+:**\n1. ... Rh4+\n   - 2. gxh4 Bxf6 (now White's king is still stuck, and Black has a passed h-pawn)\n   - Black can then play h5-h4, and the White king is in a mating net.\n\n**This looks very promising for Black.**\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRh4+\n```"
