Let's see what happens: 1...Rf5+ 2.Ke6 (or Ke7) and White's king stays active. The rook on f5 is not protected, so after 2.Ke6, White could try to attack the rook.\n- b6 or b5: advancing the pawn could help create a passed pawn, but White's king is close enough to stop it.\n- Ra4: attacks the rook on c4, but after Rxa4, bxa4, White's king is still active.\n- Ra3, Ra2, Ra1: not very useful.\n- Rc5: attacks the rook, but White can just exchange.\n- Rh5 or Rg5: not much impact.\n\n**Best plan:**\n- Black's best chance is to activate the rook and try to create counterplay with the b-pawn. The move b5 is interesting, aiming to create a passed pawn. If White takes, a5-a4 can follow.\n\nBut let's check if Rf5+ is dangerous for Black:\n1...Rf5+ 2.Ke6 (or Ke7) and the rook is attacked, so not ideal.\n\n**What about b5?**\n- 1...b5 2.Rc7 (attacking a6) 2...Kg6 (activating the king) 3.Ra7 (taking a6) 3...Ra4 and Black can try to activate the rook.\n\n**What about b6?**\n- 1...b6 2.Rc7 (attacking a6) 2...Kg6 3.Ra7 and White wins the a6 pawn.\n\n**What about Ra4?**\n- 1...Ra4 2.Rxa4 bxa4 and Black has a passed pawn, but White's king is very active.\n\n**What about Kh8?**\n- Just a waiting move, but White can improve.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The best chance for Black is to play b5, trying to create a passed pawn and activate the rook.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb5\n```"
