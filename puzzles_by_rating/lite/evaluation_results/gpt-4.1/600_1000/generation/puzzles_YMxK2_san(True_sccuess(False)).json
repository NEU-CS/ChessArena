If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

The bishop on f1 is still undeveloped, but White's queen and knight are centralized.\n- Black's knight on f6 is attacked by the queen and bishop, but not currently under threat.\n- Black's light-squared bishop on b4 pins the knight on c3 to the king.\n- Black's king is still in the center, but castling is possible.\n- White's king is still in the center as well.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **O-O**: Castling kingside, bringing the rook to f8 and safeguarding the king.\n2. **d6**: Supporting the center and opening the diagonal for the c8 bishop.\n3. **Bxc3+**: Capturing on c3 with check, forcing bxc3, which would double White's pawns but open the b-file for White's rook.\n4. **Nh5**: Attacking the bishop on g3, but White can respond with Be2 or Bh4.\n5. **Nxe4**: Grabbing the e4 pawn, but after Nxe4 Nxe4 Qxe4, Black loses a piece.\n\nLet's check the safety of castling:\n- After O-O, White doesn't have any immediate threats. The king is safer, and the rook is activated.\n\nLet's check Bxc3+:\n- Bxc3+ bxc3, now the c3 pawn is weak, but White's queen is on d3 and can swing to g3 or h4.\n\nLet's check d6:\n- d6 supports the center, but White can play Qc4, attacking the bishop and threatening to castle queenside.\n\n**O-O** is the most prudent move, as it completes development, secures the king, and prepares to contest the center.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nO-O\n```"
