When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxg7+ (if the rook moves, but currently not possible)\n2. Qc7 to f7 (Qc7f7) threatens mate on g7 and attacks the rook on f2.\n3. Qc7g3 (Qc7g3) attacks g7 and h6, but not forcing.\n4. Qc7e7 (Qc7e7) attacks the rook on f8 and threatens Qxf8+.\n5. Qc7d8+ (Qc7d8) check, but Black can block with Rf8.\n6. Bf7 (Bishop moves to f7) is not legal, but Bc4f7 is legal and attacks the rook on f2 and threatens mate on g7.\n\n**Tactical Considerations:**\n- Qc7f7 threatens Qxg7# (mate) and attacks the rook on f2.\n- Black cannot defend g7 easily: if Rxf7, then Qxf7 and Qxg7# is coming.\n- If Qxf7, then Rxf7 and White is up material.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- Qc7f7 is a strong move, threatening mate and attacking the rook.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nc7f7\n```"
