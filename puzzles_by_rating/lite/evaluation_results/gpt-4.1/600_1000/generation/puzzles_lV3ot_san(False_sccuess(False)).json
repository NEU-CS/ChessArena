When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has two rooks, 6 pawns.\n- White's rook on c6 is active and pressuring the 6th rank.\n- Black's rook on a2 is active on the second rank.\n- Black's king is on g8, White's king is on e3.\n- Black's pawns: d7, e6, f7, g6, h7.\n- White's pawns: c4, f4, g2, h2, f6, h3.\n\nImmediate threats:\n- White's f6 pawn is dangerous and could promote if not stopped.\n- Black's rook on a2 is active but not immediately threatening.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g8h8 or g8f8: King moves, but not urgent.\n2. c6 moves: The rook could move to attack or defend.\n3. a2 moves: The rook could swing to another file or rank.\n4. h7h6 or h7h5: Pawn moves, but do not address the f6 pawn.\n5. d7d6 or d7d5: Pawn moves, but White's rook is attacking d7.\n6. g6g5: Pawn push, but White can respond with f5+.\n7. e6e5: Pawn push, but White can take with fxe5.\n\nThe most urgent issue is the f6 pawn. If White plays Rc8+ and f7, Black will be in trouble. Therefore, the best move is to play ...d7d6, blocking the rook's access to the 8th rank and preparing to bring the other rook into play.\n\nHowever, after d7d6, White can play Rc8+ and after Rxc8, f7+ Kf8, fxe8=Q+ Kxe8, Black is down material.\n\nAlternatively, consider ...Ra8, challenging the rook on c6. But then White can play Rc7, attacking the d7 pawn.\n\nWhat about ...Ra3+? After Kd4, Black doesn't gain much.\n\nWhat about ...Ra8? After Rc7, d7 is attacked twice.\n\nWhat about ...d7d5? If White plays cxd5, exd5, the pawn structure is opened, but Black's king is still far.\n\nWhat about ...e6e5? If fxe5, dxe5, the f6 pawn is gone, but White can play c5, and the rook on c6 is still active.\n\nWhat about ...g6g5? If f5, exf5, exf5, gxf5, White's rook is still active.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best defensive move is to play ...d7d5, opening up the center and trying to activate the rook and king.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd7d5\n```"
