When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If ...Rxf5, then Bxf5+ Kg7 (forced), then White can continue with Rxf5, but Black's king escapes.\n- Bf7+ is a check. If ...Kf6, then Ne4+ wins the rook on c5.\n- Rxf5 is a capture, but not a check.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **Bf7+**: Forces the king to f6 or h6. If Kf6, then Ne4+ is a fork.\n2. **Bxf5+**: Immediate check, but after ...Rxf5, White loses the bishop.\n3. **Rxf5**: Captures a pawn, but no immediate threat.\n4. **Nd5**: Attacks the rook on c7, but not forcing.\n5. **h4**: Quiet move, not urgent.\n\nLet's calculate **Bf7+**:\n\n1. Bf7+ Kf6 (forced)\n2. Ne4+ (forks king and rook)\n   - If ...Ke7, then Nxc5 wins the rook.\n   - If ...Kg7, then Nxc5, White wins the exchange.\n\nSo, **Bf7+** is a forcing move that wins material.\n\n**Double-check for any tactics after Bf7+ Kf6 Ne4+:**\n- Black's king is on f6, White's knight on e4, bishop on f7, rook on f2.\n- Black's rook on c5, d8.\n- After Ne4+, Black must move the king, and White wins the rook on c5.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is:\n```\nBf7+\n```"
