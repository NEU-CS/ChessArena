When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Rook moves: c4c5, c4h4, c4g4, c4f4, c4e4, c4d4, c4b4, c4a4, c4c3\n2. King moves: g8h8, g8f8\n3. Bishop moves: f6d8, f6e7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4, f6d4, f6c3\n4. Pawn moves: h7h6, g7g6, c6c5, h7h5, g7g5\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- White's bishop on f6 is very strong, controlling many squares.\n- Black's rook is active, but White's rook is also dangerous.\n- Moving the king to h8 or f8 doesn't improve the position.\n- Moving the rook to c5 attacks the bishop, but White can defend.\n- Moving the rook to c3 attacks the pawn on c3, but White can defend with Ra8+ and then Kg7.\n- Pawn moves like h7h6 or g7g6 are possible, but may weaken the kingside.\n\n**Best move analysis:**\n- Rook to c5 (c4c5) attacks the bishop, but after Bd4, White keeps everything defended.\n- Rook to c3 (c4c3) attacks the pawn, but after Bxc3, White wins a pawn.\n- Rook to h4 (c4h4) threatens mate on h1, but White can defend with Kg2.\n- Rook to e4 (c4e4) attacks the bishop and keeps pressure.\n- Pawn to c5 (c6c5) is possible, but doesn't change much.\n\n**Tactical ideas:**\n- Rook to h4 (c4h4) is interesting, threatening mate on h1. White must respond with Kg2, after which Black can play Rh2+ and force the king back to g1, but then White's king is still safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most aggressive move is:\n```\nc4h4\n```\nThis threatens mate on h1 and forces White to respond, giving Black the initiative."
