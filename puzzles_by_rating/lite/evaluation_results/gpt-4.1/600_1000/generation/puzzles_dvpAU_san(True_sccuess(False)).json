If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After gxh3, Black can try Qxd2, but White's queen and rook are very active.\n2. **Qxb7**: Grabs a pawn, but White's attack continues.\n3. **g5**: Kicks the queen, but f5 may come.\n4. **Bd4**: Centralizes the bishop, attacks the queen, and covers f6.\n5. **Nf6**: Blocks the queen's access to g6 and e5, but White can play Qxg6+ anyway after the knight moves.\n\n**Deep Calculation:**\n- **Rxh3+ gxh3 Qxd2**: White can play Qxe6+ or Qd7, but after Qxe6+ Kf8, White has no immediate mate. However, White is up material.\n- **Bd4**: Attacks the queen, forces it to move, and covers f6. If Qg5, then Bf6. If Qf3, then Nf6.\n- **g5**: Qxg5, and White is threatening f5.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Bd4** is a strong move, attacking the queen and forcing it to move. It also covers f6, which is a key defensive square, and keeps the position solid. It also prepares to double rooks or bring the knight into play.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nBd4\n```"
