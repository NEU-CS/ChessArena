If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Qxg8: Captures a knight, threatens Qxg7+ and possibly Qf7# if the king moves.\n2. Qf8+: Forces the king to f6 or e6 (since the bishop on d4 covers f6 and e5), but after ...Kf6, White can continue the attack.\n3. Qe8+: Forces the king to f6 or e6.\n4. Qd8+: Forces the king to e6 or f7.\n5. Qxa7: Grabs a pawn, but less forcing.\n6. Bb7: Develops a piece, but not as forcing as the queen moves.\n\nLet's check Qf8+:\n- Qf8+ Ke6 (if Kf6, then Qxg8 wins the knight with check, and the king is still exposed)\n- After Qf8+ Ke6, White can play Qxg8, but Black's king is still in the center and vulnerable.\n\nLet's check Qxg8:\n- Qxg8, White wins a piece, threatens Qxg7+, and keeps the initiative.\n\nLet's check Qd8+:\n- Qd8+ Ke6 (if Kf6, then Qxg8)\n- After Qd8+ Ke6, White can play Qxg8, similar to above.\n\nLet's check Qxa7:\n- Qxa7 is just a pawn grab, not as strong as Qxg8.\n\nAre there any direct mates?\n- No immediate mate, but Qxg8 is the most forcing and wins material.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxg8\n```"
