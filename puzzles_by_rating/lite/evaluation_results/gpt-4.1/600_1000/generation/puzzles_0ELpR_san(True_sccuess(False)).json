When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If ...Qxc7, then Rxd8+ Qxd8 Rxe5 wins a piece.\n2. **Rxe5**: Captures bishop, but after Nxe5, White's queen is attacked.\n3. **Qxb7**: Not possible.\n4. **b4**: Attacks the queen, but doesn't seem to lead to anything concrete.\n5. **Qf1**: Defends f2, but passive.\n6. **Nd4**: Attacks bishop and queen, but Black can play ...Bxd4.\n\n**Calculation for Nc7:**\n- 1. Nc7 Qxc7 (forced, otherwise lose exchange)\n- 2. Rxd8+ Qxd8\n- 3. Rxe5 Nxe5\n- 4. Qe2 (attacks e5 knight and threatens Qxe5)\n- White is up a piece.\n\n**Calculation for Rxe5:**\n- 1. Rxe5 Qxe5\n- 2. Rxd8+ Kh7 (if Qf8, then Rxf8)\n- 3. Rxd8 Qh2# (no, not possible)\n- Not as strong as Nc7.\n\n**Calculation for b4:**\n- 1. b4 Qxb5\n- 2. bxa5 (not clear)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**Nc7** is a strong tactical move, forking rook and bishop, and after the forced sequence, White wins material.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nNc7\n```"
