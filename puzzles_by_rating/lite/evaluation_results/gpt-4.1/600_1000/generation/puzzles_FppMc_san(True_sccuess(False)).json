Black must respond. If Kxh7, then Nf5+ is a fork, forking the king and rook on d6.\n2. **Nf5+**: Not possible, as g4 pawn blocks f5.\n3. **Re8**: Quiet, but not as strong as Rxh7+.\n4. **Bxg6**: Not possible, as the bishop is on b1.\n\n**Let's calculate Rxh7+:**\n- 1. Rxh7+ K moves (only move is Kg5, as Kxh7 loses to Nf5+ fork)\n- 1... Kg5\n- Now, White can play Nf3+ (forking king and rook), or h4+ (driving the king further), or Ne6 (attacking the rook on d8).\n\nBut let's check: after 1. Rxh7+ Kg5, 2. Nf3+ Kf4, 3. Rf7 (threatening mate on f5), but Black can defend.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Rxh7+ Kxh7, 2. Nf5+ Kg6, 3. Nxd6, White wins the exchange.\n\nBut after 1. Rxh7+ Kxh7, 2. Nf5, Black can play Rd2+ and get counterplay.\n\nBut let's check if Rxh7+ is safe:\n- 1. Rxh7+ Kxh7\n- 2. Nf5 Rd2+ (only check)\n- 3. Kg3 (or Kf3) and White is safe.\n\nSo, Rxh7+ wins a pawn and gets a strong attack.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is the forcing check, grabbing a pawn and opening up the Black king.\n\n```\nRxh7+\n```"
