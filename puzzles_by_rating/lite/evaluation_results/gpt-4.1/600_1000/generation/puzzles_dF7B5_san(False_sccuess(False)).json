When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White is threatening Rc6# (mate in one), so Black must address this immediately.\n\n**Immediate threats:**  \n- Rc6# is mate.  \n- Black must parry the mate threat.\n\n**Legal moves that defend against Rc6#:**\n- g6g7 (block the 7th rank)\n- g8g7 (same idea)\n- b6a6 (move king, but Rc6# is still mate)\n- g6g5 (doesn't stop mate)\n- g8h8, g8f8, etc. (doesn't stop mate)\n\n**Only moves that stop mate:**  \n- g6g7  \n- g8g7\n\nLet's check both:\n\n1. **g6g7:**  \n   - White can play R2c6# (mate, since the rook on g7 doesn't cover c6).\n   - So, g6g7 loses to Rc6#.\n\n2. **g8g7:**  \n   - Now, if Rc6+, Black can play Kb7 or Kb5.\n   - Let's check: Rc6+ Kb7, White can play Rxg7+, but then Black is still in the game.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe only move that avoids immediate mate is:\n```\ng8g7\n```"
