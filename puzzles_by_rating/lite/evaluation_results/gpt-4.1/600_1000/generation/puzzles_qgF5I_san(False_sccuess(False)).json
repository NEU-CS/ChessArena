When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...Nxe2, then Nxe7+ wins the bishop with check.\n2. **e2e6**: Queen to e6 attacks the bishop on e7 and threatens Qxe7, but Black can play Nxe6.\n3. **e2e4**: Queen to e4 attacks the knight on d4 and centralizes the queen.\n4. **d1d4**: Rook to d4 attacks the knight on d4 and prepares to double rooks.\n5. **f2f3**: Kicks the knight, but weakens the king.\n\n**Deep calculation for c3d5:**\n- 1. Nc3d5 Nxe2 (attacks the queen)\n- 2. Nxe7+ Kh8 (forced)\n- 3. Qxe2 (White is up a piece)\n\n**Check for tactics:**\n- After 1. Nc3d5, if Black doesn't take on e2, White threatens Nxe7+ winning the bishop.\n- If 1...exd5, White can recapture with the queen or rook, gaining a strong center.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**Nc3d5** is a strong tactical move, attacking the bishop and threatening Nxe7+. If Black takes on e2, White wins a piece. If not, White's knight is dominant.\n\nMy move:\n```\nc3d5\n```"
