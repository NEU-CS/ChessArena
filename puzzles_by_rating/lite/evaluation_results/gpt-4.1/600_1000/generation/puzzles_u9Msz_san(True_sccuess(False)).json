If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Rxb3+ \u2014 This grabs a pawn with check and attacks the White king. After Kxb3, Black can continue with a rook invasion or push pawns.\n2. Rxg2 \u2014 This grabs a pawn, but White can respond with Rxg2, trading rooks, which may not be optimal for Black, who is pressing.\n3. g5 \u2014 This supports the f4 push and keeps the kingside pawns rolling.\n4. f4 \u2014 Immediate pawn break, but White can respond with Nc6+ or Nc2, and the position opens up.\n5. h4 \u2014 Pushes the h-pawn, but not urgent.\n6. Rg5 \u2014 Defends the f5 pawn and prepares to double on the g-file.\n7. b5 \u2014 Pushes the b-pawn, but White can play axb5.\n\nOf these, Rxb3+ looks the most forcing and gains a pawn with check, keeping the initiative.\n\nLet's check the line:\n1... Rxb3+ 2. Kxb3 (forced)\nNow Black can play f4, g5, or continue with rook activity. But first, let's see if White has any dangerous counterplay after Rxb3+.\n\n- After 1...Rxb3+ 2.Kxb3, White's king is more exposed, and Black's rook can swing to the c-file or a-file.\n- Black is up a pawn and has a very active position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxb3+\n```"
