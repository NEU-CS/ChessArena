If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Qh5: Defends h7, but the queen is still exposed.\n2. Qf5: Defends h7 and attacks the knight on b1.\n3. Qd5: Centralizes the queen, but may be vulnerable.\n4. f5: Kicks the queen, but weakens the king.\n5. g6: Gives luft, but weakens dark squares.\n6. Qxb5: Captures the knight, but after Bxb5, White's pieces are even more active.\n7. Qd4: Attacks the bishop on d3 and threatens to exchange queens.\n8. Qe5: Offers a queen trade, but White can decline.\n9. Rd8: Defends d7, but does not address the threat to the queen.\n10. a6: Kicks the knight, but after Nc7, White attacks the rook and bishop.\n\nLet's look at Qxb5:\n- Qxb5 Bxb5 wins a piece for White, so not good.\n\nQd4:\n- Qd4 Nxd4 wins the queen, so not good.\n\nQh5:\n- Qh5 is safe, defends h7, and keeps the queen active.\n\nQf5:\n- Qf5 attacks the knight on b1, but White can play Qxf5 exf5 Bxf5 and White is better.\n\na6:\n- a6 Nc7 attacks the rook and bishop, not good.\n\nQe5:\n- Qe5 Nxe5 Nxe5 Nxe5 Bxh7+ Kh8 Qxe5 and White is better.\n\ng6:\n- g6 is possible, but weakens the dark squares.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the best move is:\n- Qh5, defending h7 and keeping the queen active.\n\nTherefore, my move is:\n```\nQh5\n```"
