When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:** g7h8, g7h6\n\n- Black's king is on g7, and the only legal moves are to h8 or h6.\n- White's threats: White has a very strong attack. The bishop on h6 and the rook on f4 are eyeing the kingside. The knight on f6 is also a huge threat, controlling key squares and threatening mate ideas.\n- Black's king is in grave danger. The only legal moves are king moves, so Black must move the king.\n\n**Analysis of the two moves:**\n\n1. **g7h8 (Kg7-h8):**\n   - This puts the king in the corner. White can continue the attack, possibly with Rh4, threatening mate on h7, or Ng5, or even Bf8.\n   - After g7h8, White has several mating ideas, but Black is not immediately mated.\n\n2. **g7h6 (Kg7-h6):**\n   - This puts the king on h6, where it is exposed to checks from the rook or bishop.\n   - White can play Rh4+, and after Kg6, White can play Bh5#, which is checkmate.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- If 21...Kh6, then 22. Rh4+ Kg6 23. Bh5# is mate.\n- If 21...Kh8, White does not have an immediate mate, but the attack continues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- 21...Kh6 is immediately losing to mate in two.\n- 21...Kh8 is forced, as it avoids immediate mate.\n\n**Best move:**\n```\ng7h8\n```"
