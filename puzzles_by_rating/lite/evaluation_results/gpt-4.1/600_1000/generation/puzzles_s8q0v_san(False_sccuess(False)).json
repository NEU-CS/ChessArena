When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...Nxb3, then Nxe5, but Black is up a piece.\n- b3f7: Bishop takes f7+, if ...Rxf7, then Nxf7, Qxf7, Qg5 (but Black is up material).\n- d2f4: Queen to f4, attacking d4 and f7, but Black can play Ne2+.\n\nLet's check g5e4:\n- g5e4 attacks the queen and knight. If ...Nxb3, then Nxf6+ Qxf6, Qxf6 gxf6, cxb3, White is down a piece.\n\nWhat about d2e3:\n- d2e3 defends d4, but Black can play Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5, Qxg5, fxg5, Rxb3, White is down a pawn.\n\nWhat about b3d5:\n- b3d5 attacks the rook and knight. If ...Bxd5, Qxd5, Ne2+, Kf1, Nf4, Qf3, Qxg5, Qg4, Qxg4, hxg4, Nxd5, White is down a pawn.\n\nWhat about d2a5:\n- d2a5 attacks b7 and a6, but Black can play Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about g1h2:\n- g1h2, just a king move, not active.\n\nWhat about f2f3:\n- f2f3, defending e4, but Black can play Ne2+, Kf2, Qg3+, Kf1, Nf4, Qf2, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about c2c3:\n- c2c3, attacking the knight, but Black can play Ne2+, Kf1, Nf4, Qxf4, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about d2f4:\n- d2f4, attacks d4 and f7, but Ne2+, Kf1, Nxf4, Qxf4, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about g2g3:\n- g2g3, giving king luft, but Black can play Ne2+, Kf1, Nxf4, Qxf4, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about h3h4:\n- h3h4, slow.\n\nWhat about b3e6:\n- b3e6, attacks rook, but Nxe6, Nxe6, Qxe6, Re1, Qg6, Nf4.\n\nWhat about b3d5:\n- b3d5, attacks rook and knight, if ...Bxd5, Qxd5, Ne2+, Kf1, Nf4, Qf3, Qxg5, Qg4, Qxg4, hxg4, Nxd5, White is down a pawn.\n\nWhat about d2e1:\n- d2e1, defending e4, but slow.\n\nWhat about d2e3:\n- d2e3, defending d4, but Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about d2c3:\n- d2c3, defending b3, but Ne2+, Kf1, Nxc3, Qxc3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about d2e2:\n- d2e2, defending e4, but Ne2+, Kf1, Nf4, Qf3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about d2d1:\n- d2d1, defending d4, but slow.\n\nWhat about d2c1:\n- d2c1, defending b3, but slow.\n\nWhat about b1e1:\n- b1e1, defending e4, but slow.\n\nWhat about b1f1:\n- b1f1, defending f2, but slow.\n\nWhat about b1d1:\n- b1d1, defending d4, but slow.\n\nWhat about b1c1:\n- b1c1, defending c2, but slow.\n\nWhat about b1a1:\n- b1a1, defending a3, but slow.\n\nWhat about c2c4:\n- c2c4, attacking d5, but Black can play Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about f2f4:\n- f2f4, attacking e5, but Black can play Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about g2g4:\n- g2g4, attacking h5, but Black can play Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about f2f3:\n- f2f3, defending e4, but Black can play Ne2+, Kf1, Nf4, Qxf4, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about c2c3:\n- c2c3, attacking the knight, but Black can play Ne2+, Kf1, Nxf4, Qxf4, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about a3a4:\n- a3a4, attacking b5, but Black can play Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about b3a4:\n- b3a4, attacking b5, but Black can play Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about b3c4:\n- b3c4, attacking b5, but Black can play Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about b3a2:\n- b3a2, retreat, but not active.\n\nWhat about b3a4:\n- b3a4, attacking b5, but Black can play Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about g5f3:\n- g5f3, retreat, but not active.\n\nWhat about g5e6:\n- g5e6, attacking rook and queen, but Nxe6, Nxe6, Qxe6, Re1, Qg6, Nf4.\n\nWhat about g5e4:\n- g5e4, attacking queen and knight, but Nxb3, cxb3, Qxg5.\n\nWhat about g5h7:\n- g5h7, attacking rook, but Qxh7.\n\nAfter all this, the best move seems to be to play c2c3, attacking the knight on d4 and trying to drive it away, while also opening up the b-file for the rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc2c3\n```"
