If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If ...Nfd7, White can play Qh7+ or f4.\n- **Ne4**: If ...Nxe4, Nxe4, dxe4, White has a pawn on e4, but loses a piece.\n- **c4**: If ...bxc4, bxc4, Nxc4, White loses a pawn.\n- **f4**: Prepares to push f5, but Black can play Nbd7.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **Bg5** is the most promising, as it increases pressure on f6, prepares for possible tactics on h6, and keeps the initiative.\n\nTherefore, my move is:\n```\nBg5\n```"
