When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

After Kh2, Black can try Bd6, but White is still better.\n- **Qe2** threatens mate on g2 and attacks the rook on e1. If White plays Rxe2, fxe2, then Black threatens mate with Rd1+.\n\nLet's check **Qe2**:\n- 32... Qe2 33. Rxe2 fxe2 34. Kg2 e1=Q 35. Rxe1 Bxd6\nBut White can play 33. Nf5, defending g2.\n\nAlternatively, **Qb1+**:\n- 32... Qb1+ 33. Kh2 Bxd6 34. Qxd8+ Kg7 35. Qxd6 Qxe1\n\nBut after 34. Qxd8+, White is winning.\n\n**Defensive move:**\n- **Rxd6** is forced, otherwise Black loses a piece.\n\nBut after 32... Rxd6 33. Qxe7, White wins a piece.\n\n**Is there a way to create counterplay?**\n- **Qb1+** is the most forcing move, but doesn't lead to mate.\n\n**Final decision:**\nGiven the threats, the best practical chance is to play:\n```\nQb1+\n```\nThis gives a check and hopes for a mistake, as all other moves lose material immediately."
