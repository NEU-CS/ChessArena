Rxh7+ Nxh7 (forced)\n2. Qxg6+ Kh8 (forced, as ...Kf8 loses to Qxf7#)\n3. Rh1 (threatening mate on h7)\n\nBlack cannot stop Qxh7# without losing massive material or getting mated. For example:\n\n- ...Qg5+ (only way to delay mate)\n- Qxg5 Kg8\n- Qxg6+ Kf8\n- Rxh7\n\nWhite is winning.\n\n**Conclusion:** Rxh7+ is a crushing move, leading to a decisive attack.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRxh7+\n```"
