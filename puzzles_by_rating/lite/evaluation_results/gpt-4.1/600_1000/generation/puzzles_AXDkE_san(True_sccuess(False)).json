If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White's king is on c2, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's pieces: \n  - Rooks: a5 and d8, both active.\n  - Bishop: d8, controls long diagonal.\n  - Knight: d5, centralized.\n  - King: f6, somewhat exposed but not under immediate threat.\n  - Pawns: b7, g7, g4, a4, f6, e6.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **Nb4+**: This is a forcing check. If White plays Kc3, then Nxa2+ wins the rook on b1. If Kd2, then Rxd6 wins the knight.\n2. **Ra7**: Defends the 7th rank, but not very active.\n3. **Ra8**: Passive.\n4. **Rxd6**: Captures the knight, but then White can play Bxd5, attacking the rook and threatening mate ideas.\n5. **g3**: Not urgent.\n6. **Nb6**: Retreats, but not necessary.\n\n**Let's calculate Nb4+:**\n- 26...Nb4+ 27. Kc3 (if Kd2, then Rxd6 wins the knight)\n  - 27...Nxa2+ 28. Bxa2 (forced) Rxd6, Black wins a piece.\n- If 27. Kb2, then a3+ wins the bishop.\n\n**Conclusion:** Nb4+ is a strong, forcing move that wins material.\n\nMy move:\n```\nNb4+\n```"
