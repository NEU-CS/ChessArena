When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is more active, but White's king is not far behind.\n\nShort-term tactics:\n- Black's knight is well-placed but not attacking anything directly.\n- White's knight on f2 is not threatening immediate forks.\n- Black's king is centralized and could try to attack White's pawns, but must be careful not to allow White's pawns to roll.\n\nLong-term strategy:\n- Black needs to activate the king and knight to attack White's pawns or blockade them.\n- Black must avoid allowing White to create a passed pawn on the queenside.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f6g8: Retreats the knight, but seems passive.\n2. f6e8: Also retreats, but doesn't help.\n3. f6h7: Moves knight to the rim, not ideal.\n4. f6d7: Knight toward the queenside, could help blockade.\n5. f6h5: Attacks g3, but White can defend.\n6. f6d5: Centralizes knight, attacks c3 and e3 squares, but e4 pawn is defended.\n7. f6g4: Attacks e3, but White's king covers it.\n8. f6e4: Sacrifices knight for pawn, not good.\n9. g5h6: King to h6, but not active.\n10. b6b5: Tries to open queenside, but White can respond with a5.\n11. a6a5: Prepares b5, but White can play axb5.\n\nThe most promising move is to centralize the knight and try to blockade White's pawns. Moving the knight to d7 prepares to go to f6 or b8 to attack c4, or to e5 to pressure d3 and c4.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf6d7\n```"
