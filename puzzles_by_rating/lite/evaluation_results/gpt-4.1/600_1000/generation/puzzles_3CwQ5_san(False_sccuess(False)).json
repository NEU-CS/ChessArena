When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position:\n\n**Material:**\n- Both sides have all major pieces except each side is missing a light-squared bishop.\n- White: Queen on c2, rooks on a1 and f1, bishop on e3, knights on d2 and h2, pawns on a2, b3, c3, d4, f2, g2, h3.\n- Black: Queen on c7, rooks on c8 and f8, bishop on c8, knight on b6 and f6, pawns on a6, b5, d5, e6, f7, g7, h6.\n\n**King safety:**\n- Both kings are relatively safe, but White's king is a bit more open due to the pawn structure.\n\n**Piece activity:**\n- White's pieces are well centralized. The bishop on e3 is strong, knights are ready to jump.\n- Black's pieces are also active, but the knight on b6 is a bit awkward.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **c2h7** (Qxh7+): Not possible, as h7 is protected by the knight on f6.\n2. **e3h6** (Bxh6): Bishop takes h6, attacking the rook on f8 and threatening mate ideas.\n3. **d2e4** (Nxe4): Centralizes the knight, attacks d6, and opens the bishop's diagonal.\n4. **c3c4**: Undermines Black's center, but bxc4 is possible.\n5. **g2g3**: Prepares to fianchetto the bishop, but slow.\n6. **f2f4**: Aggressive, but weakens e4 and e3 squares.\n7. **h2g4**: Knight to g4, eyes f6 and h6.\n\n**Tactical ideas:**\n- Bxh6 is very tempting, as after gxh6, White can play Bxh6, but the bishop is already on e3, so it's just a capture.\n- If Bxh6, Black can recapture with the knight or pawn, but after Bxh6, the rook on f8 is under attack.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- 1. Bxh6 gxh6 2. Qg6+ Kh8 3. Qxf6+ Kg8 4. Ng4 (threatening Nxh6#) but Black can defend.\n- 1. Bxh6 Nbd7 (defending f6) 2. Bxg7 Kxg7 3. Qd3 (threatening Qg3+), but not decisive.\n\n**Alternative:**\n- Ndf3 brings the knight to a more active square, but not threatening.\n- c3c4 is logical, but bxc4 opens the b-file for Black's rook.\n\n**Best move:**\n- Bxh6 is the most aggressive and forces Black to respond. If Black plays gxh6, White's queen and knight can swing to the kingside for an attack. If Black plays Nbd7, White can consider Bxg7.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne3h6\n```"
