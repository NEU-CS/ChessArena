When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

However, Black's queen on c1 is very active and can give checks or threaten mate.\n- Black's pawn on e2 is one step from promotion.\n- Black's king is on g6, White's king on h2.\n- White's bishop on c4 is strong, controlling the f7 square and helping with promotion threats.\n- Black's pawn on a3 is also close to promotion.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e2e1=Q (promote to queen)\n2. e2e1=R (promote to rook)\n3. c1c4 (capture the bishop)\n4. h6h7 (move king pawn)\n5. g6g5 (advance king pawn)\n6. h5h4 (advance h-pawn)\n7. a3a2 (advance a-pawn)\n\nLet's check the most forcing moves:\n\n1. **e2e1=Q**: Promoting to a queen. White can reply Rd7, threatening f7-f8=Q. But after e2e1=Q, if White plays f7-f8=Q, Black can play Qg3+ and try to force perpetual or mate. But let's check if c1c4 is better.\n\n2. **c1c4**: Captures the bishop. White can play f7-f8=Q, and after c4c4, f7-f8=Q, Black can play Qf4+ or Qg1+.\n\nBut let's check the most direct move: **e2e1=Q**.\n\nAfter e2e1=Q, White can play f7-f8=Q, and then Black can play Qg3+ (threatening mate). If White blocks with Kg1, then Qe1+ wins the queen. If White plays Kg1, Qe1+ wins the queen on f8.\n\nSo, **e2e1=Q** is the best move, as it promotes and threatens to win White's new queen or checkmate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne2e1q\n```"
