When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Legal move:** gxh3\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, Bishop, 6 pawns\n- Black: Queen, 2 Bishops, 6 pawns\n\n**Position:**\n- White's queen is on h6, threatening mate on h8 if the f8 rook moves.\n- White's bishop is on d5, controlling key diagonals.\n- White's rook on f1 and e1, king on h1.\n- Black's king is on e8, with some pawn cover but exposed.\n- Black's queen is on d7, bishop on c5 and e5, rook on h3, pawns on a6, f6, g7, h7.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- The only legal move is gxh3, capturing the rook on h3 with the g2 pawn.\n- This opens the h-file, but White's king is on h1 and not immediately in danger.\n- After gxh3, White is up material (rook for pawn) and maintains a strong attack.\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n- White should continue to press the attack, possibly doubling rooks on the e-file or f-file, and look for mating nets or winning more material.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only legal move is:\n\n```\ngxh3\n```"
