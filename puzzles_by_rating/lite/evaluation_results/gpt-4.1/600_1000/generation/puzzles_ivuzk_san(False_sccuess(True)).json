When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:** g1f2, g1h1\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n- Black's last move was ...Qh3, threatening mate on h2.\n- White's king is on g1, and the only legal moves are to f2 or h1.\n- White's queen is on c4, rooks on b1 and e1, knight on b5 and b8, pawns on a3, b2, d5, g3, h2.\n- Black's queen is on h3, knight on f3, bishop on g7, pawns on d6, e7, f7, g6, h7, rook on a8.\n\n**Threats:**\n- Black threatens mate with ...Qxh2#.\n- White cannot block the h-file or interpose any piece.\n- Only king moves are available: g1f2 or g1h1.\n\n**Analysis of candidate moves:**\n\n1. **g1f2**\n   - King moves to f2.\n   - Black can play ...Qxh2+ (check), forcing the king back to f1 or e3.\n   - After ...Qxh2+, White's king is exposed, and Black's queen and knight are active.\n   - However, after ...Qxh2+, White can play Kxf3, but then ...Nd2+ is dangerous.\n   - This line is very risky for White.\n\n2. **g1h1**\n   - King moves to h1.\n   - Black can play ...Qxh2+ K moves to h1, but that's not possible since the king is already on h1.\n   - After ...Qxh2+, White must play K moves, but again, that's not possible.\n   - Actually, after Kh1, Black has no immediate mate, but can try ...Qxh2+ K moves to h1, but that's a repetition.\n   - So, after Kh1, Black can try ...Qxh2+ K moves to h1, and it's a draw by perpetual check.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Both moves are forced, but Kh1 avoids immediate loss and may allow White to hold a draw by repetition.\n- Kf2 leads to a quick loss.\n\n**Best move:**\n```\ng1h1\n```"
