If Black plays e4, White can play dxe4, and the king is close to support the d-pawn. The king is also closer to the queenside, supporting pawn promotion.\n\n2. **d5c6**: King moves to c6, aiming for queenside, but the d-pawn is left behind and Black might get counterplay on the kingside.\n\n3. **d5c5**: King steps back, less active.\n\n4. **d5c4**: King steps back, less active.\n\n5. **d3d4**: Pawn advances, but after exd4, Kxd4, Black's king is active and can try to support the g-pawn.\n\nThe most promising plan is to use the king's activity to support the d-pawn and try to create a passed pawn. Advancing the king to d6 keeps maximum pressure and flexibility.\n\n**Best move:**  \n```\nd5d6\n```"
