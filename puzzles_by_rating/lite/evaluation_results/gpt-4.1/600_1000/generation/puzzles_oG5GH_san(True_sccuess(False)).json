Re8+ Rxe8 19. d4, White gains space, but Black is fine.\n- **Be6**: 17...Be6 18. Bxe6 fxe6, Black's pawn structure is slightly compromised, but not critical.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **Qxd5** removes White's most active piece and doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White. Black remains solid and can develop the knight next.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nQxd5\n```"
