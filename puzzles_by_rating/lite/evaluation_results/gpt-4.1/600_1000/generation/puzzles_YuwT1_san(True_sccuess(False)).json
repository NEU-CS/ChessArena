If Kf3, then Ne5+ wins the queen. If Kg1, then Qxd1.\n2. **Qd2+**: Forces White's king to move, but after Qe2 White can block.\n3. **Qxc2+**: Captures a pawn with check, but White can block with Qe2.\n4. **Nxd5**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n5. **Re1**: Pins the knight, but White can play Qe2.\n\nLet's look at **Ng4+** in detail:\n- 27...Ng4+ 28. Kf3 (if Kg1, then Qxd1 wins the knight) Ne5+ 29. Kf2 Nxd3+ (winning the queen) 30. cxd3 Qxd1\n\nThis sequence wins White's queen and should be decisive.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nNg4+\n```"
