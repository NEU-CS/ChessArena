If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Be8: Retreats bishop, but doesn't threaten anything.\n2. Bc8: Retreats bishop, but not useful.\n3. Be6: Attacks rook on a6, forces it to move.\n4. Bc6: Attacks rook on a6, forces it to move.\n5. Bf5: Attacks f4 pawn, but can be met with gxf5.\n6. Bb5: Attacks rook, but not as forcing as Be6 or Bc6.\n7. Rd5: Attacks bishop on c5, and threatens to invade on d8 or d7.\n8. c4: Expands on queenside, but not urgent.\n9. g3: Prepares to defend f4 square, but not urgent.\n10. Kc2: Improves king, but not urgent.\n\nOf these, Be6 and Bc6 both attack the rook on a6, forcing it to move. Between the two, Be6 also attacks the f7 pawn, and keeps pressure on the kingside. After Be6, if ...Rxe6, Bxe6 is very strong, and if ...Rxe6 is not played, the rook must move, and White can continue to improve.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nBe6\n```"
