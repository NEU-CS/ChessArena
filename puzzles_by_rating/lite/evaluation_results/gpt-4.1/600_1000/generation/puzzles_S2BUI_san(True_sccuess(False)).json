If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Black's king is on h8 and looks exposed. White's queen is very active on b6, and the bishop on g2 eyes the a8-h1 diagonal.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Qb8+ (forcing, checks the king)\n2. Qxg6 (captures a pawn, but is it safe?)\n3. Qxc7 (captures a rook, but is it safe?)\n4. Kg3 (improves king safety)\n5. cxd4 (captures a pawn)\n6. g5 (gains space, but not urgent)\n\nLet's check Qb8+:\n- Qb8+ Kh7 (only move)\n- Then Qxc7 (captures rook with check), Black must respond:\n    - ... Rxc7 Qxc7 (White wins a rook)\n    - ... Re8 (blocks, but then Qxe8+)\n\nBut after Qb8+ Kh7, Qxc7, Black can play Be5+ (discovered check), but White can block with Kg1 or Kg3.\n\nAlternatively, after Qb8+ Kh7, Qxc7, Black has Be5+ Kg1 (or Kg3), then Rxc7, Qxe5, White is up a queen for a rook and bishop, which is a decisive material advantage.\n\nIs Qxg6 safe? Qxg6 is not check, and after ...Be5+ White's king is exposed.\n\nIs Qxc7 safe immediately? Qxc7 Rxc7, Qxc7, White is up a queen for a rook and bishop, but Black can try to activate.\n\nQb8+ is forcing and seems best.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nQb8+\n```"
