When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This wins a piece, and after Black recaptures with the king (d7xe7), White can try to win with the extra bishop.\n2. **f5f6**: King advances, but does not immediately threaten anything.\n3. **f5g5**: King moves toward the kingside, but Black's f4 pawn is dangerous.\n4. **f5e5**: King centralizes, but does not threaten anything.\n5. **f5g4**: King moves toward the kingside, but again, Black's f4 pawn is dangerous.\n6. **f5f4**: King captures pawn, but then Black can play ...Nd5, attacking the bishop and threatening ...Nxb4.\n7. **f5e4**: King moves toward the center, but not as strong as capturing the knight.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **b4e7** wins a piece outright. After b4e7 d7e7, White is up a bishop for two pawns. The remaining pawns are not dangerous, and White should win easily.\n- All other moves do not win material and allow Black to keep the knight, which can be tricky in endgames.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to capture the knight with the bishop.\n\n```\nb4e7\n```"
