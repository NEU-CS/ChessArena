When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Kg1: Only blocks mate for one move, but after Qxh2+ Kf2 Qxg2# is mate.\n2. Qh6: Defends h2, but after Qxh2+ Qxh2 Bxh2 Kxh2, White is still up material.\n3. Qxg6+: Forces Black to recapture, but doesn't stop mate.\n4. Rf3: Defends h3, but after Qxh2+ Qxh2 Bxh2 Kxh2, again White is up material.\n5. Rg1: Defends g2, but doesn't address h2.\n6. Rf2: Defends h2 directly.\n\nLet's check Qh6:\n- Qh6 defends h2, so Qxh2+ Qxh2 Bxh2 Kxh2, White is up a rook for a pawn.\n\nLet's check Rf2:\n- Rf2 directly defends h2, so Qxh2+ Rxh2 Bxh2 Kxh2, again White is up a rook for a pawn.\n\nBetween Qh6 and Rf2, Qh6 keeps the queen active and on the kingside, which is preferable.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQh6\n```"
