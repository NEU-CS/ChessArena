When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White must be careful.\n\n- **b7**:  \n  - Rxb7, and White loses the pawn.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Rd6+** looks very strong, as it checks the king and can win the d3 pawn or the rook on b7 if Black is careless.\n\nLet's check the main line after **Rd6+**:\n- If **Kc5**, then **Rc6+** and Black must play Kd4 or Kb5. If Kd4, then Rxb7 and White wins the rook.\n- If **Kxe4**, then **Rxd3** and White wins the dangerous pawn.\n- If **Kc4**, then **Rc6+** again, and the king is driven away.\n\nTherefore, **Rd6+** is the best move.\n\n```\nRd6+\n```"
