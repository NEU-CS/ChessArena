If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

It gets the king to safety, connects the rooks, and keeps the initiative. White's queen is awkwardly placed, and Black can follow up with e5, e6, or d3 depending on White's response.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nO-O-O\n```"
