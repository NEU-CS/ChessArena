If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black must reply with Rxc8, after which White can continue the attack.\n2. **Qxf7+**: Immediate check, but after Qxf7, Black can play Qxf7 or Kh8.\n3. **Nxf7**: Forks queen and rook, but after Qxf7, White can play Qxf7+ and then Rxf7.\n4. **Qxb5**: Captures a pawn, but less forcing.\n5. **Qxa8**: Captures a rook, but not with check.\n\nLet's look at the most forcing moves: **Qxc8+** and **Qxf7+**.\n\n**Qxc8+**:\n- Qxc8+ Rxc8\n- Now, White can play Nxg6 (forking rook and pawn), but Black can play fxg6.\n- Alternatively, White can play Rae1, doubling rooks.\n\n**Qxf7+**:\n- Qxf7+ Qxf7 (if Black takes)\n- Nxf7 Kxf7\n- Re5 (threatening Rxb5 and Re7+)\n- But Black is up material.\n\n**Nxf7**:\n- Nxf7 Qxf7\n- Qxf7+ Kxf7\n- Rae1 (threatening Re7+)\n- But Black can play Rc7.\n\n**Qxc8+** seems the most forcing and wins material immediately.\n\n**Calculation after Qxc8+ Rxc8:**\n- Now, White can play Nxg6, attacking the rook on c8 and threatening Ne7+.\n- If fxg6, then Nxg6, and White is threatening Ne7+.\n- Alternatively, after Qxc8+ Rxc8, White can play Rae1, doubling rooks on the e-file.\n\nBut let's check if Qxc8+ is safe:\n- Qxc8+ Rxc8\n- Nxg6 fxg6\n- Re5 (threatening Ne7+ and Rxb5)\n\nAlternatively, after Qxc8+, White is up an exchange and can continue to press.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\nQxc8+\n```"
