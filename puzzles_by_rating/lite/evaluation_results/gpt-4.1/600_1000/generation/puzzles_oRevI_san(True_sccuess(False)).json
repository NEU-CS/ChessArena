If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Possible squares: e6, g6, g5, Ke5 (but e5 is covered by the rook).\n   - If Kg6, then White can play Rf6+ and the king is forced to h7 or h5, but h5 is occupied by White's king.\n   - If Ke6, then White can play Rb7, threatening Rxb6 and b6 is pinned to the king.\n\n2. **g4+**\n   - Black's king can go to f4 or e4.\n   - If Kf4, then White can play Rf7+ and the king is forced to e5 or g5.\n   - If Ke4, then White can play Re7+ and the king is forced to d4 or f4.\n\n**Other moves:**\n- Rh8: Not a check, doesn't threaten anything immediate.\n- b4: Not urgent.\n- a3, a4: Not urgent.\n- g3: Not urgent.\n\n**Best move:**\nBetween Rf7+ and g4+, both are checks, but Rf7+ keeps the rook active and may force the king to a worse square. Let's see the lines:\n\n**Line 1: Rf7+**\n- If Ke6, White can play Rb7, threatening Rxb6.\n- If Kg6, White can play Rf6+ and the king is forced to h7, after which White can play Rxb6.\n- If Kg5, White can play Rg7+ and the king is forced to f4 or h5 (h5 is occupied).\n\n**Line 2: g4+**\n- If Kf4, White can play Rf7+ and the king is forced to e5 or g5.\n- If Ke4, White can play Re7+ and the king is forced to d4 or f4.\n\n**Evaluation:**\nRf7+ is more forcing and keeps the rook active, while g4+ may allow Black to escape.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRf7+\n```"
