When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black can block with ...Kf5 or ...Kh7, but after ...Kf5, White has Qxe8.\n- e4e7: Rook to e7, attacks f7 pawn, but doesn't give check.\n- e4h4: Rook to h4, check. Black can play ...gxh4, and White loses the rook.\n- e4g4: Rook to g4, check. Black can play ...Kh6, but then White has Rxh4+.\n- e4f4: Rook to f4, check. Black can play ...Kh6, but then White has Rxg4.\n- a5a6: Pawn push, not urgent.\n- g3g4: Pawn push, not urgent.\n\nImmediate threats:\n- Black is threatening Qxe4, which is mate.\n\nSo, White must give check or defend the e4 rook.\n\nLet's check e4e8:\n1. e4e8 Qxe8 (forced, otherwise White wins)\n2. f7 (threatening f8=Q)\nBut Black can play ...Qxe8, and White loses the rook.\n\nWhat about e4e7?\n1. e4e7 (threatens f7 pawn, but Black can play Qxe4, which is mate)\n\nWhat about e4g4+?\n1. e4g4+ Kh6 (forced)\n2. Rxg4 (now White is up a rook, but Black can play Qf1+ and mate is coming)\n\nWhat about e4f4+?\n1. e4f4+ Kh6 (forced)\n2. Rxg4 (again, Black can play Qf1+ and mate is coming)\n\nWhat about e4h4+?\n1. e4h4+ gxh4+ (forced)\n2. Rxh4 (but Black can play Qf1+ and mate is coming)\n\nWhat about e4e3?\n1. e4e3 (defends the third rank, but Black can play Qxe3, which is mate)\n\nWhat about a5a6?\n1. a5a6 (doesn't address the mate threat)\n\nWhat about g3g4?\n1. g3g4 (doesn't address the mate threat)\n\nSo, White must give check.\n\nLet's check e4e8:\n1. e4e8 Qxe8 (forced)\n2. f7 (threatens f8=Q)\nBut Black can play Qxe8, and White loses the rook.\n\nWhat about e4e6?\n1. e4e6 (attacks the king, but not a check)\n\nWhat about e4e5?\n1. e4e5 (not a check)\n\nWhat about e4e2?\n1. e4e2 (defends the second rank, but Black can play Qxe4, which is mate)\n\nSo, the only way to avoid immediate mate is to give check.\n\nLet's check e4g4+:\n1. e4g4+ Kh6\n2. Rxg4 (now White is up a rook, but Black can play Qf1+)\n3. Kh4 (forced)\n4. Rxh2 (Black can take the pawn)\nBut Black's queen and rook are too strong.\n\nAlternatively, after e4g4+ Kh6, what about Re4-e8?\nBut Black can play Qxe8.\n\nAlternatively, after e4g4+ Kh6, what about f7?\nBut Black can play Qf1+.\n\nAlternatively, after e4g4+ Kh6, what about a5a6?\nBut Black can play Qf1+.\n\nSo, the only way to avoid mate is to give check.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne4g4\n```"
