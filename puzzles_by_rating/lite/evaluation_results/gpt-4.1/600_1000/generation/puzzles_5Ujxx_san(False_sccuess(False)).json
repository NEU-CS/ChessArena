When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is in the center but can castle kingside.\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- White's knight on e4 is threatening to jump to f6+ or d6+.\n- White's queen and rook are well placed for pressure.\n- Black's king is not very safe, but can castle.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **e8g8 (castle kingside):** This gets the king to safety and connects the rooks.\n2. **d5e4:** Captures the knight, but after dxe4, White's queen and rook become more active.\n3. **f5e4:** Same as above, but with the pawn.\n4. **e7f8:** Retreats the queen, but passive.\n5. **a8d8:** Centralizes the rook.\n6. **b7b6:** Defends the b5 pawn.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n- If 1...e8g8 (castle), White may try Nc3, Qe3, or d4, but Black's king is safer.\n- If 1...d5e4 or f5e4, White recaptures and opens the e-file, which could be dangerous for Black's king.\n- Castling is the safest and most logical move, as it removes the king from the center and prepares to bring the rook into play.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to castle kingside.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
