When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves: g7f7, g7h6, e5g5, e5g3\n\nMaterial:\n- Black: King on g7, Rook on e7, Pawn on f6, Pawns on b5, c5, h5, Queen on e5\n- White: Queen on d8, Rook on g3, King on h2, Pawns on a2, f2, g2, g3\n\nThreats:\n- White's queen is very active, and the rook on g3 is also pressuring.\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed, but not immediately in danger.\n- Black's queen and rook are centralized, but White has a strong initiative.\n\nLegal moves:\n1. g7f7: King to f7 (walks into a pin along the 7th rank, possibly dangerous)\n2. g7h6: King to h6 (walks into a dangerous corner, could be mated)\n3. e5g5: Queen to g5 (attacks rook on g3, also covers g3 and g7 squares)\n4. e5g3: Queen takes rook on g3 (captures material, but let's check for tactics)\n\nLet's check e5g3:\n- 36... Qxg3+ 37. fxg3 (forced)\n- Now, Black is up a rook for a pawn, but White's queen is very active.\n\nIs there a mate threat after Qxg3+? Let's check:\n- 36... Qxg3+ 37. fxg3 (forced)\n- Now, Black can play ...Re2, attacking the queen and threatening mate on g2.\n- But White's queen can defend.\n\nAlternatively, let's check e5g5:\n- 36... Qg5 attacks the rook on g3, but White can play Qxe7+ and win the rook.\n\nLet's check king moves:\n- 36... Kf7: 37. Qg8# is mate.\n- 36... Kh6: 37. Qh8+ Rh7 38. Qf8+ Rg7 39. Qxg7# is mate.\n\nSo, king moves lose immediately.\n\nBetween e5g3 and e5g5, e5g3 wins a rook. Let's check for any immediate tactics for White after Qxg3+.\n\n36... Qxg3+ 37. fxg3 Re2 (threatening mate on g2)\nBut White can play Qd7+ and force a queen trade or perpetual.\n\nBut still, Qxg3+ is the best move, as it wins a rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5g3\n```"
