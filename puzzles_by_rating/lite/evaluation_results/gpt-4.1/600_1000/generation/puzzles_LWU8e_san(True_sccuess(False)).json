If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Black must address this immediately.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- Defend c7 with Rd7, Rd6, or Rd5.\n- Move the king (Kc8 or Ka8) \u2013 but both allow Qxc7#.\n- Move the queen to c7 (not possible).\n- Move the rook to c8 (Rc8), defending c7.\n\n**Let's check Rc8:**\n- Rc8 defends c7, so Qxc7 is no longer mate.\n- After Rc8, White can try d5, but Black can respond.\n- Rc8 is the only move that directly prevents mate.\n\n**Other candidate moves:**\n- Rd7, Rd6, Rd5 all defend c7, but Rc8 is more flexible as it also keeps the rook on the back rank.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n- No checks for Black that are meaningful.\n- No captures that change the situation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only move to avoid immediate mate is:\n\n```\nRc8\n```"
