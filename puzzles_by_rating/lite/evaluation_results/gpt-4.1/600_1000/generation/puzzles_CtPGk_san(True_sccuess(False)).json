If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

The rook on e8 must be defended or moved.\n- **Rce7** is the best move: it defends the rook on e8, so Qxe8+ is not possible, and also keeps the c7 rook defended.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRce7\n```"
