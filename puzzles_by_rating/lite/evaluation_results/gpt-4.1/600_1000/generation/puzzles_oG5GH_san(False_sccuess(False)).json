When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position:\n\n**Position:**\n- Black to move.\n- Material is equal.\n- White's light-squared bishop is active on d5, eyeing b7 and f7.\n- Black's queen is on c6, bishop on f5, and both are well-placed.\n- Black's king is on g8, relatively safe.\n- White's king is on g1, also safe.\n- White's pawn structure is solid, but Black has a slight space advantage on the queenside.\n- No immediate tactical threats from White.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. **c6d5**: Exchange queens. This relieves pressure but leads to a more drawish endgame.\n2. **f5d3**: Bishop attacks the rook on e1, but White can defend easily.\n3. **f5g6**: Retreat, but not necessary.\n4. **b8d7**: Develops the knight, connects rooks.\n5. **c5c4**: Gains space, but White can respond with b3.\n6. **g8h8** or **g8f8**: King safety, but not urgent.\n7. **b7b5**: Expands on the queenside, but could weaken c6.\n\n**Deeper Analysis:**\n- **b8d7** is a natural developing move, connecting the rooks and preparing to contest the center. It also supports the c5 pawn and prepares ...Nf6 if needed.\n- **c6d5**: After exd5, Black's bishop on f5 is strong, but White's center is solid.\n- **c5c4**: After b3, White can challenge the queenside.\n- **f5d3**: After Bxc6, bxc6, White has a slight initiative.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **b8d7** is the most flexible, develops a piece, and keeps options open. It does not commit to any exchanges and prepares to double rooks or play ...Nf6.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nb8d7\n```"
