If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After Kh3 or Kf3, the knight can return or go to f4, but it doesn't seem to gain much.\n2. **Nxe4+**: This captures a pawn with check. After Nxe4, Nxe4+, White's king moves, and Black is up a pawn.\n3. **Nd7**: Retreats the knight, but doesn't seem to do much.\n4. **Nxd5**: Captures a pawn, but after cxd5, White gets a strong passed pawn.\n5. **Nxg4**: Captures a pawn, but White can respond with Nxg4, and Black loses a knight.\n6. **Ng8, Ne8**: Retreats, passive.\n7. **Kh6**: Moves the king, but doesn't seem to do much.\n8. **b5, a5**: Pushes pawns, but White's a-pawn is more dangerous.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Nxe4+**: \n    - Nxe4+ dxe4 (if White recaptures with the pawn), then Black has a passed pawn on d5, but White's king is active.\n    - If White doesn't recapture, Black is up a pawn.\n- **Nh5+**: \n    - Kh3 (forced), then Nf4+ (another check), Kg3, Ne2+, Kf3, Nd4+, and Black can repeat or try to win a pawn.\n- **Nxd5**: \n    - cxd5, then Black's knight is attacked, and White has a strong passed pawn.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **Nxe4+** wins a pawn with check and forces White's king to move. After that, Black can try to centralize the king and push for a win.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nNxe4+\n```"
