When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Rf7 Rxf7 25. exf7+ Kxf7 (if Qxf7, then Qf3 wins the bishop on g7)\n- 24. Rf7 Qb6 (defending f7) 25. Qf3 (threatening Qf7#) Qd8 26. Bc4 (threatening d6) and White is pressing.\n\nLet's calculate d1g4:\n- 24. Qg4 c4+ 25. Kh1 (or Be2) and White is fine, but not as strong as Rf7.\n\nLet's calculate d1f3:\n- 24. Qf3 Qxa2 (grabbing a pawn) 25. d6 cxd6 26. b6 and White has strong play, but Black has counterplay.\n\nLet's calculate d5d6:\n- 24. d6 cxd6 25. Bc4+ Kh8 26. Qxd6 and White is better, but not decisive.\n\nBest move:\nThe move 24. Rf7 is very strong, invading the 7th rank, attacking the bishop, and threatening Qf3/Qg4 ideas. Black cannot take on f7 without losing the bishop, and White's attack is very strong.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf1f7\n```"
