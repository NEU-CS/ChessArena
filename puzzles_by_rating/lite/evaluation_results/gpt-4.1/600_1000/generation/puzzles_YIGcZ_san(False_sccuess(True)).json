White can play Qe8+ and then Qg8# if the king moves to h7 or f8, but if the king stays on h8, White has no immediate mate.\n2. g8f8: King moves to f8. White can play Qe8# (checkmate).\n3. g8h7: King moves to h7. White can play Qe8 and then Qg8#.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- g8f8 loses immediately to Qe8#.\n- g8h7 allows Qe8, and after ...g6, Qg8# is mate.\n- g8h8 is the only move that avoids immediate mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only move that does not lose immediately is to move the king to h8.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng8h8\n```"
