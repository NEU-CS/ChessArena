When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Rd8+ (forcing the Black king to move, possibly to e7 or g7)\n2. e4 (challenging the knight and opening the center)\n3. b3/a3 (preparing to activate queenside pawns)\n4. Kh3 (improving king safety, but not urgent)\n5. Rd5 (attacking the knight and possibly the pawns)\n\nLet's calculate:\n- Rd8+ Kf7 (only move), then Rd7+ Ke6 (if Kf6, then e4 is strong), but Black's king can hide.\n- e4 is interesting: if Nxe3+ Kf3 Nxd1 Rxd1, White gives up the exchange but gets rid of the knight and opens the position for the rook.\n- Rd5 attacks the knight, but Nxe3+ is annoying.\n\nI think the most forcing move is:\n```\nRd8+\n```\nThis checks the king and forces it to a worse square, keeping the initiative."
