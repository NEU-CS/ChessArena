If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is exposed, and White's rook and knight are active. Black's bishop on e3 is strong, but the rook on d8 is tied to the d7 pawn.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rh7+ (forces the king to h8 or f8; if Kxh7, then Nf6# is mate)\n- Rxg6+ (captures a pawn, but doesn't threaten immediate mate)\n- Nf6 (threatens mate on h7, but the knight can be taken by the bishop)\n- Nxc5 (captures a pawn, but less forcing)\n- f4 (prepares to open lines, but less direct)\n- d7-d8=Q is not possible yet.\n\nLet's check Rh7+:\n1. Rh7+ Kxh7 (forced)\n2. Nf6+ (now the king is on h7, and Nf6# is checkmate, since the g8 and h8 squares are covered by the knight and pawn, and the king can't escape)\n\nSo, Rh7+ is a forced mate in two.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRh7+\n```"
