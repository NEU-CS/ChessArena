When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Both moves are passive and lose material.\n- **g4e2**: Queen blocks, but after Qxe2, White loses the queen for a queen.\n- **e1e2**: Rook blocks, offering a trade of queens after Qxe2+ Rxe2, and then Black can play Rxe2+ Kxe2, simplifying the position. White will be down material but avoids immediate mate.\n\n**Is there any tactical resource?**\n- White's queen and bishop are both attacking g7, but the knight on g6 defends it.\n- No immediate mate or perpetual check for White.\n\n**Best move:**\n- The only move that doesn't lose the queen immediately and keeps some hope is **e1e2**, offering a trade of queens and simplifying the position. All other moves lose more material or allow mate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne1e2\n```"
