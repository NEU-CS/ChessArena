When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Let's check:\n\n1. h7g7+ Kg4\n2. Rg4+ Kf5 (only move)\n3. Kxh4\n\nBut then Black can play Re4+ and get counterplay.\n\nAlternatively, h7f7+ Ke6, then Rf6+ Ke5, Rxb6, but Black can try to push pawns.\n\nIs there a forced mate? Let's check h7f7+:\n\n1. h7f7+ Ke6 (if Kg6, then Rf6# is mate)\n2. Rf6+ Ke5 (if Kxf6, then Rxb6+)\n3. Rxb6\n\nBut Black can try to push pawns.\n\nAlternatively, h7g7+ Kg4, Rg4+ Kf5, Kxh4, Re4+.\n\nIs there a better move? What about h7h8? That doesn't threaten anything immediate.\n\nWhat about h7e7+? Kf6, then Rxe8, but then Black can push pawns.\n\nWhat about h7f7+ Kg6? Rf6+ Kg7, Rxb6, but Black can push pawns.\n\nWhat about pawn moves? Not urgent.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the best move is to check with the rook and try to force the king away.\n\nLet's try h7f7+:\n\n1. h7f7+ Ke6 (if Kg6, then Rf6# is mate)\n2. Rf6+ Ke5 (if Kxf6, then Rxb6+)\n3. Rxb6\n\nThis wins the b6 pawn and keeps the king active.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh7f7\n```"
