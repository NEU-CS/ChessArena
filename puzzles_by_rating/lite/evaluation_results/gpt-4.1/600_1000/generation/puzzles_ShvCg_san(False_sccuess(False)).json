When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Qg2#, not possible as knight covers g2. If Qxg4, White can play Qxg4, and after hxg4, White is up material. If Qf3, White can play Qxf3 Nxf3#, but that's not mate as White's king has escape squares.\n- **d1h5**: If Qh5, threatens Qxh4, but Black can play Nf3+ and after Nxf3 Qxh5, White is fine.\n- **c1h6**: If Bh6, attacks the queen, but after Qg2#, it's mate, so not possible.\n- **f2f3**: If f3, Nxf3+ is dangerous.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **h2g4** (Nh2-g4) is the best, as it attacks the queen and covers key squares, and the knight is no longer pinned to the mate threat.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nh2g4\n```"
