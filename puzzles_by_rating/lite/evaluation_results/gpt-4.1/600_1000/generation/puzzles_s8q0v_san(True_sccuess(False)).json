If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Nxh7 Kxh7 (if Black takes)\n- 21. Bxf7+ Qxf7 (if Black takes with queen)\n- 22. Qg5 (threatening Qh5+ and mate ideas)\n\nBut after 20...Kxh7, White can play Qg5, threatening Qh5+ and mate on h8. Black has to defend with Qh6 or Qf6, but White can continue the attack.\n\nAlternatively, after 20. Nxh7, if Black plays Qxh7, White can play Bxf7+ and after Rxf7, Qg5, with strong threats.\n\n**Nxh7** seems to be the most promising, as it opens up Black's king and creates immediate tactical threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nNxh7\n```"
