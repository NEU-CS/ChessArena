Nh3+**\n- If Kh1, then Rxh2# is mate.\n- If Qxh3, then Qxc4 wins a piece.\n- If Bxh3, then Qxc4 wins a piece.\n\nBut after Nh3+, White must play Kh1, and then Rxh2# is checkmate.\n\n**Double-check:**\n- Nh3+ Kh1 Rxh2# is mate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The move Nh3+ leads to forced mate.\n\nSo the best move is:\n```\nNh3+\n```"
