Let's see: 1. Rxc6 Rxd4 2. h3 (or h4) and White has some activity, but Black is up a pawn.\n- Rc5: Attacks the h5 pawn, but Black can defend with Rb6 or Rb2.\n- Rc4: Defends d4, but allows Rxc4 dxc4, simplifying into a pawn endgame, which is likely lost for White due to Black's outside passed pawns.\n- d5: Pushes the passed pawn, but Black can play cxd5, and after exd5, Rxd4, Black is up a pawn.\n- f4: Tries to create counterplay on the kingside.\n- h3/h4/g4: Try to activate the kingside pawns.\n\nThe most active try is 1. Rxc6. After 1...Rxd4, White can try to activate the kingside pawns and hope for counterplay. Other moves are too passive or lose material.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxc6\n```"
