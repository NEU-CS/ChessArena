If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Rxg3+ 2. fxg3 (if hxg3, Qxg3#) Qxg3+ 3. fxg3 (forced) Rxg3+ 4. Kh1 (forced) Rh8+ 5. Qh5 Rxh5#\n\nBut after 1... Rxg3+, White can play fxg3, but then Qxg3+ is not possible because the pawn is on g3. Let's check the sequence:\n\n1... Rxg3+ 2. fxg3 Qxg3+ 3. Kh1 (forced) Rh8+ 4. Qh5 Rxh5#\n\nSo, **Rxg3+** leads to a forced mate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxg3+\n```"
