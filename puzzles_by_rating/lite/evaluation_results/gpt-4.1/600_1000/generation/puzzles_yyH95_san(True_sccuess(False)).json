You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

If we play R6e7, the rook on f6 moves away, and the king is more exposed.\n\nTherefore, **R8e7** is the best move, as it maintains the rook on f6 for defense.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nR8e7\n```"
