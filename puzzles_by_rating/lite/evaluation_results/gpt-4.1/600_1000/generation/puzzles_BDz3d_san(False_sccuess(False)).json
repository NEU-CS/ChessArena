When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxe5 Nxe5, White wins a queen for a queen, but then Black can play dxc2, threatening c1=Q.\n- If 2. cxd3, then Qxe2+ wins the queen.\n- If 2. Bxc6+ bxc6, then Qxe5+ Be7, and Black is fine.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1...d3\n- 2. Qxe5 Nxe5\n- 3. Bxb7 Bxb7\n- Black is up a piece.\n\nAlternatively:\n1...d3\n- 2. cxd3 Qxe2+ (wins the queen)\n\nAlternatively:\n1...d3\n- 2. Bxc6+ bxc6\n- 3. Qxe5+ Be7\n- Black is fine.\n\n**Conclusion:** The move 1...d3 is very strong, threatening dxe2+ and opening up tactics against White's king and queen.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd4d3\n```"
