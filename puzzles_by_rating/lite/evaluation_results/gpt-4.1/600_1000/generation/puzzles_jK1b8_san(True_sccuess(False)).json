If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Qxa6+ Qxa6 (forced)\n2. bxa6 (not possible, as pawn is already on a6 and would be captured)\nSo after Qxa6+, White must recapture with the queen, leading to a queen trade.\n\nAlternatively, if White doesn't recapture, Black is up a queen.\n\nTherefore, Qxa6+ is a strong move, removing White's biggest threat and simplifying to a winning endgame.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nQxa6+\n```"
