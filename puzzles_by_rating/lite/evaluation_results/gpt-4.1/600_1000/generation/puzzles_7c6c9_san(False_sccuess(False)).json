When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

(Black to move):**\n- Black: King on g8, Queen on d8, Rooks on c8 and f8, Bishops on e7 and d7, Knights on c6 and d5, pawns on a6, b7, e6, f7, g7, h6.\n- White: King on g1, Queen on d3, Rooks on a1 and e1, Bishops on b1 and c1, Knights on f3 and g5, pawns on a3, b2, d4, f2, g2, h2.\n\n**Key points:**\n- White has a knight on g5, threatening Qh7# if the f-pawn moves.\n- Black's knight on d5 is well placed, controlling key squares.\n- Black's queen and rooks are centralized.\n- White's queen and knights are active, and White has some kingside pressure.\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- White threatens Qh7# if the f-pawn moves.\n- White's knight on g5 is a nuisance, and the queen on d3 eyes h7.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **h6g5**: Captures the knight on g5, but after Qh7#, it's mate. So this is not possible.\n2. **f7f5**: Blocks the queen's access to h7, but weakens e6 and the kingside.\n3. **g7g6**: Creates luft for the king and attacks the knight on g5.\n4. **h6h5**: Attacks the knight on g5.\n5. **d7g5**: Bishop captures knight, but the bishop is on e7, so not possible.\n6. **d8c7**: Queen move to c7, defending h7.\n7. **f8e8**: Rook to e8, defending e7 bishop and centralizing.\n8. **c6f6**: Not possible, knight can't go there.\n9. **e7g5**: Bishop captures knight on g5, but bishop is on e7, so possible.\n\n**Let's check e7xg5:**\n- 15... Be7xg5\n- If Nxg5, then Qxg5, and Black is fine.\n\nBut after 15... Be7xg5, White can play Qh7#, so this is not possible.\n\n**Let's check g7g6:**\n- 15... g7g6\n- If Nxe6, Bxe6, Qxg6+ fxg6, Rxe6, Black is under pressure but not mated.\n- If Nxf7, Rxf7, Qxg6+ Kf8, Bxg5 Bxg5, Nxg5, Black is still holding.\n\n**Let's check h6h5:**\n- 15... h6h5\n- If Qh7#, not possible, as h5 blocks the queen.\n- If Nxe6, Bxe6, Qxg6+ fxg6, Rxe6, Black is under pressure.\n\n**Let's check d8c7:**\n- 15... Qc7, defending h7.\n\nBut after Qc7, White can play Qh7#, and it's mate.\n\n**Let's check f7f5:**\n- 15... f7f5\n- If Nxe6, Bxe6, Qg3, Black is fine.\n\n**Best move:**\n- The most solid move is **g7g6**, attacking the knight and creating luft for the king. It also prevents immediate Qh7# threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng7g6\n```"
