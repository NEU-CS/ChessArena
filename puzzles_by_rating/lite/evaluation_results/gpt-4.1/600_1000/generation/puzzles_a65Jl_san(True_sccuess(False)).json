If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Rxe6 Bxe6? is not possible, since the bishop is on d5 and can't capture on e6.\n- 36. Rxe6 fxe6? is not possible, since the pawn is on f7.\n- After 36. Rxe6, Black could try ...Bxe6, but that's not legal.\n- After 36. Rxe6, Black may try ...f6, but then 37. Rxa6 wins another pawn.\n- After 36. Rxe6, Black may try ...Kxe6, but then the bishop is hanging.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Rxe6** wins a pawn for free, threatens to win more, and keeps the rook active. This is the best move.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRxe6\n```"
