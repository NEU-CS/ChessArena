When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After Kc2, Qa4+ repeats, but doesn't improve Black's position.\n2. **Qd7**: Defends d8, but White can play Nxc5, attacking b7 and threatening Qd7.\n3. **Qb3**: Attacks d1 and b2, but White can defend easily.\n4. **Qa2**: Checks, but White can block with Ke1 or Kd2.\n5. **Nd7**: Defends d8, but White can play Qd6, threatening Qc7#.\n6. **Qd4**: Centralizes the queen, attacks f2, but White can play Nxd4.\n7. **Qf4+**: Forces White's king to c2 or e2, but doesn't improve Black's position.\n8. **Kb8**: Improves king safety, but White can continue with Nxc5.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Qa1+** is a forcing check and may allow Black to repeat moves if needed, but doesn't improve the position.\n- **Qd7** defends d8, but White's Nxc5 is strong.\n- **Nd7** covers d8 and c5, but White can play Qd6.\n\nAfter careful consideration, **Qd7** is the most solid move, defending d8 and preparing to meet White's threats. If White plays Nxc5, then Black can play Qc6, defending b7 and c5.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQd7\n```"
