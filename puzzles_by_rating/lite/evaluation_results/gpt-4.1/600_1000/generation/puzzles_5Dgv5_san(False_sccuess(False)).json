When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White plays Bf4, then ...Ng6 attacks the bishop again.\n- **f8d8**: Contesting the open d-file, but White's rook is already there.\n- **c7c6**: Solidifies the center, gives the king a flight square.\n- **g7g6**: Prepares to push h5, but weakens the dark squares.\n\n**Calculation for e5g4:**\n- 17...Ng4 attacks the bishop on g5.\n- If 18. Rxf8+ Rxf8 19. Bh4 (retreat), then ...Nxh2 wins a pawn.\n- If 18. Bf4, then ...Ng6 attacks the bishop again.\n\n**Calculation for f8d8:**\n- 17...Rd8, White can play Rxd8+ Kxd8, and Black loses the right to castle, but the king is not in immediate danger.\n\n**Calculation for c7c6:**\n- 17...c6, solid move, but not very ambitious.\n\n**Calculation for e5c4:**\n- 17...Nc4 attacks b2, but after 18. Bc1, the knight is not doing much.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **e5g4** is the most active, attacking the bishop and possibly threatening ...Nxh2.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne5g4\n```"
