Black also has a passed pawn on the kingside (g4).\n- White's king is central and can try to support the d-pawn or invade on the queenside.\n- The move d4 is possible, but after exd4, the White king can recapture, but then Black's king is closer to the kingside pawns.\n- Moving the king to c6 or d6 could threaten to invade on the queenside and support the d-pawn's advance.\n- Moving the king to c4 or c5 may allow Black to push e4, gaining space and supporting the g4 pawn.\n\nLet's consider each move:\n\n1. **d4**  \n   - If d4, exd4, Kxd4, Black's king is closer to the kingside pawns and can try to create a passed pawn. White's king is a bit far from the kingside action.\n   - Alternatively, after d4, if Black does not take, White can push d5 next.\n\n2. **Kd6**  \n   - This move keeps the king central and supports the d-pawn. It also threatens to invade on the queenside if Black is not careful.\n\n3. **Kc6**  \n   - Similar to Kd6, but more aggressively heading to the queenside. If Black ignores, White can play Kb7 and try to invade.\n\n4. **Kc5**  \n   - This move keeps the king on the queenside, but doesn't support the d-pawn as directly.\n\n5. **Kc4**  \n   - This move is less active, as it moves away from the center and the d-pawn.\n\n**Best move:**\n\nBetween Kd6 and Kc6, Kd6 keeps maximum centralization, supports the d-pawn, and keeps options open. Kc6 is also tempting, but Kd6 is more flexible.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nKd6\n```"
