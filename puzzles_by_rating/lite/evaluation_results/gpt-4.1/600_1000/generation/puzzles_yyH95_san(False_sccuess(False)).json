When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White exchanges rooks, Black can recapture with the queen, maintaining material balance and possibly simplifying the position. It also defends the a7 pawn, which could become a passed pawn if White is not careful.\n\n- **e8e7 or e6e7**: Both moves put a rook on e7, but White can double rooks on the 7th rank, which is generally dangerous for Black. However, with the queen on e5, Black has some control.\n\n- **King moves**: All king moves (g7g8, g7f8, g7g6) seem passive or risky, as the king could become exposed to checks or attacks.\n\n**Best move:**\n\nAfter considering all options, **e5c7** stands out as the best move. It attacks White's rook, defends the a7 pawn, and keeps the queen active. It also forces White to respond, possibly leading to exchanges that could simplify the position and reduce White's attacking chances.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne5c7\n```"
