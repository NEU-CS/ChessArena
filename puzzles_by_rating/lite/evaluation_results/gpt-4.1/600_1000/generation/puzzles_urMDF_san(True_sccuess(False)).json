If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If ...Rxf7, then Qg5 threatens mate on g7 and h6.\n2. **Nxe6**: Attacks the rook on g7 and threatens a fork.\n3. **Be4**: Defends h3 and attacks the queen.\n4. **Qa5**: Attacks the rook on a8.\n5. **f3**: Kicks the queen, but weakens the king.\n\nLet's calculate **Nxf7+**:\n\n1. Nxf7+ Rxf7 (forced)\n2. Qg5! (threatening Qxg7# and Qh6#)\n   - If ...Bxf1, then Qxg7#.\n   - If ...Qxg5, then Bxg5, White is up material and Black's attack is gone.\n   - If ...Qe2, then Bxf7+ Kxf7, Qf6+ Kg8, Rg1, White is winning.\n\nAlternatively, after Nxf7+, if ...Kxf7, then Qf4+ and White wins the bishop on h3.\n\n**Nxe6**: \n- Nxe6 attacks the rook, but Black can play Qxe6, and White loses the knight.\n\n**Be4**: \n- Be4 attacks the queen and defends h3, but Black can play Qxg5, Bxg5, Bxf1, and White loses the exchange.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Nxf7+** is a forcing move that leads to a decisive attack or material gain.\n\nMy move:\n```\nNxf7+\n```"
