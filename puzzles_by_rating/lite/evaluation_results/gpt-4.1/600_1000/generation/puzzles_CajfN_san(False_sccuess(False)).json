When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If we can distract the rook or force a trade, we can promote. The rook on h6 can swing to h7 or h8, but Black's rook on d8 is guarding the queening square.\n\nWhat about:\n- h6h7+? If K moves, then d7d8=Q is possible if the rook is distracted.\n- e4f6: Check, if Kf7, then Rh7+ wins the bishop after K moves.\n\nLet's calculate e4f6:\n1. e4f6 Kf7 (forced)\n2. Rh7+ Ke6 (if Kf8, then Rh8+ Kf7, Rh7+ repeats)\n3. d7d8=Q Rxd8\n4. Kf3 (threatening mate on f6, but not immediate)\n\nAlternatively, e4f6+ is strong because it forces the king to f7, then Rh7+ picks up the bishop.\n\nLet's check:\n1. e4f6 Kf7\n2. Rh7+ Ke6 (if Kf8, then Rh8+ Kf7, Rh7+ repeats)\n3. Rh8 (threatening Rxd8 and d7d8=Q)\nBut after ...Bxf6, White is up material.\n\nAlternatively, e4f6+ Kf7 Rh7+ Ke6 Rh8 Bxf6 Rxd8 Bxd8, White is up a piece.\n\nBut let's check if there's a more direct way.\n\nWhat about h6h7+?\n1. h6h7+ Kf8 (if Kxh7, then d7d8=Q)\n2. h7h8=Q+ Kf7\n3. Qxd8, White wins.\n\nBut after h6h7+, Kf8, then d7d8=Q Rxd8 h7h8=Q+ Kf7 Qxd8, White wins.\n\nSo the best move is:\n```\nh6h7\n```"
