You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Qxg3+ 37. fxg3 Re2 38. Qd7+ Kg6 39. Qxb5 Rxa2, but White is up a queen for a rook and pawn, which is a losing endgame for Black.\n   - However, after 36... Qxg3+ 37. fxg3 Re2, if White plays Qd7+ Kg6, White can keep checking and eventually win.\n\n2. **Qg5**\n   - Defends h5, but White can play Qxe7+ and win the rook.\n\n3. **Kf7**\n   - White has Qg8# (checkmate).\n\n4. **Kh6**\n   - White has Qh8+ Rh7 (forced), Qxf6# (checkmate).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Qxg3+** is the only move that doesn't lose immediately, but Black is still lost after fxg3. All other moves lose instantly to mate or loss of material.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQxg3+\n```"
