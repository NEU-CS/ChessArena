When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Qxf7+ Kh8 3. Qf8+ Rxf8 4. Rxf8# is mate, so Bxf7 loses.\n- If 1...Rf8 2. Rxf8+ Kxf8 3. Bc5+ Kg8 4. Qf8# is mate, so Rf8 loses.\n- If 1...Kh8, White can try 2. Rf8+ Bg8 3. Qf7, but nothing immediate.\n- If 1...Qh2+ 2. Kxh2 Bxf7, but White's queen is not on h2.\n- If 1...Qe2, attacking g2, but White can defend.\n- If 1...Qd5, centralizing and defending e6.\n\n**Best Defensive Move:**\n- 1...Kh8 sidesteps any back rank issues and prepares to meet Rf8+ with Bg8.\n\n**Double-checking:**\n- 1...Kh8 2. Rf8+ Bg8 3. Qf7 (threatening mate) Rxf8 4. Qxf8 Qe3+ 5. Kh1 Qe6, Black can defend.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe safest move is to step off the back rank.\n\n```\nKh8\n```"
