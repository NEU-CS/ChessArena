When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...Rxg8, then White loses the queen for a rook, but let's see if there is a forced mate.\n2. **Qg7**: Threatens mate on b7, but Black can defend.\n3. **Qd8**: Checks the king, but Black can block with Bb8 or Re8.\n4. **Qg6**: No immediate threat.\n5. **Qe7**: Attacks the rook and threatens mate on e8, but Black can defend.\n6. **a4**: Prepares to open lines, but not urgent.\n\nLet's analyze **Qg8**:\n- 1. Qg8 Rxg8 (forced)\n- 2. Rxg8+ Bb8 (forced)\n- 3. Rxe8\n\nBut after 1. Qg8, Black cannot play Rxg8 because the rook is on e8, not g8. So 1. Qg8+ forces Rxg8, but there is no rook on g8. So 1. Qg8+ is check.\n\nAfter 1. Qg8+:\n- If Rxg8, White loses the queen.\n- But let's check if Black can block or escape.\n\nWait, Black's king is on a8, and the only piece that can block is the bishop on a7. But the bishop is already on a7, so after Qg8+, Black must play Bb8.\n\nSo:\n1. Qg8+ Bb8 (forced)\n2. Qxe8 (captures rook, threatens mate)\n\nAfter 2. Qxe8, White is up material and threatens Qxb8#.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n```\ng5g8\n```"
