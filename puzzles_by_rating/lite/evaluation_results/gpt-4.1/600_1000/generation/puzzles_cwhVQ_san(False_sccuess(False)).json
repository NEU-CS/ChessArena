When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...Qb5, White can play Nc3, developing and attacking d5.\n- **c1g5**: Forces the queen to move, but after ...Qg6, White has not gained much.\n- **b1c3**: Develops a piece, supports d5, and prepares to contest the center.\n- **d4d5**: After ...c5, the center is locked, and Black's bishop remains strong.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **c2c6** is the most direct and challenging move, attacking the pinned pawn on c6 and threatening to win material. Black cannot defend the pawn easily, and White can follow up with Nc3, increasing pressure.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc2c6\n```"
