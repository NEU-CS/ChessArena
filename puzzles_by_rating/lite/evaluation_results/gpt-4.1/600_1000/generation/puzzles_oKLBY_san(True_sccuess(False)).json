If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Qg4+  \n   - If Kxf2, Qxf5+ wins the bishop.\n   - If Kh2, Qg3+ and White must play Kh1, then Qh3# is mate.\n\nSo, Qg4+ is a very strong move, possibly leading to mate or winning material.\n\n**Double-checking for any better moves:**\n- Qe4+ is also a check, but after Kxf2, Qxf5+ is similar.\n- Qg4+ is more forcing and leads to mate if White goes to h2.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is the forcing check:\n\n```\nQg4+\n```"
