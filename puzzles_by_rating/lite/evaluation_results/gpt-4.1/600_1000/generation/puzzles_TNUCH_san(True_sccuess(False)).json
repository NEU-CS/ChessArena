If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is relatively safe for now.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- Rf3+ (forces the White king to move, possibly to e2 or d4)\n- Rf4 (attacks the c4 pawn)\n- Rf5 (attacks the knight)\n- Ke7 (centralizes king, but less active than rook moves)\n- Kg7 (retreat, not active)\n- Kxe5 (captures knight, but is illegal as the knight is protected by the bishop)\n- Pawn moves (h5, b5): h5 doesn't do much, b5 pushes the passed pawn.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- Rf3+ is forcing. After Kd4 or Ke2, Black can continue with Rf4+ or Rf4, attacking the c4 pawn.\n- Rf4 immediately attacks c4, but White can defend with Nf3.\n- Rf5 attacks the knight, but White can play Ng4+ or Nf3.\n- b5 is a thematic push, but White can play cxb5, and after Kxe5, White is still holding.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. Rf3+ Ke2 (if Kd4, then Rf4+ and White's king is exposed)\n   - Now Rf4, attacking c4, and White cannot defend with Nf3 because the knight is pinned to the king.\n   - If Nf3, then Rxf3 and White loses material.\n\nTherefore, **Rf3+** is the most forcing and best move, as it drives the king away and threatens to win the c4 pawn.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRf3+\n```"
