When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black must respond with Rxc8, after which White can continue with Nxc8, but then loses the knight.\n2. **e5f7** (Nf7): Forks queen and rook, but after Qxf7, White loses the knight.\n3. **e5g6** (Ng6): Attacks the rook on c8 and threatens Ne7+.\n4. **e3e1** (Re1): Doubles rooks on the e-file.\n5. **e3g3** (Rg3): Swings the rook to the kingside, threatening Qxf7+ ideas.\n6. **e3f3** (Rf3): Attacks the knight on f6.\n7. **b7a8** (Qa8): Retreats queen, not optimal.\n8. **e5d7** (Nd7): Attacks the queen and rook, but queen can move.\n\n**Tactical calculation:**\n- **b7c8** (Qxc8+): Rxc8, Nxc8, Rxc8. White loses the knight and queen for two rooks, not optimal.\n- **e5g6** (Ng6): If fxg6, Qxc8+ wins the rook. If not captured, threatens Ne7+.\n- **e5f7** (Nf7): Qxf7, White loses the knight.\n- **e3g3** (Rg3): Threatens Qxf7+ and Rxg6.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **e5g6** (Ng6) is very strong. If Black plays fxg6, then Qxc8+ wins the rook. If Black does not capture, White threatens Ne7+ and Qxc8.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5g6\n```"
