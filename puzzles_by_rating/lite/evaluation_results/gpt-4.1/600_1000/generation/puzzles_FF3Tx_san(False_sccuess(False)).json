When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's pawns are advanced on the queenside, especially b5 and c4. Black's knight on e4 is centralized and dangerous, but White has a bishop on e2 that can help control the board.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- b5b6: Advance the b-pawn, threatening bxa7 and possibly b7.\n- g4g5: Attack on the kingside, but Black's king is far away.\n- f4f5: Try to open lines on the kingside.\n- e2f3: Move the bishop to a more active square, possibly to support the queenside pawns.\n- b3a3: Move the king away from the queenside, but this seems unnecessary.\n- b3c2: Retreat the king, but it's already well placed.\n- h3h4: Advance the h-pawn, but not urgent.\n- e2d3: Bishop to d3, attacking e4 and supporting c4.\n\nLet's look at b5b6:\n- If b5b6, Black can play Kxb6, but then c4c5+ forks the king and knight.\n- If b5b6, and Black does not take, White threatens bxa7 and b7.\n\nLet's check the calculation:\n1. b5b6 Kxb6\n2. c4c5+ Kc7 (if Kc5, then bxa7)\n3. Bf3 (attacking e4) or Bf3 Nxc5+ (but then Kc3 and White is fine)\n\nAlternatively, after b5b6, if Black ignores and plays something like Nd6, then bxa7 and b7 is coming.\n\nb5b6 seems to be the most direct and strong move, pressing the queenside advantage and forcing Black to react.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb5b6\n```"
