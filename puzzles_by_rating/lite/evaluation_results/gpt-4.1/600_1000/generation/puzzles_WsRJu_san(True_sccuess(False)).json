When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is exposed, and White's queen is very active.\n\n**Threats:**\n- White threatens Qxf8 (winning the bishop with check).\n- Qg7-h8# is mate if Black's bishop leaves f8.\n- Black has no immediate threats; White's king is safe.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. Qxf8 (wins a piece with check, then can follow up with Qxd8, winning the rook)\n2. Qh8 (threatens mate, but doesn't win material immediately)\n3. Qg5/Qg4/Qg3 (not as forcing)\n4. e6 (opens lines, but not as direct)\n5. Rg1 (brings rook into play, but not as forcing as Qxf8)\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Qxf8+ Rxf8 (forced, otherwise Black loses the rook for nothing)\n- Qxf8+ is not possible, as the rook is on d8, not f8. So after Qxf8+, Black must move the king.\n- Qxf8+ Ka7 (only move)\n- Qxd8 (wins the rook, White is up a queen for a bishop)\n\n**Is there a mate?**\n- Qxf8+ Ka7 (only move)\n- Qxc5+ (picking up another pawn with check)\n- ...b6 (forced)\n- Qe7+ (threatening mate on b7)\n- ...Kb8\n- Qxd8+ (wins the rook)\n\nAlternatively, Qxf8+ wins material and leaves Black with no counterplay.\n\n**Conclusion:** Qxf8+ is the most forcing move, wins material, and keeps Black's king exposed.\n\nMy move:\n```\nQxf8+\n```"
