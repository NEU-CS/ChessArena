If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If Black responds with fxg5, White can play f5, and if Black does nothing, White can play f5 next, opening the kingside further.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5\n```"
