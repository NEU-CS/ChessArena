When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

After Kxb3, Black can play b5, but White's king is active.\n2. **g3g5**: Defends h5 and keeps pressure on the kingside.\n3. **b8g8**: Doubles rooks on the g-file, threatening g2.\n4. **e4e3**: Pushes the passed pawn, but White can play Nc6+ or b5.\n5. **f5f4**: Attacks the bishop, but White can play Bc2.\n6. **b6b5**: Tries to create a passed pawn, but White can play Nc3.\n\n**Deep analysis:**\n- **g3b3+**: After Kxb3, Black loses the rook for nothing.\n- **g3g5**: Defends h5, but is passive.\n- **b8g8**: Doubles rooks, threatens g2, and increases pressure.\n- **e4e3**: If White plays Nc6+, Ke6, then b5, but Black's e-pawn is dangerous.\n- **f5f4**: White can play Bc2, and Black doesn't gain much.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **b8g8** is very strong, doubling on the g-file and threatening Rg2, which could be decisive. White has no good way to defend g2, and the threat of Rg2 is very strong.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb8g8\n```"
