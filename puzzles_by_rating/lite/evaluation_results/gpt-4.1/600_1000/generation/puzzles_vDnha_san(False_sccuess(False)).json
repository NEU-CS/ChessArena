When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's rook is active, and White's pawns are advanced but not immediately queening.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- e3e2: Rook invades the second rank, threatening b2 and possibly supporting c2 in the future.\n- e3e4: Attacks f4 pawn, but White's king is far away.\n- e3e6: Defends c6, but not very active.\n- c6c5: Pushes the pawn, but White can blockade with the knight.\n- h4h3: Pushes the h-pawn, but White can stop it easily.\n- f7g8: King to safety, but not active.\n\nThe most active and dangerous move is:\n- e3e2: This attacks b2 and threatens to win a pawn, possibly giving Black counterplay.\n\nLet's check if White can defend b2 after e3e2:\n- If White plays Ka3, then Rxb2, and Black gets a pawn back.\n- If White plays Nc5, then Rxb2+, Ka3, Rb5, and Black can try to harass the king.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne3e2\n```"
