You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

If we can eliminate the knight, we might survive, but after Bxd6 or Rxd6, Qxe7+ wins the bishop.\n\n**Best defensive try:**\n- **Qb6**: Defends the bishop on e7 and attacks d6. If White exchanges queens, Black can recapture with the bishop and be up material.\n\nLet's check the line:\n1. ... Qb6\n   - If 2. Qxb6 Bxd6 (now the knight is gone, and Black is up a piece)\n   - If 2. Qxe7+ Kg8 (bishop is defended)\n   - If 2. Nf5 Nxf5\n\n**Conclusion:** Qb6 is the best move, defending the bishop and offering a queen trade.\n\n```\nQb6\n```"
