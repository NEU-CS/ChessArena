When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Rxg7+ \u2014 This is a forcing check. If ...Kxg7, then Qxd2, regaining material.\n2. Qxd2 \u2014 Exchange queens, but this is not urgent.\n3. Rc8 \u2014 Attacks the queen, but Black can respond with ...Bxg2+.\n4. Qg3 \u2014 Threatens mate on g7, but Black can defend with ...Qxf1+ and ...Bxg2+.\n5. f5 \u2014 Opens the f-file, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n6. c5 \u2014 Pushes the pawn, but not forcing.\n\nLet's calculate Rxg7+:\n\n1. Rxg7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n2. Qxd2 \u2014 White wins the queen for a rook and regains material, but let's check if there is anything better.\n\nAfter Rxg7+, if ...Kxg7, White can play Qxd2, and the material is:\n- White: Q, N, 6 pawns\n- Black: R, B, 6 pawns\n\nWhite is up a queen for a rook and bishop, which is a decisive advantage.\n\nIs there any better move? Let's check for mate threats:\n\n- Rxg7+ is the most forcing and wins material.\n- Qg3 does not threaten mate because Black can defend.\n- Rc8 is not as forcing.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRxg7+\n```"
