When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White exchanges, Black's king becomes less exposed, and the bishop can develop.\n- **c8d7**: This attacks the rook on b1, but after Rxb7, White wins a pawn and threatens to invade.\n- **g7g6**: This is a useful waiting move, but doesn't address the main issues.\n- **g4g3**: Aggressive, but White can respond with fxg3, opening the f-file for White's rook.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is **d8e8**, challenging the e-file and aiming to trade rooks, which would reduce White's attacking potential and possibly allow Black to activate the bishop.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nd8e8\n```"
