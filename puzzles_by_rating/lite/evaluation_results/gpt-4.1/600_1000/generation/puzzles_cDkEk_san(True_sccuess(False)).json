If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Bd3:**\n- White's knight is on e5, centralized and active.\n- White's queen is on d4, also centralized.\n- White's bishop is on d3, eyeing the kingside.\n- Black's king is on c1, so White is castled queenside.\n- Black's king is on g8, castled kingside.\n- Black's bishop is on a1, which is odd\u2014this means Black's dark-squared bishop captured something on a1.\n- Black's queen is on d8.\n- Black's knight is on b8.\n- Black's rook is on f8.\n- Black's pawns: a7, b7, c6, f7, g7, h7.\n- White's pawns: a2, c2, f2, g2, h2.\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- White threatens Qxh7# (mate) if the bishop on d3 moves with tempo.\n- White's pieces are very active and coordinated.\n- Black's bishop on a1 is not doing much.\n- Black's queen is on d8, can defend h4 if needed.\n- Black's knight is undeveloped.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- Defend against Qxh7# threat.\n- Consider Qg5 to exchange queens or defend h7.\n- Consider h6 to give the king luft and prevent Qxh7#.\n- Consider f5 to kick the knight, but that weakens e6.\n- Consider Nd7 to develop and defend e5.\n- Consider Qxd4, but then White recaptures with the bishop, keeping pressure.\n\n**Critical lines:**\n- If 12... Qg5, then 13. Bxg5, hxg5, and White is up material.\n- If 12... h6, then 13. Qe4 f5 14. Qc4+ Kh7 15. g4, White is still pressing.\n- If 12... f5, then 13. Qc4+ Kh8 14. Nf7+ Rxf7 15. Qxf7, White is winning.\n- If 12... Nd7, then 13. Nxd7 Qxd7 14. Qxd7 Bxd7, White is up a pawn.\n\n**Best defensive move:**\n- 12... Qg5 seems to be the best, offering a queen trade and defending h7. If White exchanges queens, Black can recapture with the bishop, and the immediate mate threat is gone.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQg5\n```"
