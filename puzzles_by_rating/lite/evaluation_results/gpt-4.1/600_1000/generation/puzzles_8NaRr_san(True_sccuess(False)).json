If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Let's calculate:\n    - Ne3 attacks the queen and rook.\n    - If Bxe3, Qxe3+ Kh1, Qxe4+ Bxe4, Black is up a pawn.\n    - If Qh7+, Kh8, Qe4, Nxf1, Qh7# is not possible, so Black wins the exchange.\n    - If Qf3, Nxf1, Rxf1, Qxg4, Black is up a pawn.\n\n- **Qxg4**: If Qxg4, Qxg4 hxg4, Bxf5 exf5 Rxf5, White regains the pawn and has pressure.\n\n- **Qe3+**: If Qxe3+, Qxe3 Nxe3, White's bishop is attacked, but after Rf3, Black's knight is awkward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**Ne3** is the strongest move, forking queen and rook, and after Bxe3 Qxe3+ Kh1 Qxe4+ Bxe4, Black is up a pawn with a good position.\n\nMy move:\n```\nNe3\n```"
