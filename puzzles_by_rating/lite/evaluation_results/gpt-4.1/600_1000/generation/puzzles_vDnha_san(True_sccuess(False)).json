Rxb3 2. Kxb3, White's king is now closer to the a-pawn and can support its promotion.\n- If 1... c5 2. a7, White is threatening to queen.\n- If 1... Re7 2. a7, White is still threatening to queen.\n\n**Best defensive try:**\n- 1... Re8, preparing to meet a7 with Ra8, stopping the pawn from queening. This is the most logical defense.\n\n**Let's check:**\n1... Re8 2. a7 Ra8, and now White cannot queen immediately.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRe8\n```"
