When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is stuck on the queenside, and White's rooks are extremely active. The f7 rook is on the 7th rank, and the e4 rook is ready to swing.\n\nTactical ideas:\n- Rook f7-f8 is a direct check, but after Kd7, White needs to continue.\n- Rook e4-e8 is a powerful check, and if ...Rd8, then Rxd8+ Kxd8, Rf8# is mate.\n- Rook e4-e8 forces Black to block with the rook, after which White can exchange and deliver mate.\n\nLet's check the move e4e8:\n\n1. e4e8 Rd8 (forced)\n2. Rxd8+ Kxd8\n3. Rf8# (checkmate)\n\nThis is a forced mate in three.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne4e8\n```"
