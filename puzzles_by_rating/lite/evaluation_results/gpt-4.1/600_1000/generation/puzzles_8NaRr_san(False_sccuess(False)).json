When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

So this is not possible.\n3. **g5g4** (Queen to g4): Attacks the bishop on d3 and keeps pressure on g2, but White can play Qxg4 or Qe2.\n4. **g5g6** (Queen to g6): Passive, doesn't do much.\n5. **g5h4** (Queen to h4): Threatens mate on h2, but White can defend with Qg2 or Qe2.\n6. **f5h4** (Knight to h4): Attacks g2, but White can play Qh7# (again, mate!).\n7. **g7g6** (pawn to g6): Defends the knight, but weakens dark squares.\n8. **e6e5** (pawn to e5): Attacks the queen, but White can play Qxe5.\n9. **a8d8** (rook to d8): Centralizes the rook, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n10. **g5e7** (Queen to e7): Retreat, not active.\n\n**Tactical alert:** White is threatening Qh7#, which is checkmate! So Black must address this threat immediately.\n\n**Defensive moves:**\n- **g8h8** (King to h8): Moves the king away, but Qh7# is still mate.\n- **g8h7** (King to h7): Qh7# is mate.\n- **f8e7** (Bishop to e7): Not possible, bishop is on f8.\n- **g7g6** (pawn to g6): This is the only move that stops Qh7#.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only move to avoid immediate mate is **g7g6**.\n\n```\ng7g6\n```"
