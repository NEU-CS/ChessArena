When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a bishop (b4), knight (e2), two pawns (g3, h4), and a king (e3).\n- White's bishop on b4 is well-placed, controlling the long diagonal and helping to restrain the b-pawn.\n- White's knight on e2 is centralized and can jump to good squares.\n- White's king is active on e3.\n- Black's rook on g2 is aggressive, eyeing g3 and e2.\n- Black's king is on f7, somewhat central.\n- Black's pawns: b6 and h7. The b-pawn is blockaded by the bishop, but the h-pawn can advance.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **g2g3** (Rook takes pawn): This grabs a pawn, but after Nxg3, the rook is exchanged for a knight, which is bad for Black.\n2. **g2h2** (Rook to h2): Attacks the h4 pawn, but White can defend with Nf4 or Be1.\n3. **g2f2** (Rook to f2): Attacks the knight, but the knight is defended by the king.\n4. **g2e2** (Rook to e2): Attacks the knight, but the knight is defended by the king.\n5. **g2g1** (Rook to g1): Not threatening much.\n6. **h7h6** (Pawn move): Prepares h5-h4, but slow.\n7. **g6g5** (Pawn move): Not possible, as there is no pawn on g6.\n8. **b6b5** (Pawn move): Tries to activate the b-pawn, but White can play Nc3 or a4 to blockade.\n9. **h7h5** (Pawn move): Starts pushing the h-pawn, could be useful.\n\n**Tactical checks:**\n- Rook captures on g3 loses the exchange (rook for knight).\n- Rook to h2 attacks h4, but White can defend.\n- Rook to e2 or f2 attacks the knight, but it's defended.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Black is down a piece for two pawns, but has an active rook and some pawn chances.\n- The best chance is to activate the rook and try to create counterplay against White's pawns, especially h4.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **g2h2**: This attacks the h4 pawn directly, and if White defends with Nf4, then h7-h6 can follow, and the rook stays active. This is the most aggressive and active move, keeping pressure and maximizing counterplay.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng2h2\n```"
