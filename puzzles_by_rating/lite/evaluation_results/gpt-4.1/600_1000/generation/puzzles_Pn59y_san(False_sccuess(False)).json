When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black plays fxg6, then Qxg6 is mate.\n- **g4h5**: Threatens mate on h7, but Black can play h6.\n- **g4g6**: Threatens Qxg7#, but g7 is protected.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **e7g6**: If Knight goes to g6, Black cannot take with f7 pawn (it's on f7), so only h7 pawn can take, but it's blocked. So after Ng6, the threat is Qh5+ and Nxf8.\n- After **e7g6**, if Black plays fxg6, then Qxg6 is mate (since the f8 Rook is pinned and the King can't escape).\n- If Black does nothing, Nxf8 wins the Rook.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **e7g6** is a crushing move, threatening mate and winning material.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n```\ne7g6\n```"
