Bb7, White can play Nxb8 Rxb8 Bxb5+ Nd7, and Black is OK.\n- If 11... Be7, White can play Nxe7 Qxe7 Bxb5+ Bd7 Bxd7+ Qxd7, and Black is OK.\n- If 11... a6, White can play Nxb8 Rxb8 Bxb5+ axb5, and White wins a pawn.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Be7** is solid, develops, and prepares to castle, keeping the material balance and not allowing White to win a pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBe7\n```"
