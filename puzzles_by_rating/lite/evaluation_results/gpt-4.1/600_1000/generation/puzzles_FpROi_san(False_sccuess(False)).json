When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a rook (g6), knight (c2), pawns (b5, a4), and king (d3).\n- White's rook on g6 is active, and White's king is centralized.\n- Black's rook on f2 is very active, and Black's bishop on b6 is well placed.\n- Black's pawns are advanced and could become dangerous.\n- White's knight is on c2, not very active.\n- Black's king is relatively safe on c6.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **f2f3+**: Check to the White king. White must respond.\n2. **b6c7**: Retreats the bishop, but doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n3. **e5e4+**: Pawn check, but White can play Kd2 or Ke2.\n4. **d5d4**: Advances the pawn, but doesn't threaten immediately.\n5. **f2f4**: Attacks the knight, but not forcing.\n6. **f2f1**: Rook to first rank, but not threatening.\n\n**Let's analyze f2f3+:**\n- f2f3+ forces White's king to move. Let's see the options:\n    - Kd2: Then Black can play d5-d4, pushing the pawn and keeping the initiative.\n    - Ke2: Then Black can play Rf2xc2, winning the knight.\n    - Kd4: Not possible, as the square is protected by the bishop.\n\nIf White plays Kd2, Black can continue with d5-d4, and the pawns become very dangerous. If White plays Ke2, Black wins the knight with Rxc2.\n\n**Therefore, f2f3+ is a forcing move that either wins material or gives Black a strong initiative.**\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf2f3\n```"
