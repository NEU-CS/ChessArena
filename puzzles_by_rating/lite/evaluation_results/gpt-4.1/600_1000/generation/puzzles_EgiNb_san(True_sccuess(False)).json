If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Legal moves:** Kg2, Kh1, Kf1\n\n**Material:**\n- White: King (g1), Queen (c2), Rooks (b6, d6), pawns (c5, f2, g3, h2)\n- Black: King (g8), Queen (f5), Rook (c8), pawns (d5, e5, f3, g6, h7)\n\n**Position:**\n- White's king is on g1, and is in a bit of danger due to Black's queen and rook activity.\n- Black's queen and rook are active, and Black has a dangerous pawn on f3.\n- White's queen and rooks are active, but the king is exposed.\n\n**Legal moves:** Only king moves: Kg2, Kh1, Kf1\n\nLet's analyze each:\n\n### 1. Kg2\n- Moves the king to g2, closer to the center and the action.\n- Is this square safe? Let's check for checks:\n    - Black can play Ne1+ (after f3-f2), but currently the knight is on f3 and can't check immediately.\n    - Black's queen can't check from f5.\n    - Black's rook can't check from c8.\n    - So, Kg2 is not immediately losing.\n\n### 2. Kh1\n- Moves the king to the corner.\n- Is this square safe? Let's check for checks:\n    - Black's queen can't check from f5.\n    - Black's rook can't check from c8.\n    - Black's knight can't check from f3.\n    - So, Kh1 is safe for now.\n\n### 3. Kf1\n- Moves the king to f1.\n- Is this square safe? Let's check for checks:\n    - Black's queen can't check from f5.\n    - Black's rook can't check from c8.\n    - Black's knight can't check from f3.\n    - So, Kf1 is safe for now.\n\n**Which is best?**\n\n- Kg2 brings the king closer to the center, but also closer to Black's queen and knight.\n- Kh1 tucks the king away in the corner, but could be vulnerable to back rank threats if the rooks leave.\n- Kf1 keeps the king on the back rank, but could be vulnerable if Black's queen or rook invades.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- Black's main threat is the passed f3 pawn and the active queen/rook.\n- White's queen and rooks are active, but the king is exposed.\n- If White plays Kg2, the king is more active and can help defend against the f3 pawn.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\n- White needs to avoid back rank mates and coordinate the queen and rooks to counter Black's threats.\n- The king is safest on h1 for now, as it avoids any checks and keeps the back rank covered by the queen and rooks.\n\n**Final decision:**\n- Kh1 is the safest move, as it avoids any immediate threats and keeps the king tucked away.\n\n```\nKh1\n```"
