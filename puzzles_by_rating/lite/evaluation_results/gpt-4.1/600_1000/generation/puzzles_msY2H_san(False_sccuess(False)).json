When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position:\n\n**Material:**\n- Both sides have all major pieces, but White is slightly better developed.\n- Black's bishop pair is active, especially the dark-squared bishop on g4.\n- White's king is relatively safe, but Black's king is also not under immediate threat.\n\n**Positional factors:**\n- Black's c5/d5 pawns control the center, but White has a pawn majority on the kingside.\n- White's queen is centralized on e2, and the knight on f3 is well-placed.\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning the knight on f3, which is a key tactical motif.\n- The c7 queen has many options, including potential threats along the c-file and diagonals.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **c7f4**: Queen to f4 attacks the knight on f3 and threatens to invade the kingside. However, White can play g3, kicking the queen.\n2. **g4h5**: Bishop to h5 keeps the pin and eyes the f3 knight, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n3. **f6e7**: Retreating the bishop to e7, but this is passive.\n4. **d5d4**: Advancing the d-pawn attacks the knight on f3 and opens the center, but White can respond with cxd4.\n5. **g7g6**: Prepares to fianchetto the bishop, but is slow.\n6. **f8e8**: Centralizes the rook, but not urgent.\n7. **c7d7**: Queen to d7, connecting rooks and defending the bishop.\n8. **f6g5**: Bishop to g5, but White can play g4.\n\n**Tactical ideas:**\n- The pin on the f3 knight is important. If the knight moves, the queen on e2 is exposed.\n- The move **c7f4** is interesting, as it attacks the knight and threatens to double White's pawns if the knight moves.\n\n**Calculation for c7f4:**\n- 16... Qf4\n  - 17. hxg4 Bxg4, White's king is exposed.\n  - 17. g3 Qxf3, White loses the queen.\n  - 17. Qe3 Qxe3, fxe3 Bxf3, White's pawn structure is ruined.\n\n**Calculation for d5d4:**\n- 16... d4\n  - 17. hxg4 dxc3, Black wins a pawn.\n  - 17. cxd4 Bxf3, White's queen is attacked.\n\n**Best move:**\nAfter careful analysis, **c7f4** is the most aggressive and creates immediate threats, leveraging the pin and threatening to win material.\n\nMy move:\n```\nc7f4\n```"
