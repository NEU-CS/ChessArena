When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

White's king is active and can help mop up the remaining pawns.\n- There is no immediate counterplay for Black.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to capture the knight and go up a piece.\n\n```\nBxe7\n```"
