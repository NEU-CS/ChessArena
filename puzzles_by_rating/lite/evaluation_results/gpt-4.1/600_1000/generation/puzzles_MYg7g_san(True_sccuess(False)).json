When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If Kb8, then White can continue to press.\n2. **Qf6**: Threatens Qxg7, but Black can play Qxf6.\n3. **Bxa6**: Captures a pawn, but may not be as forcing.\n4. **Bb5**: Pins the knight, but not as direct.\n5. **Qxe5**: Captures the knight, but Black can recapture with bishop.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- After **Qe3+**, if Kb8, White can play Nf4 (threatening Nxe6 or Nxe6+), or continue to build pressure.\n- After **Qe3+ Kb8**, White can play Nf4, threatening Nxe6, and Black's king remains exposed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **Qe3+** is the most forcing, keeps the initiative, and puts Black's king in a precarious position.\n\nMy move:\n```\nQe3+\n```"
