When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qb4-h4 g6 (forced)\n- 2. Qxg5 Qxg5\n- 3. hxg5 and White is up a pawn, but the attack is gone.\n\n**What about Qb4-g4?**\n- Attacks the queen, but Black can play ...Qxg4.\n\n**What about Qb4-f4?**\n- Attacks the queen, but Black can play ...Qxf4.\n\n**What about Qb4-c5?**\n- Attacks the queen, but Black can play ...Qxc5.\n\n**What about Qb4-d2?**\n- Doubles on the d-file, but not threatening.\n\n**What about Qb4-b7?**\n- 1. Qb4-b7 Rxb7\n- 2. Bxb7 and White has a strong bishop on b7, attacking the rook on e8.\n\n**What about Bf3-b7?**\n- Attacks the rook on e7, but Black can play ...Rxb7.\n\n**What about Qb4-b6?**\n- Attacks the rook on e6, but Black can play ...axb6.\n\n**What about Qb4-d4?**\n- Attacks the queen, but Black can play ...Qxd4.\n\n**What about Qb4-h4?**\n- Threatens mate on h7.\n\nAfter all analysis, the move **Qb4-h4** seems the most promising, as it threatens mate and forces Black to weaken their kingside with ...g6.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb4h4\n```"
