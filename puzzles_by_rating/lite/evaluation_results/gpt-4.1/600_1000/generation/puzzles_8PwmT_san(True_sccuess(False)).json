If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Rxf7 Rxf7 (if ...Kxf7, then Qf3+ wins the bishop on g7)\n- 25. Qg4 (threatening Qc8+ and Qe6)\n- If Black plays ...c4+, White can play Bf1 or Kh1.\n\nAlternatively, after Rxf7, if Black plays ...Qxa2, White can continue with Rxc7, threatening mate on g7.\n\n**Tactical check:**\n- Rxf7 seems safe: if ...Rxf7, then Rxf7, and White is up a pawn and has pressure.\n- If ...Kxf7, then Qf3+ wins the bishop.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is:\n```\nRxf7\n```"
