When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Rxb8+ Kf7 3. Be8+ wins the rook on b8.\n- If 1... b1b6, 2. Bxb6 a8a2 3. Rb8+ Kf7 4. Be8+ Kf6 5. Bd4# is mate.\n- If 1... a8c8, 2. Rc7 wins the rook on c8.\n- If 1... f8g8, White can play Rb8+ and win the rook.\n- If 1... e7e6, White can play dxe6, and the position collapses.\n\n**Best try:**\n- The only move that avoids immediate loss of the rook is a8a2, but that's not legal.\n- The move a8e8 at least keeps the rook on the back rank and avoids immediate loss, but White can still play Rb8 and win the exchange.\n\nHowever, the move that gives Black the best chance to continue is to play:\n```\na8c8\n```\nThis at least keeps the rook on the back rank and tries to defend, though Black is still in a losing position."
