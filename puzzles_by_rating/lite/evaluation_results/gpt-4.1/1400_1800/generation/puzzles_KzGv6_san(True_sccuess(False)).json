White must respond, and after cxd4, Black can play Qxd4, but then White can play Be3, attacking the queen and defending.\n2. **Qh4**: Threatens Qg3, but White can defend easily.\n3. **Bxf4**: Captures a pawn, but exposes the queen to attack.\n4. **Nb6**: Retreats the knight, but loses central control.\n5. **Rcb8**: Doubles rooks on the b-file, but not immediately threatening.\n6. **Re8**: Centralizes the rook, but not an immediate threat.\n7. **Kh8**: Improves king safety, but passive.\n8. **Qe7**: Retreats the queen, but loses activity.\n9. **g6**: Kicks the queen, but weakens the kingside.\n\n**Deep Calculation:**\n- **Qxd4+**: If cxd4, then Qxd4+, White can block with Be3, and after Nxe3, Bxe3, Black has won a pawn and has a strong position.\n- **Qxd4+**: If cxd4, Qxd4+, Be3, Nxe3, Bxe3, Black is up a pawn and has a strong bishop pair.\n\n**Tactical Considerations:**\n- Qxd4+ wins a pawn and forces White to respond. It also keeps the initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQxd4+\n```"
