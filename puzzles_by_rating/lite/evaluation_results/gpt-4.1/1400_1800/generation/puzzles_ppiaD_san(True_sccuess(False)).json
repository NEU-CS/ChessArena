If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After ...Kf7, Nxf5 wins a pawn and attacks the bishop on f5.\n2. **Nb4**: Attacks the pinned knight on d6 again, but doesn't seem to do much immediately.\n3. **e4**: Opens the center, but may weaken d4.\n4. **Qb2**: Centralizes the queen, but not urgent.\n5. **Rc5**: Attacks the queen on b6, but the queen can move.\n\n**Deep calculation for Ne7+:**\n- 26. Ne7+ Kf7 (if Kh8, then Nxf5 wins a pawn)\n- 27. Nxf5 Nxf5 (if exf5, then Qxa5)\n- 28. Qxa5 Rxc1+ 29. Bf1\n\nThis sequence wins a pawn and keeps the initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nNe7+\n```"
