You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

If White plays Nxh4, then Qxh4 is possible, but White can defend with h3.\n2. **Nxe3**: Captures a pawn, attacks the queen and bishop. If White plays Qxe3, then Bxf5, and Black regains the piece.\n3. **Qf6**: Defends the knight, attacks f5, and keeps an eye on b2.\n4. **Nf6**: Retreats the knight, but loses pressure.\n5. **Bxf5**: Captures the knight, but after Nxf5, White's queen is still active.\n6. **Qb6**: Attacks e3 and b2, but White can defend.\n7. **Rg8**: Prepares to castle by hand, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\n**Deep calculation:**\n\nLet's look at **Nxe3**:\n- 14...Nxe3 15. Nxe3 Bc6 (attacks queen, develops bishop)\n- If 16. Qe5+ Qe7 17. Qxe7+ Bxe7, Black is fine.\n- If 16. Qc3 d4, Black gains space.\n\nBut after 14...Nxe3 15. Nxe3 Bc6 16. Qe5+ Qe7 17. Nxe7 Bxe7, White is up a piece.\n\nAlternatively, **Qh4**:\n- 14...Qh4 threatens mate on h2.\n- If 15. Nxh4, then Qxh2# is not possible (pawn on g2).\n- If 15. h3, then Nf6, and Black can regroup.\n\nAlternatively, **Qf6**:\n- 14...Qf6 attacks f5 and supports the knight.\n- If 15. Qxf6 Nxf6, Black is fine.\n\nAlternatively, **Qb6**:\n- 14...Qb6 attacks e3 and b2.\n- If 15. Qxb6 axb6, Black has the bishop pair.\n\nAlternatively, **Qxg5**:\n- 14...Qxg5, but White can play Qxd5.\n\n**Best move:**\nAfter careful analysis, **Qf6** is the best move. It defends the knight, attacks f5, and keeps the queen active. It also prevents White from easily capturing on d5.\n\n```\nQf6\n```"
