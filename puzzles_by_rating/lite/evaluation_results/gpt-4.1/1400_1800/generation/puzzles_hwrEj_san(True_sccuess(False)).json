White's last move was likely Qxd2, capturing something on d2.\n\n**Threats:**\n- White threatens nothing immediate, but Black has a strong attack.\n- Black can consider Qxg2+ (forcing Kg1), then Qxe4 (winning the bishop), but after Qxg2+ Kg1 Qxe4, White has Qxh6+ Kg8 Qg7# (mate!). So that doesn't work.\n\n- Rxg3 is tempting, but after Rxg3 hxg3 Qxg3, White's king is still exposed, but Black is down a rook for a pawn.\n\n- Qd4+ is a check. If Kh1, then Qxe4 wins the bishop. If Rf2, then Qxe4 wins the bishop.\n\n- Qe3+ is also a check. If Kh1, then Qxe4. If Rf2, then Qxe4.\n\n- Qxg2+ forces Kg1, but then what? Qxe4 runs into Qxh6+.\n\n- Qe1 is not a check, and doesn't threaten much.\n\n- Rxe4 is possible, but after Qxh6+ Kg8 Qg7# is mate.\n\n- Rgf8 brings another rook into play.\n\n**Let's calculate Qd4+:**\n1. ... Qd4+\n   - Kh1 Qxe4 (wins the bishop)\n   - Rf2 Qxe4 (wins the bishop)\n   - Qe3 Qxe4 (wins the bishop)\n\nSo Qd4+ seems to win the bishop on e4.\n\n**Let's check for tactics:**\nIs there any way for White to counterattack after Qd4+? Not really, since the bishop is hanging.\n\n**Alternative:**\n- Qe3+ is similar, but Qd4+ is more forcing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is:\n```\nQd4+\n```"
