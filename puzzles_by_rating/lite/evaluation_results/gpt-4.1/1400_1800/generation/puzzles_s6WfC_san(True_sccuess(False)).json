When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's rook on e3 is menacing, and Black's pawns are advanced. White must play actively.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- **g3+**: Immediate check. If ...Kxg3, then Rxe3+ wins the rook. If ...Kf5, White can continue with Be4# (but check if that's mate).\n- **Re8**: Pins the f8 pawn, but not immediately threatening.\n- **Bg8**: Not threatening.\n- **e5**: Pawn push, but Black's king is too active.\n- **h4**: Not urgent.\n\n**Let's calculate g3+:**\n1. g3+ Kxg3 (forced, otherwise loses rook)\n2. Rxe3+ dxe3 (forced)\n3. Bf3 (threatening mate on g2, but Black can play Kf4 and White is down material)\n\nBut after 1. g3+, if ...Kf5:\n2. Be4# is checkmate.\n\nSo, **g3+** is a forcing move. If Black takes with the king, White wins the rook. If Black moves to f5, it's mate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng3+\n```"
