If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

This is a forced move to avoid immediate mate, as otherwise Qd5# is unstoppable. After Qxe7, White will recapture with Nxe7+, and Black's king is still in danger, but at least the immediate mate threat is gone.\n\n2. **King moves (Kd7, Kc7, Kb7, Kd6, Kb6, Kb5):**\n   - All king moves allow Qd5# (mate), since the queen on f7 covers the fifth rank and the d5 square is open.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe only move to avoid immediate mate is **Qxe7**.\n\n```\nQxe7\n```"
