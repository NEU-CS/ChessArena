Kxg6: Captures a pawn, but allows Black to push f4.\n2. Kh6: Moves the king away from the center, not optimal.\n3. Kf6: Centralizes the king, but doesn't threaten anything immediately.\n4. f3, g3, f4, g4: Pawn moves, but they don't seem to create immediate threats.\n\nLet's calculate Kxg6:\n- 1. Kxg6 f4 (Black tries to create counterplay)\n- 2. Kxg6-f5 (attacking e4)\n- If Black plays e3, White can play fxe3 and the king is very active.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Kxg6, if Black plays e3, White can play fxe3 and White's king is still very active.\n\nKxg6 seems to win a pawn and keep the king active.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to capture the pawn on g6.\n\n```\nKxg6\n```"

Kxh5 e3 (Black tries to push)\n2. fxe3 fxe3\n3. fxe3 fxe3\n4. Kg5 (or Kg6) \u2014 White's king is close enough to stop the pawns and can support the advance of White's own pawns.\n\nAlternatively, after Kxh5, if Black tries Kd6, White can play Kg5 and start pushing the pawns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nKxh5 is the best move, grabbing a pawn and keeping the king active.\n\n```\nKxh5\n```"
