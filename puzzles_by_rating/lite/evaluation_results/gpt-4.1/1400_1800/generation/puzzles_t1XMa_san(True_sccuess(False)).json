If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Rxd4+ cxd4 (forced)\n2. Qxd5+ (now the king is forced to b3 or b4)\n   - If Kb3, then Qb5+ picks up the knight or continues the attack.\n   - If Kb4, then Qb5+ is again strong.\n\nThis sequence looks crushing for Black, as White's king is completely exposed and Black's queen dominates.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nRxd4+\n```"
