If White recaptures with Rxe3, then Black can play Rxe3, and after Nxe3, Black is up material. If White moves the king, Black can continue the attack.\n2. **Re8**: Defends the back rank, but doesn't address the threat on g7.\n3. **Rg6**: Defends g7, but White can play Ne7+ or Qb8+.\n4. **Qxf5**: Captures the knight, but White can play Qb8+ and then Qxe8+.\n5. **Kh8**: Moves the king, but doesn't address the threat on g7.\n\n**Calculation of Qxe3+:**\n- 33...Qxe3+ 34. Rxe3 Rxe3\n  - If 35. Qxg7# is not possible because the rook is on e3.\n  - If 35. Nxe3, Black is up material.\n\nBut after 33...Qxe3+ 34. Rxe3 Rxe3, White can play Qxg7# because the rook is not on the e-file anymore. So, Qxe3+ loses to Qxg7#.\n\n**Calculation of Rg6:**\n- 33...Rg6 34. Qb8+ Qd8 35.
