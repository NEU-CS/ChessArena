When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is somewhat boxed in, but White's king is exposed on h4.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- Rxf7: Captures the dangerous f7 pawn, but allows White to double rooks on the 8th rank.\n- Rg8: Defends the 8th rank, but White can double rooks.\n- Rf4+: Gives check, forcing White's king to g5 or h5.\n- Rh6+: Gives check, king can go to g5 or h5.\n- h6: Gives luft, but doesn't address White's threats.\n- g5+: Check, king must go to h5.\n\n**Tactical ideas:**\n- Rf4+ or Rh6+ could expose White's king further.\n- Rxf7 removes a dangerous pawn, but White's rooks are very active.\n\nLet's calculate Rf4+:\n1. ... Rf4+ 2. Rxf4 Rxf4+ 3. Kg5 (or Kh5)\n- If 3. ... Rxf7, White can play Re7, threatening mate on f8.\n- If 3. ... h6+, White's king is forced to h5, but Black has no immediate follow-up.\n\nWhat about g5+?\n1. ... g5+ 2. Kxg5 (or Kh5)\n- If 2. ... Rxf7, White can play Re7, threatening mate.\n\nWhat about Rxf7?\n1. ... Rxf7 2. Rxf8+ Rxf8 3. Rxf8#\n\nSo Rxf7 loses immediately.\n\nWhat about Rg8?\n1. ... Rg8 2. Rxf8 Rxf8 3. Rxf8#\n\nSo Rg8 also loses.\n\nWhat about Rh6+?\n1. ... Rh6+ 2. Kg5 (or Kh5)\n- If 2. ... Rxf7, White can play Re7, threatening mate.\n\nWhat about h6?\n1. ... h6 2. Rxf8+ Rxf8 3. Rxf8#\n\nSo h6 loses.\n\nWhat about g5+?\n1. ... g5+ 2. Kxg5 (or Kh5)\n- If 2. ... Rxf7, White can play Re7, threatening mate.\n\nWhat about Rf5?\n1. ... Rf5 2. Rxf5 Rxf5 3. Re7\n\nNo good.\n\nWhat about Rf3?\n1. ... Rf3 2. Rxf8+ Rxf8 3. Rxf8#\n\nNo good.\n\nWhat about Rf4+?\n1. ... Rf4+ 2. Rxf4 Rxf4+ 3. Kg5 (or Kh5)\n- No immediate mate, but White is still threatening mate.\n\nIt seems that Black is in a losing position, as all options lead to mate or loss of material.\n\nThe only move that doesn't lose immediately is:\n```\ng5+\n```\nThis at least forces the White king to move and avoids immediate mate, buying a tempo."
