The knight on c6 is active.\n- Candidate moves:\n    - **Qxc7**: Captures the knight on c7, regaining material equality and removing a dangerous piece.\n    - **Qd7**: Defends the knight on c6 and keeps an eye on the h3 square.\n    - **Qf6**: Attacks the queen on h5, but White can exchange queens, which may relieve pressure.\n    - **Nd4**: Brings the knight to a central square, attacking the queen and threatening forks.\n    - **g6**: Attacks the queen, but weakens the dark squares around the king.\n    - **Be5**: Attacks the queen, but White can play Qf3 or Qg4.\n\nLet's look at **Qxc7**:\n- If Qxc7, Black wins back the piece and threatens to consolidate.\n- White can try Re8+ (forcing Kf7 or Qxe8), but after Kf7, White has no immediate threats.\n- If Qe8+ Qxe8 Rxe8+ Kf7, White has no more checks.\n\nOther moves like **Nd4** (attacking the queen) are interesting, but after Qd1 or Qg4, White keeps the initiative.\n\n**Qxc7** seems the most solid, regaining material and neutralizing White's initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxc7\n```"
