If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

It keeps the queen active, eyes both flanks, and maintains pressure without giving White any counterplay.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nQe5\n```"
