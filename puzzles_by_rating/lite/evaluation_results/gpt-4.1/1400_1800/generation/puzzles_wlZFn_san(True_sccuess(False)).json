White is better.\n- **b5**: Na5, Qb6, Nxb6, Nxb6, Bxb2, Rc2, Bf6. White is better.\n- **Rd7**: Defends b7, prepares to double on d-file, and supports b6.\n- **Qc7**: Defends b6, but White can play Qd4, targeting g7 and b6.\n- **Rd6**: Defends b6, but White can play Nxd6, Bxd6, Qd4, f6, Rfd1, Rfd8, Qg4.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Rd7** is solid: it defends b7, prepares to double rooks on the d-file, and supports b6. It also keeps options open for the queen and bishop.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRd7\n```"
