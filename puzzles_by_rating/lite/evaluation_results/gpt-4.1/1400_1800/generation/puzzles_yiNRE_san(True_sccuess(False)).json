If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

If Qxc5, White can play N2f3 again.\n\n**Best move:**\nAfter careful analysis, the move Qxd4 wins a piece, as White cannot recapture with the queen due to the rook on a4. After Qxd4, if N2f3, Black can play Qe4, keeping the extra piece.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxd4\n```"
