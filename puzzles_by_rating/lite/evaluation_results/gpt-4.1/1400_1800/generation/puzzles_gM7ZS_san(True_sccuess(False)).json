When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Legal moves:** Kf8, Ke8, Kf6, Rd7\n\nLet's look at the position:\n\n- White's queen is on c7, king on h6, pawns on f3, f2.\n- Black's king is on e7, pawns on b3, e6, h5, h7, rooks on d3, d5.\n- White is threatening Qe7# (mate) if the king moves off e7.\n- Black's king is in a precarious position, and White's queen is very active.\n\nLet's analyze each move:\n\n1. **Kf8**: This move puts the king on f8, but White can play Qg7# (mate).\n2. **Ke8**: This move keeps the king on the back rank, but White can play Qe7# (mate).\n3. **Kf6**: This move puts the king on f6, but White can play Qg7# (mate).\n4. **Rd7**: This move blocks the queen's access to e7, preventing immediate mate.\n\n**Rd7** is the only move that avoids immediate checkmate.\n\nLet's double-check:\n\n- After **Rd7**, if White captures the rook with Qxd7+, Black can play Kxd7, and the king escapes mate for now.\n- If White tries Qc5+, Black can block with Rd6 or move the king.\n\nTherefore, the only move to avoid immediate mate is:\n\n```\nRd7\n```"
