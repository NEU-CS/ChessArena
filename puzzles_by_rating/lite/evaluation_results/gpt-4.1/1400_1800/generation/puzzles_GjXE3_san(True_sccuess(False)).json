When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White's king is active, Black's king is stuck in the corner.\n\nThreats:  \n- White can play Rxh6+, which forces ...gxh6, and then White can push e6, opening the center and threatening to queen.\n- White's bishop is very strong, controlling key diagonals.\n- Black's knight on g2 is awkward, but it does defend h4 and f4.\n- Black's rook on a2 is far from the action.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Rxh6+ (forcing ...gxh6, then e6, opening the position)\n2. f6 (threatening mate on h7, but Black can defend)\n3. e6 (immediate pawn push, but Rxh6+ is more forcing)\n4. Ba8 (threatening to win the rook, but Black can play ...Ne3)\n5. Kd4 (centralizing king, but not urgent)\n\nLet's calculate Rxh6+:\n1. Rxh6+ gxh6 (forced)\n2. e6! (threatening exf7 and e7, opening the center)\n   - If ...fxe6, fxe6 wins.\n   - If ...Ne3, White can play e7, threatening mate and queening.\n   - Black's king is very exposed.\n\nThis looks very strong for White, and Black's king is in a mating net.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxh6+\n```"
