It attacks the g6 pawn, threatens to exchange bishops (reducing Black's attacking potential), and does not weaken White's position. If Black plays Be3+, White can simply capture with the queen, and after Qxe3+ Rxe3, White is safe. If Black exchanges bishops on h5, White can recapture with the queen or pawn, depending on the situation.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBh5\n```"
