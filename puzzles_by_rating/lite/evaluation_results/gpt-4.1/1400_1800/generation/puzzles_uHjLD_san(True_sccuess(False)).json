If Black plays Nxd4, White can recapture with the bishop or queen.\n2. **Qxc6**: Captures the knight, but after Qxc6, Black can play Qf3+ and try to create threats.\n3. **Qxd5**: Captures a pawn, but the queen is exposed in the center.\n4. **Ne6**: Attacks the queen and rook, but after Qxe6, White loses a piece.\n5. **Nxc6**: Captures the knight, but after bxc6, White's queen is still on b5.\n6. **Nf5**: Attacks the queen, but the queen can move.\n7. **Bc3**: Develops, but doesn't address the tactical possibilities.\n\n**Tactical calculation:**\n\n- **Qxb7**: If Qxb7, Black's best is Nxd4 (attacking the bishop and threatening Nf3+). After exd4, Qf3+ is possible, but White can play Kg1 and is safe. If Qxb7, White threatens Qxa8, winning the exchange.\n\n- **Qxc6**: If Qxc6, bxc6, White has won a piece, but the queen is now less active.\n\n- **Qxd5**: If Qxd5, Nxd4, exd4, Qf3+ is possible, but White can play Kg1.\n\n- **Nxc6**: If Nxc6, bxc6, White's queen is still on b5.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Qxb7** wins a pawn and threatens Qxa8, winning the exchange. Black's best reply is Nxd4, but after exd4, White is up material and has no immediate threats to worry about.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nQxb7\n```"
