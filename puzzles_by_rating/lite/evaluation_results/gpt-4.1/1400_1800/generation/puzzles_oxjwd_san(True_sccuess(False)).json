When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Bd5 attacks both the knight and b7 pawn.\n   - If Black plays Nf3+ (fork), White plays Bxf3, Rxb2, and White is still up the exchange, but Black gets the a2 pawn.\n   - If Black plays Ne2+, White plays Kf1, and the knight is still attacked.\n   - If Black plays Rc7, White can take b7: Bxb7, Kxb7, and White is up a piece.\n\nBd5 seems to be the most active move, attacking two targets and keeping the initiative.\n\nTherefore, my move is:\n```\nBd5\n```"
