If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If Black plays Qxg7, White can play Bxe8, winning the exchange.\n2. **Nxh6**: Captures a pawn with check, but after Bxh6, White loses the knight.\n3. **Nxd6**: Captures a pawn, but the knight is then hanging to Qxd6.\n4. **Ne7**: Forks the queen and rook, but the knight can be captured by Rxe7.\n5. **fxg5**: Opens the f-file, but doesn't seem to lead to anything immediate.\n6. **Qe3/Qg4**: Centralizes the queen, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n**Deep Calculation of Nxg7:**\n- 1. Nxg7 Qxg7 (forced, otherwise White wins the exchange)\n- 2. Bxe8 Rxe8\n- White has won the exchange (rook for bishop), and Black's kingside is weakened.\n\n**Alternative:**\n- 1. Nxh6 Bxh6 (loses a piece)\n- 1. Ne7 Rxe7 (loses a piece)\n- 1. Nxd6 Qxd6 (loses a piece)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Nxg7** is the strongest move, winning material and weakening Black's kingside.\n\nMy move:\n```\nNxg7\n```"
