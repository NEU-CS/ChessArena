Qxa8 \u2014 wins a rook.\n2. Qc6 \u2014 attacks the knight on f5 and keeps pressure.\n3. Qe4 \u2014 centralizes queen, attacks knight, and covers g2.\n4. Bf4 \u2014 attacks the bishop on d6.\n5. Be4 \u2014 attacks the knight and covers g2.\n\n**Deep calculation for Qxa8:**\n1. Qxa8 Rxa8 (if Black recaptures)\n2. Bxa8 \u2014 White is up a full rook.\n3. If Black tries Nh4, White can play Be4 or g3, defending.\n4. No immediate threats to White's king.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nQxa8 is the most direct and decisive move, winning a rook with no compensation for Black.\n\nMy move:\n```\nQxa8\n```"
