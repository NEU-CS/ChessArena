If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Qxh7+ (forces mate if possible)\n2. Qxg7+ (captures rook, but does it lead to mate?)\n3. d7 (pushes pawn, but is it urgent?)\n4. gxf3 (captures bishop, but is it safe?)\n5. Other queen moves (but Qxh7+ is forcing)\n\n**Let's check Qxh7+:**  \n- Qxh7+ Kxh7 (forced)\n- gxf3+ (if Black's bishop is still there, but after Kxh7, Black's king is on h7)\n- But after Qxh7+, Black cannot recapture with the king because the king is on h8 and the pawn is on h7. So Qxh7+ is check.\n\nWait:  \n- Qxh7+ Rxh7 (the rook on g7 can capture on h7)\n- Qxf8# (White's queen captures Black's queen on f8, checkmate, because the king is on h8 and cannot escape)\n\n**So, Qxh7+ Rxh7 Qxf8# is mate.**\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQxh7+\n```"
