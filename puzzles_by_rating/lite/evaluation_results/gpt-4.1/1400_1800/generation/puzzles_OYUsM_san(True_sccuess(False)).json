If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Rxe5 Bxe5 (if Black recaptures)\n- 27. Qxd3 Qxd3 (if Black trades queens)\n- 28. Bxd3 and White is up a piece.\n\nBut after 26. Rxe5, if Black plays 26... Rd1+ 27. Qxd1 Bxe5, White is still up a piece.\n\n**Is there any tactic for Black after Rxe5?**\n- 26. Rxe5 Bxe5 27. Qxd3 Qxd3 28. Bxd3 and White is up a piece.\n- If 26... Rd1+ 27. Qxd1 Bxe5, same result.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n- 26. Qxd3 is possible, but then 26... Nxd3 and Black gets a piece back.\n- 26. Qa4 attacks the rook, but Black can defend.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRxe5 wins a piece cleanly.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRxe5\n```"
