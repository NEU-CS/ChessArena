Qxd2+ 2. Kxd2 Rxc3 (threatening Rc2+ and mate ideas)\n- If 2. Kb1, then Rxc3, and Black is up a piece and has a crushing attack.\n\n**Check for tactics:**\n- After Qxd2+, White cannot avoid losing material or getting mated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is the forcing check, winning the bishop and keeping the initiative.\n\n```\nQxd2+\n```"
