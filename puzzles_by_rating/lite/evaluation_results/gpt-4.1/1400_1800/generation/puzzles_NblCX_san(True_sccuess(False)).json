If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If Kd2, then Nxf3+ is possible, forking king and rook.\n2. **Nxf3**: Captures a pawn, but after Qxf3, White's queen is centralized.\n3. **Qh6**: Attacks h2, but White can defend easily.\n4. **f6**: Kicks the queen, but weakens e6.\n5. **d4**: Opens the center, but White's king is on c1, so this could be dangerous for White.\n6. **Rad8**: Brings another rook to the center, but not as forcing as other options.\n\n**Calculation of Nd3+:**\n- 1...Nd3+ 2. Kd2 (if Kb1, then Qb4+ is strong)\n- 2...Nxf3+ 3. Kd1 (if exf3, then Qxf6 is strong for Black, up a piece)\n- If White plays Kd2, then Nxf3+ is a fork.\n\n**Calculation of d4:**\n- 1...d4 2. exd4 Nxf3 3. Qe4+ Qe7 4. Qxf3\n\n**Calculation of Nxf3:**\n- 1...Nxf3 2. Qxf3\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **Nd3+** is very strong, as it forces the White king to move and then allows Nxf3+, forking king and rook. This should win material and keep the initiative.\n\nMy move:\n```\nNd3+\n```"
