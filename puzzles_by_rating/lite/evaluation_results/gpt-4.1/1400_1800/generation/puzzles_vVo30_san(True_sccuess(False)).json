If Black plays h1=Q, White must be ready to deal with it.\n- If White plays **Nh5**, Black can play Nxh5, and after Nxh5, h1=Q, White can play Nf6+ and pick up the queen, but Black will have a knight for a queen, which is not ideal.\n- If White plays **Kxa3**, White removes the a3 pawn, but Black will play h1=Q, and White is not in time to stop it.\n- If White plays **Nh5**, Black can play Nxh5, and after Nxh5, h1=Q, White can play Nf6+ and after Kxf6, bxa6, but Black is up a queen for a knight.\n\nBut let's check if **Nh5** is the best move:\n- **Nh5** attacks the knight on f6. If Black ignores and plays h1=Q, White can play Nxf6, Kxf6, bxa6, but Black is up a queen for a knight.\n- If Black plays Nxh5, White recaptures with pawn, but h1=Q comes anyway.\n\nWhat about **Kxa3**?\n- **Kxa3** removes the a3 pawn, but Black plays h1=Q, and White is not in time to stop it.\n\nWhat about **c5**?\n- **c5** pushes the pawn, but doesn't address the h2 pawn.\n\nWhat about **Ka4**?\n- **Ka4** threatens to capture a3, but again, h1=Q.\n\nWhat about **Nf1**?\n- **Nf1** covers h2, but the knight is too far to stop the pawn.\n\nWhat about **Ne2**?\n- **Ne2** allows the knight to come to g3, but doesn't help.\n\nIs there any way to stop the h2 pawn? No, the pawn is unstoppable.\n\nSo, the best move is to maximize White's own chances. The most promising is to push the c-pawn with **c5**, creating a passed pawn and threatening to queen as well.\n\n**After c5:**\n- If Black plays bxc5, then bxa6, and White's b-pawn is very strong.\n- If Black plays h1=Q, White can play c6, and the c-pawn is very close to queening.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc5\n```"
