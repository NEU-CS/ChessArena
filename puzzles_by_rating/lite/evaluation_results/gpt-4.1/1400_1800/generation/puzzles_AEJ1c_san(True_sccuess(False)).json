When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Kh6\n\n- King moves to h6.\n- This puts the king on the edge, but also threatens to support h5-h6 ideas and possibly mate if Black is careless.\n- However, Black can check with Qf8+ or Qd2+, and White's king could be exposed.\n\n### 2. Kf4\n\n- King moves to f4.\n- Centralizes the king, but also exposes it to checks like Qd6+ or Qh4+.\n- Not obviously threatening anything immediate.\n\n### 3. Re7\n\n- Rook moves to e7.\n- This attacks the queen on d8.\n- If Black responds with Qxe7, then White can play Qxc5, winning a pawn and keeping pressure.\n- If Black moves the queen, White's rook is very active on the 7th rank, and Black's king is exposed.\n\n---\n\n#### Let's check for tactics:\n\n- After Re7, if Black plays Qxe7, then Qxc5 wins a pawn.\n- If Black plays Qd6, then Qxf7+ is possible, and White's attack continues.\n- Re7 is an active move, attacking the queen and threatening to invade.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Re7** is the most active move, attacking the queen and keeping the initiative. The king moves (Kh6, Kf4) do not create immediate threats and may expose the king to checks.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRe7\n```"
