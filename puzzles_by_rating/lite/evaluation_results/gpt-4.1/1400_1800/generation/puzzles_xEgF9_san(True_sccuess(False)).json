If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If White plays Rxf3, Black can recapture with the queen, but then White's rook is gone from e3, and Black can try to invade.\n- Qxc3 wins a piece (knight), but let's check if it's safe: Qxc3 Rxc3, and Black is up a piece.\n- Qxf2+ is a check, but after Kxf2, Black has no follow-up.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Qxc3: If White recaptures with Rxc3, Black is up a piece. No immediate mate threats for White.\n- Qf3+: If White plays Rxf3, Black can play Rxe3, winning the exchange, but White's queen is very active.\n\n**Best move:**\n- Qxc3 wins a piece outright with no compensation for White.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxc3\n```"
