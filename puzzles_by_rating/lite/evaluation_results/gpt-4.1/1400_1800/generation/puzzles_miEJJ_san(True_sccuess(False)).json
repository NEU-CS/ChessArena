Most defensive moves lose the exchange. However, **Rd3** attacks White's queen and threatens to exchange rooks, which may help reduce White's attacking chances. If White captures the rook, Black can recapture with the bishop, maintaining material balance and reducing White's attacking potential.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRd3\n```"
