Bb2 (defending e4) Bxb2 19. Qxb2 Qg5 (threatening Qxg3)\n- White's king is exposed, and Black has pressure.\n\nAlternatively, after 16...Nd4 17. Qc4+ Be6 18. Qxc5 Nc2, Black wins the exchange.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe move **Nd4** is a strong tactical shot, attacking both the queen and bishop, and opening up lines for Black's pieces.\n\nMy move:\n```\nNd4\n```"
