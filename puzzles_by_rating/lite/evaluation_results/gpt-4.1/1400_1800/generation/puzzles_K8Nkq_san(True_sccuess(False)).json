If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Bxf7+ Rxf7 (forced)\n2. Nxe5 Nxe5 (if ...Nxe5)\n3. d4 (attacks bishop and knight, gains space)\n\nBut after 2...Nxe5, White can play d4, and if cxd4, Qxd4, White has a strong center and initiative.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Bxf7+ Kxf7, 2. Nxe5+ Nxe5, 3. d4, White has a strong center.\n\n**Nxe5** immediately attacks the bishop and threatens Nxf7, but Black can play Nxe5, d4, and the position is similar.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBxf7+ is the most forcing and wins a pawn, with initiative.
