When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

The rook on e4 and queen on e3 are well-placed for an attack. The knight on e4 is centralized, and White has a passed b-pawn. Black's bishop on b7 is not very active, and the rook on c8 is defending the back rank.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Re7+ (immediate check, forcing the king to e8 or f8, or rook to capture)\n2. Nf5 (threatening mate on e7, but gxf3 is possible)\n3. Qd3 (threatening mate on h7, but Black can defend)\n4. f5 (trying to open lines, but Black can respond with ...g3)\n5. h3 (trying to break the pawn chain, but not urgent)\n6. b6 (pushing the passed pawn, but not immediately decisive)\n\nLet's calculate Re7+:\n- 41. Re7+ Kf8 (if Kg6, then f5+ is very strong)\n- 42. Nf5 (threatening mate on h6 and g7)\n- If ...Qe1+ 43. Qxe1 Rxc1 44. Qxc1 Bxd5 45. Qc8#\n\nAlternatively, after Re7+, if Black plays Qxe7, then Nxd6+ wins the rook.\n\nRe7+ seems to force Black's king to a worse position and keeps the initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRe7+\n```"
