Rxg2+**\n- If Kxg2, then Qg5+ (forking rook and king), but White can play Kf1 or Kh1.\n- If Kh1, then Qxh3# is mate.\n- If Kh3, then Qxh3+ is mate.\n\nBut after Rxg2+:\n- 1... Rxg2+ 2. Kxg2 Qg5+ 3. Kf1 (only move) Qxe5 (winning the rook)\n- 1... Rxg2+ 2. Kh1 Qxh3# (mate)\n\nBut after Rxg2+, if White plays Kh1, it's mate in one.\n\n**2. Qxh3+**\n- If gxh3, then Rg2# is mate.\n- If Kg1, then Qg2# is mate.\n\nSo Qxh3+ is a forced mate in two.\n\n**Let's check:**\n- 1... Qxh3+ 2. gxh3 Rg2# (mate)\n- 1... Qxh3+ 2. Kg1 Qg2# (mate)\n\nTherefore, **Qxh3+** is a forced mate in two, regardless of what White does.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is:\n```\nQxh3+\n```"
