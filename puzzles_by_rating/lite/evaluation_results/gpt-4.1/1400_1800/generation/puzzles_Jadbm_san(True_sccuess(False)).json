When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White's queen is very active on b7, and Black's king is exposed on d7. The bishop on a7 is also well placed, controlling key diagonals.\n\nTactical opportunities:  \n- Qc6+ is a forcing check, and the Black king cannot go to e6, d8, or c8 (all covered by White's pieces).  \n- Qxc7+ is also a check, but after Kxc7, White loses the queen for a pawn.  \n- Qc8+ is a check, but after Rxc8, White loses the queen for a rook.\n\nLet's look at Qc6+:\n\n1. Qc6+ Kd8 (only move)\n2. Bxb6 (threatening mate on a8 and c7)\n   - If Qd7, then Qa8+ wins the queen.\n   - If Qe6, then Qc7+ Ke8 Qd8+ Kf7 Qxh8 wins.\n\nAlternatively, Re7+ is a forcing move:\n\n1. Re7+ Qxe7 (forced)\n2. Qc6+ Kd8\n3. Bxb6 (as above)\n\nBut let's check Qc6+ in more detail:\n\n1. Qc6+ Kd8 (only move)\n2. Bxb6 (threatening mate)\n   - If Qd7, then Qa8+ wins the queen.\n   - If Qe6, then Qc7+ Ke8 Qd8+ Kf7 Qxh8 wins.\n\nSo Qc6+ looks very strong.\n\nLet's check for any better moves. Re7+ is also interesting:\n\n1. Re7+ Qxe7 (forced)\n2. Qc6+ Kd8\n3. Bxb6 (as above)\n\nBut this is the same as above, but with one less rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQc6+\n```"
