Qc6\n- Attacks the bishop on b7.\n- If Qxc6, then bxc6 and White is up material.\n- But Black cannot capture on c6, as the queen is on e8.\n- After Qc6, Black might play Bxc6, but then Rxc6 and White is up material.\n\n### 2. Nd5\n- Attacks the rook on f2 and bishop on b7.\n- If Nxd5, then Qxf8# is mate.\n- If Nxd5, then Qxf8# is mate.\n- If Bxc6, then Nxe7+ wins the exchange.\n- This move seems very strong.\n\n### 3. Ne4\n- Attacks the rook on f2 and knight on f4.\n- If Nxe4, then Qxf8# is mate.\n- If Rg2, then Qxf8# is mate.\n- If Bxe4+, then Nxe4 and White is up material.\n\n### 4. Rc6\n- Attacks the bishop on b7.\n- If Bxc6, then Qxc6 and White is up material.\n\n### 5. Qe4\n- Attacks the knight on f4.\n- If Qxe4, then Nxe4 and White is up material.\n\n### 6. Nf3\n- Attacks the rook on f2 and knight on f4.\n- If Nxf3, then Nxf3 and White is up material.\n\n### 7. Kg1\n- King move, not threatening.\n\n**Best move:**\n\nLet's check for tactics. The move **Nd5** attacks both the rook on f2 and the bishop on b7, and if Black captures with the knight, White has Qxf8# mate.\n\nLet's check: 37. Nd5 Nxd5 38. Qxf8#\n\nYes, this is mate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nNd5\n```"
