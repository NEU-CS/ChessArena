If Black does not address this, White will play Qh8#.\n- The only way to prevent mate is to play ...Qxf6, capturing the pawn and covering h8.\n\nLet's check if ...Qxf6 is safe:\n- 23...Qxf6\n- If White plays Qxf6, then Bxf6 and the mate threat is gone.\n- If White tries Qh7+, Kf8, and there is no follow-up.\n\nAre there any other ways to stop mate? No, because the only defender of h8 is the queen.\n\n**Other candidate moves:**\n- ...Nd7, ...Na6, ...Bc8, etc., do not address the mate threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only move is:\n```\nQxf6\n```"
