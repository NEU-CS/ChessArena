If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Bxf7+ Kxf7 (forced)\n2. Nxe5+ dxe5 (if ...Nxe5, then Qxh5+)\n3. Qxg4\n\nBut after 1. Bxf7+ Kxf7 2. Nxe5+ dxe5 3. Qxg4 Nf3+ 4. Qxf3+ Bxf3, White is up a pawn and Black's king is exposed.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider Nxd4:\n\n1. Nxd4 Bxd1\n2. Qxg4 Bxg4\n3. hxg4 exd4\n\nBut White loses the exchange.\n\nAnother candidate is Ng5, attacking the bishop on h5 and threatening Nxf7.\n\nLet's check Ng5:\n\n1. Ng5 hxg5 (if ...Bxg5, then Qxg4)\n2. hxg4 Bxg4\n3. Qxg4\n\nBut after Ng5, Black can play Bxg5, and after Qxg4, Black can play hxg5, and White is not gaining much.\n\nNow, let's check Bxh6:\n\n1. Bxh6 Nxh6\n2. Nxd4 exd4\n3. Qxh5\n\nBut after ...Bxh6, Black can play Nxh6, and White is not gaining much.\n\nNow, let's check Nxe5:\n\n1. Nxe5 dxe5\n2. hxg4\n\nBut then Black can play Bg6, and White is not gaining much.\n\nNow, let's check hxg4:\n\n1. hxg4 Bxg4\n2. Be3\n\nBut Black's bishop is active.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the most forcing and promising move is:\n\n```\nBxf7+\n```"
