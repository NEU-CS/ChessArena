Nf3 Qxg2\n2. Rf1 (defending f1)\n   - Now, if Black tries Bxf3, White can recapture with gxf3, opening the g-file.\n   - If Black tries Qxf1+, White can recapture with Bxf1.\n\nAlternatively, after Nf3, if Black plays Bxf3, White can play gxf3, and the queen on h7 is still active.\n\n#### What about **Be2**?\n\n1. Be2 Bxe2+\n2. Kxe2 Qxg2+\n3. Ke3 (only move)\n   - Now, Black can try Qg5+ or Qh3+, but the White king can escape to d3 or f2.\n\nBut this exposes the king, and White loses castling rights.\n\n#### **Ne2** is too passive.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Nf3** is the most active move, attacking the queen and bishop, and defending against the threat of Qf1#. After Nf3, White can meet Qxg2 with Rf1, and the position remains safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nNf3\n```"
