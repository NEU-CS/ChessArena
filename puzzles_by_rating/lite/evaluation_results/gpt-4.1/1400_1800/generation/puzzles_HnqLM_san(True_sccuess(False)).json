When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

The c6 pawn is one square from queening, and Black's queen is attacking it from c3.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. c7 (pushes the pawn, threatening to queen)\n2. Nb7 (defends c6, supports c7-c8=Q)\n3. Nc4 (attacks e5 bishop, but doesn't defend c6)\n4. Qa7 (threatens c7-c8=Q, but queen is far from the king)\n5. Qc5 (attacks e5 bishop, but queen is passive)\n6. Kh3 (king safety, but not urgent)\n7. f4 (attacks bishop, but weakens king)\n\nCritical lines:\n- c7 is tempting, but Black can play Qxc7, winning the pawn.\n- Nb7 defends c6 and threatens c7-c8=Q.\n- If Nb7, Black can try Qxb2, but then c7 and the pawn is unstoppable.\n\nLet's check Nb7:\n1. Nb7 Qxb2+ (if Black tries to grab a pawn)\n2. Kh3 (safe)\n   - Now c7 is coming, and Black can't stop c8=Q.\n\nAlternatively, after Nb7, if Black plays Qxc6, White recaptures with Nb7xc6, and White is still up a piece.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nNb7\n```"
