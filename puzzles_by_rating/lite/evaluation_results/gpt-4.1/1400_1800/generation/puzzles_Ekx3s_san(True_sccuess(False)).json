When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Bxc7 Qxc7 (if ...Qxc7)\n- 8. Qxb7 Rc8 (threatening ...Na5 trapping the queen)\n- 9. Qb3 Na5 (queen is trapped)\nSo, Bxc7 is not safe due to the queen trap.\n\n**Tactical check on d5:**\n- 7. d5 Na5 (attacks the queen)\n- 8. Qc3 Nxc4\n- 9. Qxc4 exd5\n- White is still active, but let's see if there is something better.\n\n**Qxb7:**\n- 7. Qxb7 Rb8\n- 8. Qxc7 Qxc7\n- 9. Bxc7 Rxb2\n- Black gets some activity, but White is up a pawn.\n\n**Best move:**\nGiven the above, the safest and most promising move is **d5**, opening the center while Black's king is stuck and maintaining the initiative.\n\n```\nd5\n```"
