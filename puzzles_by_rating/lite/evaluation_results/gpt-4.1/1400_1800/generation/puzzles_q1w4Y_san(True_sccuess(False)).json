If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Qh4\n   - Bxf8 Qxg4 (threatening mate on g2, and Black is better)\n   - Nf6+ Qxf6 Qxf6 Bxf2+ Kf2 (Black is down material, but White's attack is gone)\n   - Qxd5 (White grabs a pawn, but Black can play Qxh6)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nQh4 is the best move, as it forces White to decide between material and attack, and gives Black counterplay.\n\nMy move:\n```\nQh4\n```"
