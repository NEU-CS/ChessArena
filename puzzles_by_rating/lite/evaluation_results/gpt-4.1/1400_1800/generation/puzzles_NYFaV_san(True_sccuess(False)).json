If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Let's see what happens if we play Nxe6+.\n\n1. Nxe6+ Qxe6 (forced, otherwise Black loses the queen)\n2. f5 (attacking the queen, but the queen can move)\n3. Qxg4 (removes the dangerous g4 pawn)\n\nBut after Nxe6+ Qxe6, White can play f5, opening the f-file and threatening f6+.\n\nAlternatively, after Nxe6+, if Black plays Kxe6, then Qxg4+ picks up the g4 pawn and White is better.\n\n**Other candidate moves:**\n- Nh7: attacks the rook, but Black can play Rxh7.\n- Ne4: attacks the queen, but the queen can move.\n- Qxg4: captures the pawn, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n- f5: attacks the queen, but Black can play Qxf5.\n\n**Best move:**\nNxe6+ is a forcing move, and it wins material (the queen for a knight). Let's check if there are any tactics after Nxe6+ Qxe6.\n\nAfter Nxe6+ Qxe6, White can play f5, attacking the queen and threatening f6+.\n\nLet's check the lines:\n\n1. Nxe6+ Qxe6\n2. f5 Qxf5 (if Qxf5)\n3. Qc7 (threatening Qd6#)\n\nBut after Qc7, Black can play Qe4+ and exchange queens.\n\nAlternatively, after Nxe6+ Kxe6, White can play Qxg4+ and is up material.\n\nGiven all this, the best move is:\n\n```\nNxe6+\n```"
