If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Rxg2+  \n- If 2. Kh1, then Qg2#  \n- If 2. fxg2, then Qxg2#  \n- If 2. K moves to h1, same result.\n\nSo, Rxg2+ is a forced mate in 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxg2+\n```"
