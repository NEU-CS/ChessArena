If White gets a move, g8=Q is coming.\n- The rook on c1 can support the pawn or cut off the Black king.\n\n**Black's options:**\n- The bishop can give check with Be6+.\n- The king can move to a3, a2, or b3.\n- The bishop can move to several squares, but only Be6+ is a check.\n- The a6 and b5 pawns can advance.\n\n**Critical analysis:**\n- If White gets to play g8=Q, Black must have a way to stop the new queen.\n- If Be6+, White's king must move. Let's see what happens:\n\n1. ... Be6+  \n   - If Kf8, then ... Kxc1 wins the rook.\n   - If Kh8, then ... Kxc1 wins the rook.\n\nBut after ...Kxc1, White plays g8=Q, and Black is up a rook for a bishop, but White has a queen.\n\nLet's check the lines:\n\n**Line 1:**\n1. ... Be6+  \n2. Kf8 (or Kh8) Kxc1  \n3. g8=Q+ Bxg8  \n4. Rxc1+ Kb2  \n5. Rc6 a5  \n6. Ke7 a4  \n7. Kd6 a3  \n8. Kc5 a2  \n9. Kxb5 a1=Q\n\nBut after 3. g8=Q+, Black can take the queen with Bxg8, so White cannot queen safely.\n\nWait, but after 2. ... Kxc1, White plays g8=Q, and Black can play Bxg8, but then White has Rxc1+ and can try to stop the pawns.\n\nLet's check if White can win after that.\n\nBut first, let's check if there is a forced win for Black.\n\nAlternatively, can Black play a5 or b4 to try to promote?\n\nBut the most forcing move is Be6+.\n\n**Let's check Be6+:**\n\n1. ... Be6+  \n2. Kf8 (or Kh8) Kxc1  \n3. g8=Q+ Bxg8  \n4. Rxc1+ Kb2  \n5. Rc6 a5  \n6. Ke7 a4  \n7. Kd6 a3  \n8. Kc5 a2  \n9. Kxb5 a1=Q\n\nBlack will queen first, and White's king is far away. Black should win.\n\n**Alternatively, if White tries to avoid losing the rook:**\n\nAfter 1. ... Be6+, if White plays Kh7, then Kxc1, and g8=Q+ Bxg8, Rxc1+ Kb2, Rc6, and the same line.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is the forcing check:\n\n```\nBe6+\n```"
