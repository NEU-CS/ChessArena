If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If exd4, cxd4, the bishop is still pinning the queen.\n4. **Re6**: Defends the knight and prepares to double rooks, but White can play c4, increasing pressure.\n5. **Qf5**: Offers a queen trade, but White can play Qxf5, Bxf5, and Black's position is still cramped.\n6. **Nb4**: Attacks c2, but White can simply play cxb4.\n7. **Na7**: Retreats the knight, but it's passive.\n8. **d4**: Pushes the pawn, but White can play cxd4, and the position opens up for White's pieces.\n\n**Best move consideration:**\n- **Nd4** is interesting because it activates the knight and attacks c2, forcing White to respond. If exd4, cxd4, the bishop is still pinning the queen, but Black has more activity.\n- **Qe6** is solid, offering a queen trade and relieving pressure.\n- **Re6** is defensive, but not active.\n\nAfter careful consideration, **Nd4** is the most active and challenging move, putting pressure on White and forcing them to make a decision.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nNd4\n```"
