If Kxg2, then Qe4+ picks up the knight on g4, or Qe2+ with threats.\n2. **Qe6**: Defends the knight on g4, but doesn't address the immediate threats.\n3. **Ne4**: Attacks the bishop on g3, but White can play Nxe7+.\n4. **Nxh3+**: Sacrifices the knight for a pawn, but doesn't seem to lead anywhere.\n5. **g6**: Kicks the knight, but Nxh6+ is dangerous.\n\nLet's calculate **Rxg2+**:\n\n1. ... Rxg2+  \n   2. Kxg2 Qe4+  \n   3. Nf3 (forced, blocks check) Qxg4  \n   4. Nxe7+ Rxe7  \n   5. Qxd6 (threatening Qxe7)  \n   Black is up material (rook for two pieces), but White has some initiative.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. ... Rxg2+ 2. Kh1 (instead of Kxg2), then Qe4 (threatening Qxg2# and Qg2+), but White can play Qf3.\n\n**Is Rxg2+ safe?**\n- After Rxg2+ Kxg2 Qe4+ Nf3 Qxg4, Black wins a piece and is up material.\n\n**Other moves** don't seem as strong.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is the tactical shot:\n\n```\nRxg2+\n```"
