If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Qxa4 2. Ne7+ Kb8 (forced) 3. Bxa4, White wins a pawn and Black's king is exposed.\n- If 1... Qxd5 2. Qxd5 cxd5 3. Bxd7+ Rxd7 4. Nxh4, White is up material.\n- If 1... cxd5 2. Bxd7+ Rxd7 3. Qxf6, White is up a piece.\n- If 1... Be5, White can play Nxe5, and after Nxe5, Qxf6, White is up a piece.\n- If 1... Rhg8, Black brings a rook to the open file, but White's threats remain.\n\n**Best Defensive Move:**\n- **Kb8**: Moves the king off the c-file, avoids any checks on c7, and prepares to bring the rook to c8 if needed. This is a prophylactic move, improving king safety and keeping options open.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nKb8\n```"
