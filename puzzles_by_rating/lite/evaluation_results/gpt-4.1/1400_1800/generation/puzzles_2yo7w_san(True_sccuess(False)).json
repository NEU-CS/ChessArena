If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

White has no immediate threats.\n- **Qxf3**: After Qxf3, Bxf3, White's bishop is strong, and Black's queen is offside.\n- **Qh2**: White can play Kd2 or Rh1, defending.\n- **d5**: The center opens, but Black's king is still in the center, which is risky.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to castle kingside, bringing the king to safety and connecting the rooks. This also prepares to bring the rook to the g-file for potential attack.\n\nMy move:\n```\nO-O\n```"
