When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is somewhat active, but White's rook is well placed.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **Rxf5+**: Captures the f5 pawn with check. This is forcing and removes a dangerous passed pawn.\n2. **d7**: Pushes the pawn, threatening to promote, but Black can play Rd1 and d8=Q is not possible yet.\n3. **Rf8**: Prepares to support d7-d8=Q, but Black can try Rh7 or Rd1.\n4. **Kc5**: Centralizes the king, but not as forcing as Rxf5+.\n5. **Other rook moves**: Not as forcing as Rxf5+.\n\nLet's analyze **Rxf5+**:\n- If ...Kxf5, then d7 and the pawn is unstoppable (Rd1, d8=Q).\n- If ...Kg4, White can play d7, and the pawn is still unstoppable.\n\nLet's check:\n1. Rxf5+ Kxf5\n   - d7 Rd1\n   - d8=Q Rxd8\n   - c5 (White has a passed pawn, but Black has an extra rook. Not ideal.)\n\nBut after Rxf5+, if Black plays Kg4:\n- Rxf5+ Kg4\n  - d7 Rd1\n  - Rd5 (attacking the d7 pawn), but White can play c5 and support the pawn.\n\nAlternatively, let's check **d7** immediately:\n- d7 Rd1\n- d8=Q Rxd8\n- c5 (same as above)\n\nSo, **Rxf5+** removes the f5 pawn and gives White a clear path to promote the d-pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxf5+\n```"
