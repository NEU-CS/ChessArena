When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Activate the rook: Rh1, Rg1, Rf1, Re1, Rd1, Rc1, Rb1\n2. Advance pawns: h3, g3, f3, a3, h4, g4, f4, a4\n3. Move the knight: Ne5, Nc5, Nf4, Nb4, Nb2, Ne1, Nc1\n4. Move the king: Kf4, Kd4, Kf3, Ke2\n\nLet's consider activating the rook. The rook on a1 is not doing much. Bringing it to the center or to the kingside could be useful.\n\n- Re1: Challenges the e-file, but Black's rook is already there.\n- Rd1: Centralizes the rook, attacks the knight on e4.\n- Rc1: Prepares to invade the c-file, but there are no targets.\n- Rb1: Not useful.\n- Rh1, Rg1, Rf1: Prepare to swing the rook to the kingside, but not immediately threatening.\n\nRd1 attacks the knight on e4, forcing Black to react. If Black plays Nxf2+, White can play Ke2 and the knight is trapped.\n\nLet's check this line:\n1. Rd1 Nxf2+ \n2. Ke2 Nxd1 \n3. Rxd1\n\nBut then White loses the knight for a rook, which is not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, what about challenging the knight with Ne5? That would force a trade or push the knight away.\n\n1. Ne5 Rxe5 (if Black exchanges)\n2. f3 (attacking the knight)\nBut then Black can play Nc5+ and pick up the pawn on a2.\n\nAlternatively, what about f3? This attacks the knight and forces it to move.\n\n1. f3 Nc5+ (check)\n2. Kd2 (or Kc4) and the knight has to move.\n\nBut after f3, if Nc5+, Kd2, the knight is attacked and must move.\n\nAlternatively, what about activating the king with Kd4? This centralizes the king and supports pawn advances.\n\nBut the most forcing move is f3, attacking the knight and asking it where it wants to go.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\nf3\n```"
