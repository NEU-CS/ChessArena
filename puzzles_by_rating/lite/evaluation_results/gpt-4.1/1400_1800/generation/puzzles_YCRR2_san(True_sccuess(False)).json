When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Rb8: Invades the 8th rank, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.\n2. Rb7: Attacks g7 pawn, threatens Rg7+ and possibly e5+.\n3. Rb6+: Checks the king, but after ...Kf7, the rook is a bit awkward.\n4. Rb5: Cuts off the king, but not very active.\n5. Rd4: Centralizes, but not threatening.\n6. Rc4: Similar.\n7. Rb3: Retreat, not active.\n8. Rb2: Retreat, not active.\n9. Rb1: Retreat, not active.\n10. e5+: Pawn push with check, but after ...Kf5, Black's king is more active.\n11. a5: Pawn push, but not urgent.\n12. f4: Pawn push, but doesn't do much.\n\nMost promising: Rb7, attacking g7, threatening Rg7+ and possibly e5+.\n\nLet's check Rb7:\n- Rb7 threatens Rg7, which would force the king to move (if the pawn is taken).\n- If Black plays ...g5+, White can play Kg3 or Kg4.\n- If Black plays ...Ke6, White can play Rxg7.\n\nAlternatively, e5+:\n- e5+ Kf5, then Rb5, but Black's king is more active.\n\nTherefore, Rb7 is the most active, keeps pressure, and threatens to win a pawn.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nRb7\n```"
