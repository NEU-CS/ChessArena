When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is somewhat exposed, and White has active pieces.\n\nTactical considerations:\n- The move Rh8+ is a forcing check, and if Black plays Kxh8, then Nf7+ is a fork, winning the rook on f6.\n- If Black plays Kg7 after Rh8+, then White can continue with Rxe8, winning the exchange.\n- The move Nxg6 is also tempting, attacking the rook on f8 and threatening Ne7+.\n\nLet's calculate Rh8+:\n1. Rh8+ Kxh8 (forced)\n2. Nf7+ Kg7 (forced)\n3. Nxd6 (winning the rook on f6)\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Rh8+ Kg7, 2. Rxe8 is possible.\n\nLet's check for any better moves:\n- Rxf5: captures a pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n- Nxc6: wins a pawn, but less forcing.\n- c5+: attacks the bishop, but not as strong as the check.\n\nTherefore, the most forcing and promising move is:\n```\nRh8+\n```"
