If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After Qxc8, Rxc8, White loses the queen for a rook, which is not favorable unless there is a follow-up.\n2. **Qxf5**: Captures a pawn, threatens Qe6+ and Qxg6. But after gxf5, White's rook can swing to g3 with check.\n3. **e4**: Opens the center, but Black's queen is very active.\n4. **Ra2**: Defends the c2 pawn, but passive.\n5. **Qc7**: Attacks b7, but Black can defend.\n6. **Qc4**: Attacks h4, but not very forcing.\n\n**Tactical Calculation:**\n- **Qxf5**: If gxf5, then Rg3+ wins the queen after Qd2+ Kg1 Qe1+ Kh2 Qxg3+ Kxg3. But after Qxf5, Black can play Qd2+ and try to force a perpetual or worse.\n\n- **Qc8+**: If Kh7, then Qxd8 Rxd8, White is up a rook for a bishop and pawn, but Black's attack is dangerous.\n\n- **Qc7**: Attacks b7, but not forcing.\n\n- **e4**: Opens the center, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **Qc8+** is the most forcing. If Black plays Kh7, then Qxd8 Rxd8, White is up material and can consolidate. If Black plays Bf8, then Qxd8 Rxd8, again White is up.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQc8+\n```"
