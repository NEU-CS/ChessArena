If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

If Black plays Rxa6, White will recapture with the rook, and Black loses the passed pawn. If Black plays Rb7, the a6 pawn is defended, and Black can prepare to push b4 and c4, creating a dangerous passed pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRb7\n```"
