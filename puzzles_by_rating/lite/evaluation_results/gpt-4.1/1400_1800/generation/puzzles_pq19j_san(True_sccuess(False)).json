When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is a bit exposed on g6, but not under immediate threat.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. ...Bxc4: Captures the bishop, but after Rg3+ Kh6, White's rook is active.\n2. ...Rcd7: Doubles rooks on the d-file, defending d5 and preparing to contest the open file.\n3. ...Ne6: Attacks the rook on e5, but after Bxd5, Rxd5, White can trade pieces.\n4. ...Rcc6: Doubles rooks on the c-file, but White's bishop is strong.\n5. ...Nb6: Attacks the rook on c4, but White can move it.\n\nThe most solid move is to double rooks on the d-file, defending the bishop and preparing to contest the open file. This also keeps the position stable and avoids tactical shots.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nRcd7\n```"
