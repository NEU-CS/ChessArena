If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Qxc6 (captures the attacking Knight, but what happens after bxc6?)\n2. Qd6 (retreats the Queen, but loses the Knight on d5)\n3. Qe7 (retreats the Queen, but again, Knight is lost)\n4. Qb8 (retreats the Queen, Knight is lost)\n5. Nxe3+ (check, but after Bxe3, Queen is still attacked)\n6. Qxf4+ (check, but after exf4, Queen is lost)\n7. Nb4 (attacks the Queen on a6, but after axb4, Queen is still attacked)\n8. Qd8 (retreats the Queen, Knight is lost)\n9. Qe5 (retreats the Queen, Knight is lost)\n10. Qb7 (Queen exchange, but after Qxb7, Knight is lost)\n\n**Let's calculate Qxc6:**\n- Qxc6 bxc6, now the Knight is gone, but Black is up a piece for a pawn.\n- But after bxc6, White threatens c7, but Black has Rxc6.\n\n**Let's check for tactics:**\n- Qxc6 bxc6 Nxe3+ Bxe3 Nxe3+ Kf3 Nf5, but White is up material.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n- Qxc6 seems forced, as otherwise Black loses the Queen.\n\n**Let's check Qxc6:**\n- Qxc6 bxc6 Nxe3 (forking King and Rook) Bxe3 Nxe3+ Kf3 Nf5, but White is up material.\n\n**Is there a way to avoid losing material?**\n- No, Qxc6 is forced.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQxc6\n```"
