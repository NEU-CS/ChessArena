If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Still exposed to checks, but less so than Kg4.\n   - The king is still somewhat active, but not as much as before.\n\n3. **Kg2:** \n   - Retreats the king further, possibly to safety, but also disconnects the king from the center and queenside action.\n   - The king is less active, but safer.\n\n4. **Ke2:** \n   - Moves the king towards the queenside and centralizes it.\n   - However, this could walk into a pin or a check from Black's rook or bishop, especially with the pawn on d6.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- If White's king moves away from the f3 square, Black may try ...Rf2+ or ...Rg7+ to harass the king.\n- White's rook on d3 is blocking the d-pawn, but if the king moves, the rook could become more active.\n- White needs to be careful not to allow Black's a-pawn to promote.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- White's king is relatively safe on the third rank, but needs to avoid checks.\n- White may want to double rooks on the h-file or bring the h1 rook into play.\n- White should also consider attacking Black's weak pawns or supporting the advance of the h-pawn.\n\n**Best move:**\n- Of the available moves, **Kg2** is the safest, as it avoids checks and keeps the king out of immediate danger. The king can later support the advance of the h-pawn or help defend against Black's a-pawn. The other moves either expose the king or move it away from the action.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nKg2\n```"
