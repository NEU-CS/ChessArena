If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Let's see what happens:\n    - 1. Rb8+ Kc6 (if Ka5, then Qxa7#)\n    - 2. Qb7# (if Kc6)\n\nSo, after 1. Rb8+, if Black plays Kc6, then Qb7# is mate.\nIf Black plays Ka5, then Qxa7# is mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Rb8+ is a forced mate in one or two, depending on Black's reply.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRb8+\n```"
