If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Other moves allow mate or lose material.\n\n**Double-check:**\n- After Nf8, White can try Rxf4, but then Nxf4, and Black is fine.\n- After Nf8, White doesn't have an immediate mate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nNf8\n```"
