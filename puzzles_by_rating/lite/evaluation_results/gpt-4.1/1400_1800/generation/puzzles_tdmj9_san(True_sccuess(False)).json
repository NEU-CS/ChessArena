Qe3, then Rd1+ is strong.\n- If 23. Qf3, then Qxf3 gxf3, Rd1+ wins the bishop.\n- If 23. Qe1, then Qxf2+ and then Qxg2# is threatened.\n\n**Qxe5**:\n- 22...Qxe5 23. Qxe5 Rd1+ 24. Rxd1 Rxd1# is mate.\n- But after 22...Qxe5, White can play 23. Qxe5 Rd1+ 24. Rxd1 Rxd1#.\n\nBut wait, after 22...Qxe5 23. Qxe5 Rd1+ 24. Rxd1 Rxd1# is checkmate.\n\nTherefore, **Qxe5** wins immediately by force.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nQxe5\n```"
