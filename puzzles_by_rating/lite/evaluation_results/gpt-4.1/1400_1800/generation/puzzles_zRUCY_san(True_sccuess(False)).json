When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Bxc1 (if White captures, but that's not possible, as the bishop is on g5)\n- 1...c1=Q 2. d5 (try to activate the pawn, but Black is up a queen)\n- 1...c1=Q 2. Bxc1 is not possible.\n\n**Is there any reason to underpromote?**\n- No, promoting to a queen is best.\n\n**Are there any better moves than promoting?**\n- No, promoting to a queen is decisive.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nc1=Q\n```"
