When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n1bb3k1/5ppp/p3p3/2PrP3/8/2B5/5PPP/1R4K1 w - - 0 26\n\n**White to move.**\n\n### 1. Material Count\n- White: Rook (b1), Bishop (c3), 6 pawns, King (g1)\n- Black: Rook (d5), Bishop (c8), Bishop (b8), 6 pawns, King (g8)\n\nMaterial is even.\n\n### 2. Piece Activity\n- White's rook is on b1, eyeing the b-file.\n- White's bishop is on c3, controlling the long diagonal.\n- Black's rook is active on d5.\n- Black's bishops are on b8 and c8, both somewhat passive.\n- Black's king is on g8, White's on g1.\n\n### 3. Pawn Structure\n- Both sides have healthy pawn structures.\n- White has a pawn on e5, which is advanced and restricts Black's pieces.\n\n### 4. Candidate Moves\nLet's look at the legal moves and see which ones are promising:\n\n#### Moves involving the bishop (c3):\n- c3a5: Bishop to a5, attacks the rook on d5.\n- c3d4: Bishop to d4, attacks the rook on d5.\n- c3b4: Bishop to b4, attacks the rook on d5.\n- c3d2, c3b2, c3e1, c3a1: Retreats, not active.\n- c3a1: Retreat, not active.\n\n#### Rook moves:\n- b1b8: Rook to b8, attacks the bishop on b8.\n- b1b7: Rook to b7, attacks the pawn on f7.\n- b1b6: Rook to b6, attacks the pawn on a6.\n- b1b5: Rook to b5, attacks the bishop on b8 and the pawn on a6.\n- b1b4, b1b3, b1b2: Not very active.\n- b1f1, b1e1, b1d1, b1c1, b1a1: Lateral moves, not active.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- c5c6: Pawn to c6, attacks the bishop on b8.\n- h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4: Pawn moves, not urgent.\n\n### 5. Tactics and Threats\n\n#### c5c6\n- c5c6 attacks the bishop on b8.\n- If Black plays ...Bc7, then Rb7 attacks f7.\n- If ...Ba7, then Ba5 attacks the rook on d5.\n- If ...Bxe5, then Bxe5 Rxe5 Rxb8+ is very strong for White.\n\n#### Rb8\n- Rb8 attacks the bishop on b8, but Black can simply move the bishop.\n\n#### Bishop moves attacking the rook\n- c3a5, c3d4, c3b4: All attack the rook on d5.\n- If ...Rxe5, then Bxe5 Bxe5 Rxb8+ is good for White.\n\n### 6. Best Move Calculation\n\nLet's calculate **c5c6** in detail:\n- 1. c5c6 Bc7 (if ...Ba7, then Ba5 wins the rook)\n- 2. Rb7 attacks f7, but Black can defend with Rc5 or Rc8.\n- If Black plays ...Bxe5, then Bxe5 Rxe5 Rxb8+ is winning for White.\n\nAlternatively, **c3a5**:\n- 1. c3a5 Rxe5 (if ...Bxe5, then Bxe5 Rxe5 Rxb8+)\n- 2. Bxe5 Bxe5 Rxb8+ Bxb8 Rxb8#\n\nBut after c3a5, Black can play ...Bxe5, and after Bxe5 Rxe5 Rxb8+ Bxb8 Rxb8#, White wins.\n\n### 7. Conclusion\n\n**c5c6** is the most forcing move, attacking the bishop and threatening to win material. If Black responds poorly, White can win a piece or get a decisive attack.\n\n### Final Move\n\n```\nc5c6\n```"
