White's knight could become more active.\n- White could play Nf4, attacking d5.\n- Not optimal; king should stay close to the pawn.\n\n### 2. **c4d4 (Kc4-d4)**\n- King moves forward, supporting the pawn and threatening to advance.\n- White could play Nf4, but then d4-d3 is possible.\n- White's king is far away, so Black can try to push the pawn.\n\n### 3. **c4d3 (Kc4-d3)**\n- King moves to d3, attacking the knight.\n- White must move the knight, e.g., Nf4.\n- After Nf4, Black can play d4 and try to push the pawn.\n- This move forces the knight to a less central square.\n\n### 4. **c4c3 (Kc4-c3)**\n- King steps back, away from the pawn, which is not ideal.\n- White could play Nf4, attacking d5.\n- Not optimal.\n\n### 5. **c4b3 (Kc4-b3)**\n- King moves away from the pawn, not ideal.\n- White could play Nf4, attacking d5.\n- Not optimal.\n\n### 6. **d5d4 (d5-d4)**\n- Pushes the pawn immediately.\n- White can play Nf4, attacking the pawn on d4.\n- After Nf4, if Black plays Kc3, White can play Kf3 and approach the pawn.\n- The pawn could become weak and blockaded.\n\n---\n\n**Best Candidate Moves:**  \n- c4d4 (King to d4)\n- c4d3 (King to d3)\n\nLet's compare these two:\n\n#### After **c4d4**:\n- White plays Nf4, attacking d5.\n- Black can play d4, but then White can play Kf3, and the knight and king coordinate to blockade the pawn.\n\n#### After **c4d3**:\n- White must move the knight, e.g., Nf4.\n- Now Black can play d4, and the king is very close to support the pawn's advance.\n- The king on d3 is more active and can help shepherd the pawn forward.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**c4d3** is the best move. It attacks the knight, forces it to move, and keeps the king close to the pawn, maximizing Black's winning chances.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nc4d3\n```"

If Black pushes d5d4, White's king is too far to stop the pawn directly.\n- After d5d4, White will likely push b6, trying to promote their pawn.\n- Let's see the race:\n    - 1... d5d4\n    - 2. b6 d3\n    - 3. b7 d2\n    - 4. b8=Q d1=Q\n- Both sides queen, but Black queens first. However, White's king is on g2, so Black can check and win the b-pawn or force a favorable queen endgame.\n\n### Candidate 2: King moves (d3e4, d3d4, d3c4, etc.)\n- Moving the king does not threaten to promote the pawn as quickly.\n- For example, after d3e4, White plays b6, and the pawn race is the same, but Black is a tempo behind.\n- If Black plays d3d4 (king to d4), White plays b6, and again, Black is not advancing the pawn.\n\n### Candidate 3: King to c4 (d3c4)\n- This attacks the b5 pawn, but after b6, Black cannot capture the pawn in time before White promotes.\n- 1... Kc4 2. b6 d4 3. b7 d3 4. b8=Q d2 5. Qd6, and White can stop the pawn.\n\n### Calculation of the pawn race:\n- If Black pushes d5d4, Black queens first and can use checks to win the b-pawn or force a queen trade.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The best move is to push the pawn immediately with **d5d4**. This gives Black the best chance to queen first and win the game.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nd5d4\n```"

White will simply push b7 and promote.\n\n### 4. **d3c3** (King to c3)\n- This move keeps the king close to the b-pawn and supports the d-pawn.\n- After b7, Kc3-b4, and if b8=Q, d3-d2, but White's queen will easily stop the pawn.\n\n### 5. **d3e2** (King to e2)\n- This move is too far from the queenside and does not help.\n\n### 6. **d3d2** (King to d2)\n- This keeps the king on the d-file but does not threaten the b-pawn.\n\n### 7. **d3c2** (King to c2)\n- This move attacks the b-pawn from the side.\n- After b7, Kc2-b3, but again, White will promote.\n\n---\n\n## **Critical Analysis**\n\nThe only way for Black to have any drawing chances is to try to capture the b6 pawn. The move **d3c4** attacks the b6 pawn directly. Let's see what happens after this:\n\n- 1... Kc4\n- 2. b7 (White must push)\n- 2... Kb5 (attacking the pawn)\n- 3. b8=Q+ (White promotes)\n- 3... Kc4 (Black returns to c4, but White has a queen)\n\nNow, White's king is far away, but the queen alone can stop the d-pawn. Black's only hope is to try to advance the d-pawn and hope for stalemate tricks, but with best play, White wins.\n\nIf White tries to bring the king closer instead of pushing, Black can take the b6 pawn and then try to push the d-pawn, but White's king is close enough to stop it.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**d3c4** is the best move. It attacks the b6 pawn and forces White to push, giving Black the best practical drawing chances, though objectively White is winning.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nd3c4\n```"
