When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nThe reasoning process should describe how the Assistant analyzes the position and decide on the best move, including: \n- A strategic evaluation of the position. \n- A comparison of key candidate moves. \n- For each candidate, consider the opponent\u2019s likely response and outcome. \n- Conclude with a clear justification for your final choice.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal move:**  \nh8h7\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Strategic Evaluation**\n\n- **Material:**  \n  Black is down significant material. White has two rooks, a queen, a bishop, and a knight for Black's two rooks, queen, and a bishop. Black is also down pawns and under heavy attack.\n\n- **King Safety:**  \n  Black's king on h8 is extremely exposed. White's queen on h7 and knight on e7, supported by the f6 pawn, are threatening mate. The only legal move is to move the king to h7.\n\n- **Threats:**  \n  White threatens Qg7# (mate), and the knight on e7 covers key escape squares. Black's only move is to get out of check.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Candidate Moves**\n\n- The only legal move is **h8h7** (Kh7).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Opponent's Likely Response**\n\nAfter **h8h7**, let's see what White can do:\n\n- **Qg7#** is not possible because the king is now on h7.\n- White can play **Rh3+** (rook lift to h3, check), which forces the king to move to h8, and then White can play Qh6+ and continue the attack.\n- Alternatively, White can try to bring more pieces into the attack, but Black is lost in all lines.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Conclusion**\n\n- There is only one legal move: **h8h7**.\n- Black is in a hopeless position, but must play the only legal move.\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nh8h7\n```"
