If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Let's check: Rxe5 Rd1+ forces Kh2, then Black can try Rd2, but White is up a piece.)\n2. **Rxf7** (attacks f7, but after Rxf7 Rxf7 Rxe5, White wins a piece.)\n3. **Re7** (doubles on the 7th, but not as forcing as the captures.)\n4. **Rb8** (checks, but Black plays Rxb8 and White loses a rook.)\n\nLet's check the captures:\n\n**1. Rxe5**\n- Rxe5 Bxe5 is not possible, since it's a capture.\n- Rxe5 Rd1+ (trying to get counterplay)\n  - Kh2 (only move)\n  - Rd2 (threatening mate on d1, but White can play Rc4 or Re2)\n  - Rc4 (defends c2 and covers d2)\n  - Black has no more threats, White is up a piece.\n\n**2. Rxf7**\n- Rxf7 Rxf7 Rxe5, White wins a piece (since the bishop is unprotected).\n- After Rxf7, if Black plays Rd1+, then Kh2, and White is still up a piece.\n\n**Which is better: Rxe5 or Rxf7?**\n- Both win a piece, but Rxf7 is more forcing, as it immediately attacks f7 and then picks up the bishop.\n\n**Let's check for any tactical issues after Rxf7:**\n- Rxf7 Rxf7 Rxe5 Rd1+ Kh2 Rd2 (threatening mate), but White can play Rc4 or Re2 and defend.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth Rxe5 and Rxf7 win a piece, but Rxf7 is more forcing and keeps the initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxf7\n```"
