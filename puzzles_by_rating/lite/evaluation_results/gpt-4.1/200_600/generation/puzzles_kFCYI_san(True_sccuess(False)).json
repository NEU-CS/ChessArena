When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If Kb7, then Rxb7+ Ka8 (only move), and then Rxa6+ is possible, but Black's rook on c4 covers a6. If Ka5, then R6b5+ is possible, but Black can play Kxa4.\n2. **Rb7**: Invading the 7th rank, attacking f7 and threatening Rxa7+.\n3. **Bxd4**: Captures a pawn, but after Rxd4, White loses the bishop.\n4. **a5**: Pushes the passed pawn, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n5. **Bh6**: Attacks g7, but Black can defend easily.\n6. **Re2**: Doubles rooks on the e-file, but not immediately threatening.\n\n**Deep calculation:**\n- **Rb6+** Kxa4 (if Ka5, R6b5+ Ka4, R1b4+ Ka3, Rb3+ Ka2, R1b2+ Ka1, Ra3# is mate!) Let's check this line:\n\n1. Rb6+ Ka5\n2. R6b5+ Ka4\n3. R1b4+ Ka3\n4. Rb3+ Ka2\n5. R1b2+ Ka1\n6. Ra3#\n\nThis is a forced checkmate in 6 moves!\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRb6+\n```"
