If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Qxb1 Qxa2\n- Now, Black is up a rook for a pawn, and White's attack is not decisive.\n\n**Calculation for Qxa2:**\n- 1... Qxa2 2. Qe8+ Kh7 3. Qf8+ Kg8 4. Qg7#\n\nSo Qxa2 loses to a forced mate.\n\n**Calculation for Qxg2+:**\n- 1... Qxg2+ 2. Kxg2 b1=Q 3. Qe8#\n\nSo Qxg2+ is bad.\n\n**Calculation for b1=Q:**\n- 1... b1=Q 2. Qxb1 Qxa2\n- White has no immediate checks, and Black is up a rook.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPromoting the pawn to a queen with b1=Q is the best move, as it wins material and avoids any immediate threats.\n\n```\nb1=Q\n```"
