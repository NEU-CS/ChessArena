When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nThe reasoning process should describe how the Assistant analyzes the position and decide on the best move, including: \n- A strategic evaluation of the position. \n- A comparison of key candidate moves. \n- For each candidate, consider the opponent\u2019s likely response and outcome. \n- Conclude with a clear justification for your final choice.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal move:**  \n- c8d8\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n### 1. Material and Position Evaluation\n\n- **Material:**  \n  - Black: Rook (d8), King (e8), Bishop (a3, b2), Pawns (a6, g6, h7)\n  - White: Rook (d1, d7), King (c6), Bishop (c4), Knight (c6), Pawns (b3, e4, f3, h2)\n\n- **King Safety:**  \n  - Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed.\n  - White's king is on c6, very active and centralized.\n\n- **Piece Activity:**  \n  - White's pieces are extremely active and coordinated, especially the rooks on the 7th and 1st ranks, and the knight on c6.\n  - Black's pieces are mostly defensive and passive.\n\n### 2. Candidate Move\n\nThe only legal move for Black is:\n- **c8d8** (move the rook from c8 to d8)\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Move\n\n#### Move: c8d8\n\n- This is a forced move, as it's the only legal move for Black.\n- After this move, White has a very strong continuation:\n  - White can play **d7d8+**, promoting the rook to the 8th rank, forcing a trade or a decisive attack.\n  - Alternatively, White can consider other tactical shots, but d7d8+ is the most direct.\n\n#### Likely Continuation\n\n1. ... c8d8  \n2. Rxd8+ Kxd8  \n3. Bxa6 (or Bxa2, but White is winning regardless)\n\nWhite is completely winning due to material advantage and piece activity.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nSince **c8d8** is the only legal move, it must be played.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nc8d8\n```"
