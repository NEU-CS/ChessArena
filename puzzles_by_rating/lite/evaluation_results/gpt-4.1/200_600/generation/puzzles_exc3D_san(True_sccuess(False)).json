If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Nxf7 Kxf7 (if ...Rh7, then Nxh6 wins material)\n- 2. f5 (threatening fxe6 and f6)\n- If ...exf5, then gxf5, opening the g-file.\n- If ...Nxf5, then gxf5, again opening the g-file.\n\n**Alternative: Nxe6**\n- 1. Nxe6 fxe6 (forced)\n- 2. f5 (threatening f6)\n- But Black can play ...Nf8 or ...exf5.\n\n**Alternative: Qxd5**\n- 1. Qxd5 exd5\n- 2. Nxd5, but then ...Qxc2+ is possible.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **Nxf7** is the most forcing, attacking the rook and threatening a fork on d6. If Black takes with the king, White can play f5, opening lines. If Black plays ...Rh7, then Nxh6 wins material.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nNxf7\n```"
