When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's pieces are active, especially the rook on c4 and bishop on f4.\n\nTactics:  \n- Black threatens ...Rc1+ in some lines, but White's king is relatively safe for now.\n- White can consider d6, pushing the passed pawn.\n- White can also consider Nf5, attacking the bishop and e7 square.\n- Rook moves like Rd4 or Rf3 could double on the f-file or support the d-pawn.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. d6: Pushes the passed pawn, threatens d7, but after ...Rd8, the pawn is blockaded.\n2. Nf5: Attacks the bishop, threatens Ne7+ ideas, and supports d6.\n3. Rf3: Doubles on the f-file, but not immediately threatening.\n4. cxb4: Captures a pawn, but opens the a-file for Black's a-pawn.\n5. Rd4: Prepares to double rooks or support d6.\n\nLet's calculate Nf5:\n- Nf5 Bxg3 (if ...gxf5, then Rg1+ and White can attack)\n- Nxg3 exf4\n- d6, and White has a strong passed pawn.\n\nAlternatively, d6:\n- d6 Rd8 (only move)\n- fxe5, and White threatens Ne4, but Black can play Bxg3.\n\nAlternatively, cxb4:\n- cxb4 Rxb4, and Black's rook is active.\n\nI think Nf5 is the most aggressive, attacking the bishop and threatening Ne7+ ideas. If Black exchanges on g3, White's pawn structure is improved, and the d-pawn can advance.\n\nTherefore, my move is:\n```\nNf5\n```"
