When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Rc4+**\n- Black's king has to move. Let's see the options:\n    - Kb5: then Rxd5 wins the bishop.\n    - Ka5: then Ra3# is mate.\n    - Ka4: then Ra3+ is mate.\n    - Kxc4: not possible, rook is protected by the knight.\n\n**2. a3+**\n- Black's king must move:\n    - Kxa3: not possible, pawn is protected by the rook.\n    - Kc4: not possible, pawn is protected by the rook.\n    - Kb5: then Rxd5 wins the bishop.\n\n**3. Rxd5**\n- Captures the bishop, but does not give check.\n\n**4. Rc5+**\n- Black's king moves:\n    - Kxc5: not possible, rook is protected by the knight.\n    - Ka4: then Ra3# is mate.\n\n**5. Rd4+**\n- Black's king moves:\n    - Kc5: not possible, rook is protected by the knight.\n    - Ka5: then Ra3# is mate.\n\n**6. Ra3+**\n- Black's king moves:\n    - Kxa3: not possible, rook is protected by the rook.\n    - Kc4: not possible, rook is protected by the knight.\n\n**Let's check Rc4+ in detail:**\n- Rc4+ Kb5 (only move)\n- Now Rxd5 wins the bishop.\n\nBut let's check if there is a forced mate:\n\n**Rc4+ Ka5**\n- Ra3# is checkmate.\n\n**Rc4+ Ka4**\n- Ra3+ is checkmate.\n\nSo, Rc4+ is a very strong move, possibly leading to mate.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nRc4+\n```"
