If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Kb3 \u2014 Move the king closer to support the pawn's advance.\n3. Ka3 \u2014 Stay on the a-file, but doesn't help much.\n4. Kb2, Kb1, Ka1 \u2014 All these king moves don't help Black's plan.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- If Black plays a5, White's king is too far to stop the pawn. White can try to push e5, but Black's pawn is faster.\n- If Black moves the king, it wastes time and allows White to push e5 and get closer to queening.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- 1... a5 2. e5 a4 3. e6 a3 4. e7 a2 5. e8=Q a1=Q\n\nBoth sides queen, but Black queens first and can use checks to win the White queen or force mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to push the a-pawn immediately.\n\n```\na5\n```"
