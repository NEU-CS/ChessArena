When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:**  \na8e8, c5f8\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n- **Material:**  \n  Black: Rook (a8), Rook (c5), Queen (f6), pawns  \n  White: Rook (e7), Rook (e2), Bishop (h6), pawns\n\n- **White threats:**  \n  White's rook on e7 is very active, and the bishop on h6 is eyeing the g7 square. White is threatening mate with Re8+.\n\n- **Black's king safety:**  \n  The Black king on g8 is exposed, especially with the bishop on h6 and the rook on e7. If White plays Re8+, Black will be forced to give up material or get mated.\n\n- **Legal moves:**  \n  1. a8e8 (Rook from a8 to e8)  \n  2. c5f8 (Rook from c5 to f8)\n\nLet's analyze both moves:\n\n---\n\n### 1. a8e8\n\n- This move blocks the e-file, preventing Re8+ from White.\n- However, after a8e8, White can play Rxe8+ (rook captures rook), and after Qxe8, White can play Rxe8# (rook captures queen, checkmate).\n- So, a8e8 loses immediately to Rxe8+ Qxe8 Rxe8#.\n\n---\n\n### 2. c5f8\n\n- This move brings the rook back to defend the back rank, specifically the f8 square.\n- Now, if White plays Re8, Black can respond with Rxe8, and after Rxe8#, Black is not mated because the rook is on f8.\n- This move also covers the eighth rank, preventing immediate mate threats.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**a8e8** loses immediately to a forced mate.  \n**c5f8** is the only move that prevents immediate checkmate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc5f8\n```"
