If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

This doesn't threaten anything and may expose the king to back-rank issues or checks.\n2. **Rxf1:** Rook on f6 captures the bishop on f1. This wins a piece, as the rook is not attacked after the capture.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- After Rxf1, White will have two rooks and a bishop vs. rook and bishop, a clear material advantage.\n- There are no immediate threats to the White king.\n- Black's rook on a2 is far from the action and cannot deliver any immediate threats.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRxf1 is the clear best move, winning a piece and maintaining a decisive advantage.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRxf1\n```"
