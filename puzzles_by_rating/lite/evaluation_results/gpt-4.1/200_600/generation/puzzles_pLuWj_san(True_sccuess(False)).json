If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is somewhat exposed, and White's pieces are very active.\n\nTactical ideas:\n- Rxf8+ is a forcing move, as it checks the king and forces ...Kxf8 or ...Rxf8.\n- After Rxf8+ Kxf8, Rc8+ is not possible, but White can try to invade with the other rook or activate the bishop.\n- Be6+ is another forcing move, but Black can block with Kh8 or Rf7.\n- White's bishop is very strong, and Black's king is somewhat exposed.\n\nLet's calculate Rxf8+:\n\n1. Rxf8+ Kxf8 (forced)\n2. Rc8+ (not possible, as the rook is now on f8)\nSo after Rxf8+ Kxf8, White has lost the rook pair, but Black's king is on f8 and White can try to activate the bishop or push pawns.\n\nAlternatively, Be6+:\n\n1. Be6+ Kh8 (forced)\n2. Rxf8+ Rxf8\n3. Rc8 (threatening mate on g8)\nBut after ...Qd1+ or ...Qxe4, Black has counterplay.\n\nAnother idea is to play Rc7, doubling rooks on the 7th rank, but Black's queen is very active.\n\nGiven the forcing nature of Rxf8+, let's check if it leads to a clear advantage:\n\n1. Rxf8+ Kxf8\n2. Rc8+ (not possible)\nSo, after Rxf8+, White loses the rook pair, but Black's king is exposed.\n\nAlternatively, Be6+:\n\n1. Be6+ Kh8\n2. Rxf8+ Rxf8\n3. Rc8 (threatening mate on g8)\nBut Black can defend with ...Qd1+ or ...Qxe4.\n\nLet's check Be6+ in more detail:\n\n1. Be6+ Kh8\n2. Rxf8+ Rxf8\n3. Rc8 Rxc8\n4. Bxc8 Qxe4\n\nThis leads to a queen and bishop vs queen and rook endgame, which is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, play a quiet move like h3 or b4 to improve position, but the forcing moves seem stronger.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the best move is:\n\n```\nRxf8+\n```"
