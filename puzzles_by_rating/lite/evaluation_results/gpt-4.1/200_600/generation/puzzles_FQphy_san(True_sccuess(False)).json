If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

If White plays Qxf2, then Black can play Qxf2+ and after Kxf2, d4 is defended. But after Bxf2+, Kf1 or Kh1 are possible.\n- Qxb3 wins a pawn, but White can play Qe8+ and after Rxe8, Qxe8+ Kh7, Qxf7 and White gets counterplay.\n- Be5 attacks the bishop, but White can play Qxe5.\n\nLet's calculate Bxf2+:\n\n1. ... Bxf2+\n   - 2. Qxf2 Qxf2+ 3. Kxf2 d4, Black is up a piece.\n   - 2. Kf1 (or Kh1) d4, bishop is still strong.\n\nBut after 1...Bxf2+ 2. Qxf2 Qxf2+ 3. Kxf2 d4, Black is up a piece for a pawn.\n\n**Is there any danger to Black after Bxf2+?**\n- No immediate checks or threats from White.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nBxf2+\n```"
