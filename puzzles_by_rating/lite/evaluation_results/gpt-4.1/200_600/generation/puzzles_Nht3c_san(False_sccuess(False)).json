When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black responds with Rxb8, White can recapture with Rxe5, winning a piece.\n- **e4e5**: Attacks the bishop, but the bishop can move to d6 or f6, and White doesn't gain material.\n- **e4d4**: Attacks the rook on d8, but Black can simply move the rook.\n\n**Calculation for b7b8:**\n- If 1. b7b8 Rxb8 2. Rxe5, White wins a piece (rook for rook, then bishop).\n- If 1. b7b8 Bxb8, not possible, as the bishop is on e5.\n- If 1. b7b8, Black cannot defend the bishop on e5 and the rook on d8 at the same time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**b7b8** is the best move, as it wins material by force.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb7b8\n```"
