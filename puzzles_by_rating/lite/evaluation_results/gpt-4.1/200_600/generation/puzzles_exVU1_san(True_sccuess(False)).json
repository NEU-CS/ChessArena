The legal moves are: Kb5, Kd4, Kxd3, Kc3, Kb3, d4\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- The pawn on d5 is blockaded by the knight on d3.\n- The Black king is on c4, close to the knight and pawn.\n- White's king is far away on g2.\n- If Black plays Kxd3, the knight is captured, and Black will have a winning king and pawn vs king endgame.\n- All other king moves allow White to keep the blockade or even capture the pawn in the future.\n\n**Best move:**\n\nKxd3 wins the knight and secures a straightforward win.\n\n```\nKxd3\n```"

If White plays b6, then Kxb5, and Black will win with the extra pawn.\n- **d4:** White ignores and pushes b6, so not optimal.\n\n**Best Move:**  \n**Kc4** is the most direct and best move. It attacks the b5 pawn, and if White pushes b6, Black simply captures it. After that, Black can win with the extra pawn.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nKc4\n```"
