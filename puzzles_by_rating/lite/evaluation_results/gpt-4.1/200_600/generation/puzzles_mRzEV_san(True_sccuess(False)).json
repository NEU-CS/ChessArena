If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Qxf3, then Qxa4, White loses the bishop.\n- If 1. Be3, Qg4 (attacking g2), or Qxb2, but then Rb1 traps the queen.\n- If 1. Bb3, Qxb2, White loses a pawn.\n- If 1. Bd2, Qxb2, White loses a pawn.\n- If 1. exf6, Qxa4, White loses the bishop.\n\n**Thematic idea:**\n- Be3 attacks the queen and covers b2. If Black plays Qxb2, then Rb1 traps the queen (the queen has no escape squares on the b-file). This is a classic queen trap motif.\n\nLet's check this line:\n1. Be3 Qxb2\n2. Rb1 Qc3 (only square)\n3. Bd4 (attacks queen, covers c3, threatens mate ideas)\nBut after Rb1, the queen is trapped.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\nBe3\n```"
