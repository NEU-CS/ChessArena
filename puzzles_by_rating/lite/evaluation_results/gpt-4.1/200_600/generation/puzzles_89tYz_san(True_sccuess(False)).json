When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White's king is very active and close to the pawns, while Black's king is far away.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Kh7: King moves away from the action, not optimal.\n- Kg7: King moves away, not optimal.\n- Kf7: King moves away, not optimal.\n- Kh6: King stays close to pawns, but doesn't advance.\n- Kf6: King centralizes, but doesn't help pawns.\n- Kg5: King supports h5 and g4 pawns, and can escort them.\n- Kf5: King centralizes, but doesn't help pawns.\n- h6: Pushes pawn, but without king support, could be premature.\n- g5: Pushes pawn, but king can support.\n\nBest plan: Use the king to escort the pawns, especially the h-pawn, to promotion. The Black king is too far to stop the pawns, and the b3 pawn is not dangerous yet.\n\nBetween Kg5 and h6:\n- Kg5 keeps the king close to both pawns and allows for support of h6 or g5 pushes.\n- h6 immediately pushes, but it's better to keep the king close for support.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nKg5\n```"
