When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nThe reasoning process should describe how the Assistant analyzes the position and decide on the best move, including: \n- A strategic evaluation of the position. \n- A comparison of key candidate moves. \n- For each candidate, consider the opponent\u2019s likely response and outcome. \n- Conclude with a clear justification for your final choice.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:** 8/8/8/1K5p/1P4k1/8/8/8 w - - 1 52  \n**White to move.**\n\n**Material:**  \n- White: King on b5, pawn on b4  \n- Black: King on g4, pawn on h5\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**  \n- Both sides have a passed pawn.  \n- White's king is much closer to the queenside pawn and can help it promote.  \n- Black's king is far from the queenside and only close to their own pawn, but the White king is much closer to the action.  \n- White's goal: Promote the b-pawn or win Black's h-pawn.  \n- Black's goal: Try to promote the h-pawn or create counterplay.\n\n**Legal Moves:**  \nb5c6, b5b6, b5a6, b5c5, b5a5, b5c4, b5a4\n\nLet's consider each candidate:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **b5c6** (King to c6)\n\n- **Plan:** Move toward supporting the b-pawn's advance.\n- **If Black plays h4:** White can play b5, and the king is close to supporting the pawn's promotion.\n- **If Black plays Kf5:** White can play b5-b6 and then b7, with the king supporting.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **b5b6** (King to b6)\n\n- **Plan:** Directly support the b-pawn.\n- **If Black plays h4:** White can play b5-b5, then b6-b7, and the king is on the promotion square.\n- **If Black plays Kf5:** White can play b5-b7, and the king is supporting.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **b5a6** (King to a6)\n\n- **Plan:** King moves away from the pawn, less optimal.\n- **If Black plays h4:** White can play b5, but the king is less central.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **b5c5** (King to c5)\n\n- **Plan:** King stays central, but not as close to the pawn.\n- **If Black plays h4:** White can play b5, but king is not as close as on b6 or c6.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **b5a5** (King to a5)\n\n- **Plan:** King moves away from the pawn, less optimal.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **b5c4** (King to c4)\n\n- **Plan:** King moves away from the pawn, less optimal.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **b5a4** (King to a4)\n\n- **Plan:** King moves away from the pawn, less optimal.\n\n---\n\n**Comparison of Best Candidates:**\n\nThe best moves are **b5c6** and **b5b6**, as they keep the king close to the pawn and support its advance.\n\n- **b5b6**: The king is directly supporting the pawn and can escort it to promotion. If Black pushes h4, White can play b5-b7, and the king is on the promotion square.\n- **b5c6**: The king is also supporting the pawn, but b6 is more direct.\n\n**Let's check the main line after b5b6:**\n\n1. b5b6 h4  \n2. b4b5 h3  \n3. b5b7 h2  \n4. b7b8Q h1Q  \n5. b8h8 (White queen can stop the pawn, but Black queens as well)\n\nBut after 1. b5b6, if Black tries to run with the pawn, White is always in time to promote and can use the king to shield the pawn.\n\n**Key Point:**  \nAfter **b5b6**, White's king is perfectly placed to support the pawn, and Black's king is too far to help. White will queen first and win.\n\n**Final Decision:**  \n**b5b6** is the most direct and effective move.\n\n```\nb5b6\n```"
