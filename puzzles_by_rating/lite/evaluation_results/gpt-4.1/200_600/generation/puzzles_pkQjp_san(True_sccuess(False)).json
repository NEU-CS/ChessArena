Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

The only way to avoid immediate mate is to try a pawn move, but none of them prevent White's threats. However, let's check if any pawn move can delay mate.\n\n- **h5**: After h5, White can play Qxe8+ Rxe8 Rd8, and Black loses the rook and the game.\n- **a5**: After a5, White can play Qxe8+ Rxe8 Rd8, same as above.\n- **c4**: After c4, White can play Qxe8+ Rxe8 Rd8, same as above.\n\n**Is there any move that avoids immediate loss?**\nNo. All moves lose immediately, but among the pawn moves, **h5** at least creates luft for the king and doesn't immediately lose to mate, but White will still win easily.\n\n**Best try:**  \nPlay **h5** to create luft and hope for a blunder, but the position is lost.\n\n```\nh5\n```"
