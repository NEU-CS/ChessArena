If ...hxg6, then Qxg6# is mate. If ...Kf7, then Ne5+ is strong.\n2. **Qxg6+**: Queen captures pawn with check. If ...hxg6, then Ne6+ forks king and queen.\n3. **Ne6+**: Knight check, forking king and queen. If ...Bxe6, then Qxg6+ wins.\n4. **Nh5+**: Knight check, but doesn't seem as strong as Nxg6 or Ne6+.\n\nLet's calculate **Nxg6**:\n\n- 1. Nxg6 hxg6 (forced)\n- 2. Qxg6# (checkmate)\n\nSo **Nxg6** is a forced mate in two.\n\nLet's check **Qxg6+**:\n\n- 1. Qxg6+ hxg6 (forced)\n- 2. Ne6+ Kf7 (forced)\n- 3. Nxc7 (winning material, but not immediate mate)\n\nSo **Nxg6** is the fastest win.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nNxg6\n```"
