If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Rxg7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n- 2. Qd2 (threatening Qxh6+ and mate on h7)\n- If Black plays ...Rh8, then Qf4 (threatening Qf6+ and Qg7#).\n- Black is in big trouble after Rxg7+.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **Rxg7+** is a powerful forcing move that opens Black's king and gives White a strong attack. There are no immediate defensive resources for Black that can stop White's threats.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRxg7+\n```"
