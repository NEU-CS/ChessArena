When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nThe reasoning process should describe how the Assistant analyzes the position and decide on the best move, including: \n- A strategic evaluation of the position. \n- A comparison of key candidate moves. \n- For each candidate, consider the opponent\u2019s likely response and outcome. \n- Conclude with a clear justification for your final choice.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Board Setup and Material Count**\n- White: King on h1, Queen on d1, Rooks on a1 and e5, Knight on a3 and g3, Pawns on a4, c2, f3, g2.\n- Black: King on g8, Queen on d8, Rook on c8, Rook on h2, Bishop on c5, Knight on b4, Pawns on a6, b7, e6, h7.\n\n**2. White to move. Only legal move: h1h2.**\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Position**\n- White's king is on h1, and Black has a rook on h2, threatening mate on h2 if the king moves.\n- The only legal move for White is to move the king from h1 to h2.\n\n**4. Candidate Moves**\n- The only legal move is h1h2.\n\n**5. Opponent's Likely Response**\n- After 22. Kh2, Black can continue with Qh4+, which is a check, or consider other attacking moves. White is in a precarious position, but for this move, there is no alternative.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n- Since h1h2 is the only legal move, it must be played.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nh1h2\n```"
