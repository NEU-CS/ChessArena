When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If Black responds with dxe4, then Nxe4, Nxe4, Bxf3, dxe4, White has a strong center and the bishop pair. If Black doesn't take, White can play e5 next, gaining space and attacking the knight.\n- **Qd2** is a useful move, connecting rooks and preparing to recapture on f3 with the queen if needed.\n- **Bxf3** is premature unless we have a clear follow-up.\n\n**Best move:**\nI believe the most principled move is **e4**, striking in the center and opening lines for our pieces. This move challenges Black's central control and can lead to a strong initiative.\n\n```\ne4\n```"
