When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If the knight moves, White can play Bd6, attacking the rook and threatening to invade.\n- Ra7 immediately attacks the a7 pawn, but Black can defend with Rc8 or Rxa7.\n- Bishop moves don't seem to create immediate threats unless coordinated with pawn advances.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- e5 Nxe5? Bd6 wins the rook.\n- e5 Nf4 (attacking g2) but White can respond with Be3 or Bd6.\n- e5 Nxe5 is not possible because the knight is on g6, not e5.\n\n**Best move:**\n- e5 is the most aggressive, gaining space, attacking the knight, and opening lines for the bishop and rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5\n```"
