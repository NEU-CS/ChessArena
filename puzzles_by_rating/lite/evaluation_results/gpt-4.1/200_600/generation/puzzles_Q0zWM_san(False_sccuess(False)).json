When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nThe reasoning process should describe how the Assistant analyzes the position and decide on the best move, including: \n- A strategic evaluation of the position. \n- A comparison of key candidate moves. \n- For each candidate, consider the opponent\u2019s likely response and outcome. \n- Conclude with a clear justification for your final choice.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:** 8/8/8/1R3pk1/4p3/4P1P1/6K1/3n4 w - - 0 58  \n**White to move.**\n\n**Material:**\n- White: Rook (b5), King (g2), Pawns (e3, g3)\n- Black: King (g5), Knight (d1), Pawn (e4)\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n- White is up a rook for a knight and pawn, a decisive material advantage.\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g5.\n- Black's knight is on d1, far from the action and not threatening immediate tactics.\n- White's rook is active on b5, and White's king is safe on g2.\n- White's pawns (e3, g3) are solid; Black's only pawn is e4.\n\n**Immediate Threats:**\n- Black has no immediate threats. The knight on d1 is far from White's king and pawns.\n- White can consider advancing pawns, activating the king, or using the rook to cut off the Black king and go for mate.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\nLet's consider the legal moves:\n\n1. **b5b8, b5b7, b5b6**: Rook moves up the b-file. These don't threaten anything immediately.\n2. **b5f5**: Rook to f5, checking the Black king.\n3. **b5e5**: Rook to e5, attacking the e4 pawn and possibly threatening to win it.\n4. **b5d5, b5c5, b5a5**: Rook moves along the 5th rank. Not immediately threatening.\n5. **b5b4, b5b3, b5b2, b5b1**: Rook moves down the b-file. Not useful.\n6. **g2h3, g2h2, g2h1, g2g1, g2f1**: King moves. No immediate threats or gains.\n7. **g3g4**: Pawn advances, but Black can capture with the king (g4xg4).\n\nLet's analyze the most promising moves:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate 1: **b5f5** (Rook to f5, check)\n\n- **After b5f5+**:\n    - Black king must move. Only legal squares: h6, g6, g4, f6.\n    - Let's check each:\n        - **Kg6**: Rook can go to f4, cutting off the king further.\n        - **Kh6**: Rook can go to f4, again cutting off.\n        - **Kg4**: King is more exposed, but White can play Rf4+ and force the king back.\n        - **Kf6**: Rook can go to f4, cutting off the king.\n\n- This move forces the Black king further to the edge and starts the process of checkmating.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate 2: **b5e5** (Rook to e5, attacking e4 pawn)\n\n- **After b5e5**:\n    - Threatens to capture the e4 pawn.\n    - Black can try to defend with Nc3 or move the king.\n    - However, this is slower than giving check and pushing the king to the edge.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate 3: **g3g4** (Pawn push)\n\n- **After g3g4**:\n    - Black can capture: Kxg4, which is not good for White, as it gives up a pawn for nothing.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate 4: **King moves**\n\n- None of the king moves are urgent or improve White's position.\n\n---\n\n### Comparison and Conclusion:\n\n- **b5f5+** is the most forcing move. It checks the king, pushes it further to the edge, and starts the process of checkmating. In rook vs. king endgames, the standard technique is to cut off the king and push it to the edge, then deliver mate. Here, the Black king is already close to the edge, and the rook can force it further.\n- **b5e5** is slower and less forcing.\n- **g3g4** loses a pawn for no reason.\n\n**Best Move:**\n```\nb5f5\n```"
