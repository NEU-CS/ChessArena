If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

So Bxc7 is not possible.\n- **Bxf8** Rxf8, then White must be careful about Rf1+ threats.\n- **Rd7** attacks the bishop, but after Rf1+ White is mated.\n\n**Back rank weakness!**\n- White's king is on h1 with no pawn moved, so any Rf1+ is dangerous.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **h3**: This gives the king an escape square and avoids any back rank mate. After h3, White can safely consider capturing on f8 or c7 next move.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nh3\n```"
