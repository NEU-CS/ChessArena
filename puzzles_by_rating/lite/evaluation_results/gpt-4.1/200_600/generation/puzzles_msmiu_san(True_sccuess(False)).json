If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

If Black plays Kxe8, White can play h6, threatening h7 and g6. If Black plays Nd2+, White can play Ke2 and the knight is still awkward.\n\n**Best move:**  \n**Be8** attacks the e6 pawn and restricts Black's knight. It also keeps the bishop active and prepares to win material.\n\n```\nBe8\n```"
