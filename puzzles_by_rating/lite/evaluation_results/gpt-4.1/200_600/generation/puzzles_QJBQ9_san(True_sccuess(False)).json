Black's king is a bit exposed.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- Rxb7+ (check, attacks b7 pawn, forces Kc8 or Kd8)\n- Rc6+ (check, forces Kb8 or Kd8)\n- Rxe6 (captures e6 pawn, attacks bishop, but loses rook to Bxe6)\n- Rd7+ (check, forces Kc8 or Kb8)\n- Nf6 (threatens mate on d7, but can be captured by Bxf6)\n- Bh6 (attacks g7, but not forcing)\n- Other rook moves\n\n**Checks:**\n- Rxb7+ (forces king move)\n- Rc6+ (forces king move)\n- Rd7+ (forces king move)\n\nLet's calculate the checks:\n\n1. **Rxb7+**\n   - If Kc8, then Nd6+ is a fork (king and rook), but after Bxd6, Rxd6, cxd6, White is up a rook for two pieces.\n   - If Kd8, then Rd7+ is strong.\n\n2. **Rc6+**\n   - If Kb8, then Rxc4 wins an exchange.\n   - If Kd8, then Rd7+.\n\n3. **Rd7+**\n   - If Kc8, then Rc6+.\n   - If Kb8, then Rxc4.\n\nBut **Rxb7+** is the most forcing, and after Kc8, Nd6+ is a fork.\n\nLet's check that line:\n- Rxb7+ Kc8\n- Nd6+ Bxd6 (forced)\n- Rxd6 cxd6\n\nNow, White has two rooks vs rook and bishop, but Black's king is exposed and White can play Rc6+ next, picking up the c4 rook.\n\nAlternatively, after Rxb7+ Kc8, if Black plays Kd8, then Rd7+ is crushing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRxb7+ is the strongest move, winning material and exposing Black's king.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRxb7+\n```"
