Kxb2 (illegal, bishop covers b2)\n- 59...b2 60. Rb7xb2 Bxb2+ 61. Kxb2 (illegal, bishop covers b2)\n- 59...b2 60. Rb7xb2 Bxb2+ 61. Kxb2 (illegal, bishop covers b2)\n- 59...b2 60. Rb7 (stays on 7th rank) b1=Q 61. Rb1 Qxb1 62. Kd2 (White king approaches, but Black is up a queen and bishop for a rook and should win easily)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPushing the b-pawn is decisive. White cannot stop promotion without losing the rook for the pawn, after which Black will be up a bishop in a winning endgame.\n\n**Best move:**\n```\nb2\n```"
