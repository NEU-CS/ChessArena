When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \nr1b1r1k1/1p3npp/2p1pq2/p4p2/P2P2NP/B1P1P3/2Q2PP1/1B3RK1 b - - 2 21\n\n**Black to move.**\n\n### 1. **Material Count**\n- Black: Rooks (a8, e8), Queen (f6), Bishops (c8), Knight (f7), Pawns (a5, b7, c6, e6, f5, g7, h7), King (g8)\n- White: Rook (f1), Queen (c2), Bishops (a3, b1), Knight (g4), Pawns (a4, c3, d4, e3, f2, g2, h2), King (g1)\n\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a space advantage and active pieces.\n\n### 2. **King Safety**\n- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed due to the open f-file and White's active pieces.\n- White's king is on g1, relatively safe.\n\n### 3. **Piece Activity**\n- White's knight on g4 is very active, eyeing f6 and h6.\n- White's bishops are well-placed, especially the one on a3, pressuring f8 and e7.\n- Black's queen on f6 is centralized, but could be vulnerable.\n- Black's knight on f7 is defending, but not very active.\n\n### 4. **Threats**\n- White may be threatening to play Nxf6+ or Nge5, attacking the queen and creating tactical threats.\n- White's queen and rook are eyeing the kingside.\n- Black must be careful about tactics on the f-file and the kingside.\n\n### 5. **Candidate Moves**\nLet's look at the legal moves and see which ones are most promising or necessary:\n\n#### a. **Defensive Moves**\n- **f6g5**: Queen to g5, attacks the knight on g4 and covers the kingside.\n- **f6e7**: Queen to e7, centralizes and defends.\n- **f7g5**: Knight takes on g5, but the knight is not attacking anything there.\n- **h7h6**: Kicks the knight, but after Nxf6+ Qxf6, White may have pressure.\n- **g7g6**: Creates luft for the king, but weakens dark squares.\n\n#### b. **Active Moves**\n- **f5g4**: Pawn takes knight, but after Bxf8, White wins the exchange.\n- **e6e5**: Opens the center, but may be risky with the king exposed.\n- **c8d7**: Develops the bishop, connects rooks.\n- **a8b8**: Rook to b8, but not very relevant.\n\n#### c. **King Moves**\n- **g8h8**: King to h8, sidesteps potential checks on the g-file.\n- **e8f8**: Rook to f8, but f-file is contested.\n\n### 6. **Tactical Considerations**\n- If Black plays **f5g4**, White can play Bxf8, winning the exchange.\n- If Black plays **h7h6**, White can play Nxf6+ Qxf6, then Bxf8, again winning the exchange.\n- If Black plays **f6g5**, the queen attacks the knight and covers the kingside, but White can play Nxf6+ Qxf6, Bxf8, and White wins the exchange.\n\n### 7. **Best Defensive Resource**\n- **c8d7**: Developing the bishop, connecting the rooks, and defending the f5 pawn. This also prepares to bring the rook to d8, contesting the d-file. It does not weaken the kingside and keeps the position solid.\n\n### 8. **Final Evaluation**\n- **c8d7** is the safest and most solid move, defending f5, connecting the rooks, and not weakening the kingside. Other moves either lose material or weaken the king's position.\n\n## **Final Move**\n```\nc8d7\n```"
