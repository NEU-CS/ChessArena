Qxf7+ Kd8 (if Kd7, Qd7#)\n2. Nxe7 (forking king and queen, but Black can play Qe8 or Qd7)\nBut after Qxf7+, if Kd8, then Nxe7, and if Qe8, Qxe8+ Rxe8, Nxc6+ Bxc6, Nxc5, White is up material.\n\n**Let's check Nxh8:**\n1. Nxh8 Qxa4 (threatening mate on g2)\n2. Qxf7+ Kd8 (if Kd7, Qd7#)\n3. Qxe7+ Kc8\n4. Nf7 (threatening mate on d8)\nBut after Nxh8, Black gets counterplay with Qxa4 and threats on g2.\n\n**Let's check Nxe7:**\n1. Nxe7 Qxe4 (threatening mate on g2)\n2. Qg5 (defending g2)\nBut Black is still active.\n\n**Best move: Qxf7+**\n- It's a forcing move, and if Kd7, Qd7# is mate.\n- If Kd8, then Nxe7, and White is winning.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxf7+\n```"
