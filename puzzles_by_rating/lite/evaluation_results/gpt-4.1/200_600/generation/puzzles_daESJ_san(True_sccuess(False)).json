When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Legal moves:** Kf8, Kd8, Rxh5, Qf7\n\nLet's look at the board and the threats:\n\n- White's queen is on h5, threatening Qxh8+.\n- Black's king is on e8, and the only legal moves are with the king, rook, or queen.\n- The knight on e5 is strong, and White has a lot of pressure.\n- If Black plays Rxh5, then White can play Qxh8+ and after Rxh8, Rxg8# is mate.\n- If Black plays Kf8, White can play Qxh8+ and after Qg8, Rxg8# is mate.\n- If Black plays Kd8, White can play Nf7+ and after Bxf7, Qxf7, and Black is getting mated.\n- If Black plays Qf7, White can play Qxf7+ Kd8 (forced), and then Nxf7+ Ke8, and White is winning.\n\nLet\u2019s check each move:\n\n1. **Kf8:** Qxh8+ Qg8 Rxg8# (mate)\n2. **Kd8:** Nf7+ Bxf7 Qxf7 and Black is lost.\n3. **Rxh5:** Qxh8+ Rxh8 Rxg8# (mate)\n4. **Qf7:** Qxf7+ Kd8 Nxf7+ Ke8 Nxh8 and White is up a rook and still attacking.\n\nAll moves lose, but let's see if any prolong the game or offer any hope.\n\n- **Qf7** at least trades queens and avoids immediate mate, though Black is lost.\n- **Kd8** allows a knight check.\n- **Kf8** is immediate mate.\n- **Rxh5** is immediate mate.\n\nSo, the move that prolongs the game the most is **Qf7**.\n\n```\nQf7\n```"
