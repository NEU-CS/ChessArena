If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

After Bxf3, Nxf3, White can consider doubling rooks on the c-file, or playing b4 to expand on the queenside.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBxf3\n```"
