Let's check:\n\n- After Re1, Black's queen is attacked. If Black plays Qxd5, White plays Qg7+ (Kf5), then Qg5# is not possible.\n- If Black plays Qxe1+, White plays Rxe1, and then Black can play Kxf6, but White is still up material.\n\nBetween the two, **Re1** is more active, attacking the queen and keeping the initiative.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nRe1\n```"
