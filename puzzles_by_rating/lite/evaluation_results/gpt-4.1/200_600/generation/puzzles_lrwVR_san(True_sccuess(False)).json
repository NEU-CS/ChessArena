When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's rooks are centralized and active, especially on the e-file and 5th rank. White's rooks are less active, but there is no immediate threat. The pawn structure is symmetrical, but White has a slight space advantage on the queenside with the c3 pawn.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rxe5: Exchanges a pair of rooks, reducing Black's activity.\n- Re4: Defends the c4 square, but doesn't challenge Black's activity.\n- Red1: Doubles rooks on the d-file, but d-file is closed.\n- c4: Undermines Black's d5 pawn, but allows ...dxc4 and Black's rook becomes active.\n- h4: Gains space on the kingside, but doesn't address Black's activity.\n- Kh2: Improves king safety, but not urgent.\n\nRxe5 is the most forcing move, exchanging a pair of rooks and reducing Black's attacking potential. After Rxe5 dxe5, the position is simplified and White can play Rad1, targeting the d5 pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxe5\n```"
