After Rxe5, Black can play Rd1+ (check), but White's king is on g1, so that's not a threat. After Rxe5, Black can play Rd2, but White can defend. Looks like a clean win of a piece.\n2. **Rxf7**: Captures a pawn, but then Black can play Rd1+ and get counterplay.\n3. **Re7**: Doubles on the 7th, but doesn't threaten anything immediately.\n4. **Rb8**: Pins the rook, but doesn't seem to achieve much.\n5. **Other rook moves**: None seem as strong as Rxe5.\n\n**Tactics:**\n- Rxe5 wins a piece for free. The bishop is not defended, and there is no immediate counterplay for Black.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nRxe5\n```"
