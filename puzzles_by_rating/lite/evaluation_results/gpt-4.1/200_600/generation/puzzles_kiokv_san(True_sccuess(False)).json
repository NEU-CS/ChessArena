Qxe5: Captures the knight, but after fxe5, the bishop is still attacked and White's queen is very active.\n2. Qd5: Retreats the queen, defends the bishop, and keeps central control.\n3. Qd1+: Checks the king, but White can block easily.\n4. Qd8: Retreats the queen, but is passive.\n5. Bc6: Moves the bishop, but White can play Nxc6.\n6. Ba6: Moves the bishop, but White can play Qxa5.\n7. Qb6: Defends the bishop and attacks the queen.\n\n**Let's calculate Qb6:**\n- Qb6 attacks the queen on b5 and defends the bishop on b7.\n- If Qxb6, axb6, Black is fine.\n- If Qd7, Qd7, Nxd7, Bxg2+, Kxg2, Rxd7, Black is up a piece.\n\n**Let's check Qb6:**\n- Qb6\n  - If Qxb6, axb6, Black is fine.\n  - If Qe8+, Qf8, Qf7+, Kh8, Qf8+, Qxf8, Nxf8, Black is up material.\n  - If Qd3, Black can play Qf2, threatening mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nQb6 is a strong move, defending the bishop and attacking the queen.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nQb6\n```"
