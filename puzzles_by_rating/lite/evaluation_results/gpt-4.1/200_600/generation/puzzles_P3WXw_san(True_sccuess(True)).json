When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Only legal move is Kf2 (since the king is on g1, and all other squares are covered).\n   - After Kf2, Black can play Nxc3, capturing the rook on c3.\n   - Material after this sequence: White loses a rook and bishop, Black loses two rooks. Let's count:\n     - White: King, rook (b4), bishop (e5), pawns (c2, f4, g2, h2)\n     - Black: King, bishop (a2), knight (e4), pawns (a7, b7, f5, g7, h7)\n     - White is up the exchange (rook for bishop/knight), but Black has a dangerous passed pawn on the queenside and an active knight.\n\n2. **Bf1**\n   - Retreats the bishop, saving it from capture.\n   - Black can play Rxf1+, forcing Kxf1.\n   - Then Black can play Rd1, threatening Rd1-d2 or Rd1-d6.\n   - White keeps both bishops, but loses the exchange (rook for bishop).\n   - Material after this: White has two bishops and a rook, Black has two rooks, bishop, knight.\n   - Black is up the exchange.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- After Bxd1, White wins a rook for a bishop, but Black recaptures with check and wins the rook on c3.\n- After Bf1, White loses the exchange, but keeps both bishops.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n- Bxd1 is forced, as otherwise White simply loses a bishop for nothing.\n- After Bxd1 Rxd1+ Kf2 Nxc3, White can play Rxb7, attacking the a7 pawn and threatening to invade the seventh rank.\n- White's bishop pair can be strong in the endgame, and the rook on b4 is active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bxd1 is the best move, as it wins a rook for a bishop and keeps White in the game with chances.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nBxd1\n```"
