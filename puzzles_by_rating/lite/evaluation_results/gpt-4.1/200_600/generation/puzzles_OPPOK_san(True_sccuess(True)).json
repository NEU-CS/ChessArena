White's rook is active, and the bishop is well-placed.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rh8: Invades the 8th rank, but doesn't threaten immediate mate.\n- Rxf6+: Captures a pawn with check. If ...Kc5, then White can continue to press.\n- Bxc6: Captures a pawn, but loses the bishop to ...Rc1+.\n- Bd5+: Check, but Black can block with Kc5 or Kd6.\n- h4: Prepares to push pawns, but not urgent.\n- b3: Prepares to undermine Black's queenside pawns.\n\nRxf6+ is forcing and wins a pawn with check. Let's look at the line:\n\n1. Rxf6+ Kc5 (if Kd7, then Rxf5)\n2. Rxf5+ Kd4 (if Kb4, then Rf4+)\n3. Rf4+ Kd3 (if Kc4, then Be2+)\n4. Be4+ Kd2 (if Kd4, then Bxc2)\n5. Bxc2 Kxc2\n\nBut after Rxf6+ Kc5, White can play Rxf5+, and the Black king is exposed. White can then try to mop up the pawns and use the rook and bishop to win.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRxf6+\n```"
