If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If ...Rxe8, then Ne7# is mate (since the rook on e8 blocks the king's escape and the knight on f6 can't capture on e7).\n\nLet's check this line:\n1. Qe8+ Nf8 (forced, otherwise Qxf8#)\n2. Qxf8# (mate)\n\nIf 1...Rxe8, then 2. Ne7# is mate (the rook on e8 blocks the king's escape, and the knight on f6 can't capture on e7).\n\nTherefore, **Qe8+** is a forced mate in two.\n\nMy move:\n```\nQe8+\n```"
