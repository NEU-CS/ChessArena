If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If fxe6, then Qh5+ is very strong.\n2. **Nf5**: Attacks the queen and threatens Nxe7+.\n3. **Qxg4**: Wins a piece, but Black gets counterplay.\n4. **Bh6**: Threatens mate, but Black can defend.\n5. **Bf4**: Attacks the queen, but less forcing.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Nxe6**: If fxe6, then Qh5+ g6 Bxg6+ Kd8 Qh8+ Be8 Qxe8# (mate). If Qxe6, then Nxe6 fxe6, White is up a pawn and Black's king is exposed.\n- **Nf5**: If Qe5, then Nxe7 Kxe7, White is better but not as strong as Nxe6.\n- **Qxg4**: Qxh2+ Kf1 Qh1+ Ke2 Qxa1, Black gets some counterplay, but White is up a piece.\n\n**Best Move:**\nNxe6 is the most forcing and gives White a decisive attack.\n\n```\nNxe6\n```"
