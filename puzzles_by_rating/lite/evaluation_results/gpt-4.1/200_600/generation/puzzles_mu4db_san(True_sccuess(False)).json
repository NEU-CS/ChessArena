However, after Rxe6, Rxe6, Rxe6 fxe6, Black is only down a pawn, but with opposite-colored bishops, which may offer drawing chances.\n\nAlternatively, **Qb6** keeps the queen active and avoids the fork, but White can still double on the e-file.\n\n**Let's calculate Qxc6:**\n1. Qxc6 Qxc6\n2. Rxe6 Rxe6\n3. Rxe6 fxe6\n4. Rxe6 Bxc3\n\nBlack gets some counterplay with the bishop.\n\n**Let's check for tactics:**\n- Is there a way to avoid losing material? Not really, since the knight is too strong.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the knight and try to hold the endgame.\n\n```\nQxc6\n```"
