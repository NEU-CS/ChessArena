If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

White's king is relatively safe on f2.\n- Black's king is on c8, not immediately threatened but not very safe either.\n- Black's pieces: Bishop on e7, knight on g8, rook on h8, pawns on b5, b7, f6, g7, h6.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- Rh7: Defends h6, but passive.\n- Kb8: Moves king to a safer square, but doesn't address threats.\n- Ng6: Brings knight into play, attacks h4 and f4, and covers e5.\n- Nc6: Attacks d4 and b4, but White can play c5.\n- Nf5: Attacks d6, but White can play c5.\n- Nd5: Attacks e3 and b4, but White can play c5.\n- Be8: Passive, but covers h5.\n- Bxe6: Captures rook, but after Bxe6+ Kd8, White is still better.\n- Bc6: Attacks d6, but White can play c5.\n- bxc4: Opens b-file, but White's bishop becomes even stronger.\n- g6: Weakens kingside, but may be necessary.\n- f5: Opens up the king, but may be necessary.\n- b4: Pushes pawn, but White can play c5.\n- g5: Pushes pawn, but White can play c5.\n\n**Critical lines:**\n- Bxe6 is interesting: Bxe6+ Kd8 (forced), then White may try c5, but Black can try to hold.\n- Ng6 is the most active move, developing the knight and attacking h4 and f4.\n\n**Let's check Bxe6:**\n1. ... Bxe6\n2. Rxe6+ Kd8\n3. c5 (threatening c6+)\n4. ... f5 (trying to block the bishop)\nBut White is still much better.\n\n**Let's check Ng6:**\n1. ... Ng6\nIf White plays c5, then ... Ne5 attacks d6 and g4.\nIf White plays hxg6, then ... Bxd6.\n\n**Ng6 seems to be the best practical try, developing a piece and creating threats.**\n\nFinal move:\n```\nNg6\n```"
