If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Legal moves:** Qc1, Re1, Bd1\n\nLet's look at the board:\n\n- White: King on g1, Queen on h6, Rook on e5, Bishop on f3, pawns on c2, f2, g2, h2\n- Black: King on g8, Rook on b1, Rook on f8, pawns on a7, c7, f7, g6, h7\n\n**Material:** White is up a queen for a rook (White has Q, R, B vs Black's 2R), and White's queen is very active on h6.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- The queen on h6 is threatening, but not directly attacking anything at the moment.\n- The rook on e5 is centralized.\n- Black's king is relatively safe for now, but White's pieces are active.\n\nLet's analyze the legal moves:\n\n1. **Qc1**: Retreats the queen to c1, possibly to defend the first rank or to reposition. But this seems passive and loses the initiative.\n2. **Re1**: Retreats the rook to e1, defending the first rank, but again, seems passive.\n3. **Bd1**: Retreats the bishop to d1, possibly to defend the first rank, but also passive.\n\n**Why are these the only legal moves?**  \nBecause Black is threatening mate on the first rank: Rook on b1 and rook on f8, so Rfb8# or R1b8# is a threat. The only way to prevent mate is to defend the first rank.\n\n- If White plays Qc1, the queen covers the first rank.\n- If White plays Re1, the rook covers the first rank.\n- If White plays Bd1, the bishop covers the first rank.\n\nLet's check if any of these moves allow White to keep the advantage or avoid immediate loss.\n\n**1. Qc1**\n- After Qc1, Black can play Rxc1+ (rook on b1 takes queen), and after Rxc1, Black can play Re8, and the position is about equal, but White loses the queen for a rook.\n\n**2. Re1**\n- After Re1, Black can play Rxe1+ (rook on b1 takes rook), and after Qxe1, Black can play Re8, and again, White loses the rook for nothing.\n\n**3. Bd1**\n- After Bd1, Black can play Rxd1+, and after Bxd1, Black can play Re8, and again, White loses the bishop for a rook.\n\nBut let's check if any of these moves allow White to keep the queen.\n\nIf White plays Re1, and Black plays Rxe1+, White can play Qxe1, and now the queen is on e1, defending the first rank, and White is up a queen for a rook and bishop.\n\n**Let's check for any tactics:**\n\n- After Re1 Rxe1+ Qxe1, Black has no immediate threats, and White is up material.\n- After Qc1 Rxc1+ Re1, White loses the queen for a rook.\n- After Bd1 Rxd1+ Bxd1, White loses the bishop for a rook.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n\n```\nRe1\n```"
