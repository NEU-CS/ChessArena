If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After ...Kxe7, White can consider Rxc6, winning the bishop.\n2. **Ra8**: Passive, not threatening anything.\n3. **Rxa4**: Captures a pawn, but Rxe7+ is more forcing.\n4. **Rxc6**: Captures the bishop, but then ...Rb1+ is a check, and Black gets counterplay.\n5. **Other rook moves**: Not as forcing as Rxe7+.\n\n**Calculation after Rxe7+:**\n- 1. Rxe7+ Kxe7 (forced)\n- 2. Rxc6 (captures the bishop, threatening Rc1-c7+)\n- If 2...Rb1+ 3. Rc1 (blocking), and White is up a piece.\n\n**Check for tactics:**\n- After 1. Rxe7+ Kxe7 2. Rxc6, Black has no immediate checks except Rb1+.\n- White's king is safe after Rc1.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRxe7+ wins a piece and is the most forcing and best move.\n\n```\nRxe7+\n```"
