Let's check: Qxf6 dxc4 (attacking the bishop), but White can recapture with Bxc4, remaining a piece up.\n2. **Qxd5**: Captures the pawn, but then Nxd5 and White loses the queen for a knight.\n3. **Nxd5**: Captures the pawn, but then Nxd5 Qxd5, and Black can play Be6, trading off pieces.\n4. **Bxd5**: Captures the pawn, but then Nxd5 Qxd5, and again, Black can play Be6.\n5. **Qxa7**: Grabs a pawn, but the queen may be out of play.\n6. **Ba6**: Attacks the rook, but Black can simply move the rook.\n7. **Bb5**: Pins the knight, but Black can play Nc6.\n\n**Tactical check:**\n- **Qxf6**: If Qxf6, Black cannot recapture with g7 pawn, so White wins a piece outright. Let's check for any tactics: Qxf6 dxc4, but White can play Qf4, defending the bishop and keeping the extra piece.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Qxf6** wins a piece cleanly, as the knight on f6 is unprotected and Black cannot recapture.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nQxf6\n```"
