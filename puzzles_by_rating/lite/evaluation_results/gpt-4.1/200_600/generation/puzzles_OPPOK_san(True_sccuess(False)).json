When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is exposed, and White's rook is very active on h6. Black's rook is active on c2, but White has the initiative.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rxf6: Captures a pawn, threatens to invade the 7th rank, but allows Rc1+ with some counterplay.\n- Rh8: Threatens mate on h7, but Black can defend with Rc1+ and then Kd7.\n- Bxc6+: Forces the king to move, but after bxc6, White's rook can invade the 7th rank.\n- Bd5+: Checks the king, but Black can block with Kc5 or Kd6.\n- h4: Prepares to push h5, but is slow.\n\nLet's calculate:\n1. Rxf6+ gxf6 (if ...Kc5, then Rxf5+ and White is winning)\n2. Rxf6+ Kc5 (if ...gxf6, then Bxc6+ bxc6 and White is up a piece)\n3. Rxf5+ Kd4 (if ...Kc4, then Bd5+ wins the rook)\nBut after Rxf6+, Black can play Kc5, and White can continue with Rxf5+ Kd4, Rf7, but Black's king is exposed.\n\nAlternatively, Bxc6+ bxc6, and now White can play Rxf6+ Kc5, Rxf5+ Kd4, Rf7, and White is winning.\n\nBut the most forcing move is Bxc6+, as it forces Black to recapture and opens lines for White's rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBxc6+\n```"
