When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White's rook is on b1, eyeing the b-file. Black's bishop on h4 is active, and the rook on a2 is on the second rank, which can be useful for attacking.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rg2+ is a forcing move, checking the king. If White plays Kf1, then Rf2+ is another check, but White can block with Kg1 again. If White plays Kh1, then Black can continue with Bg3, threatening mate on h2.\n- Bf2+ is another check, forcing White's king to h1, after which Bg3 threatens mate on h2.\n- Ra1 is a quiet move, but doesn't threaten much immediately.\n- a4, pushing the pawn, but not urgent.\n- h5, to support the bishop and possibly play h4.\n- f5, to open the f-file, but it weakens the king.\n\nLet's calculate Rg2+:\n1. ... Rg2+ \n2. Kh1 (if Kf1, then Rf2+ and White can only go back to g1)\n2. ... Bg3 (threatening mate on h2)\nIf White plays Ne3, then ...Re2 and Black is threatening mate again.\n\nAlternatively, Bf2+:\n1. ... Bf2+ \n2. Kh1 (forced)\n2. ... Rg1+ \n3. Rxg1 Bxg1 and Black wins the exchange, but White's knight is still strong.\n\nI believe the most dangerous and forcing is:\n```\nRg2+\n```"
