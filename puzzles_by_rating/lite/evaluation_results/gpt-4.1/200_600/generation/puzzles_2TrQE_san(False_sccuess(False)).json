When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nThe reasoning process should describe how the Assistant analyzes the position and decide on the best move, including: \n- A strategic evaluation of the position. \n- A comparison of key candidate moves. \n- For each candidate, consider the opponent\u2019s likely response and outcome. \n- Conclude with a clear justification for your final choice.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The White king is too far to stop the pawns, so this is a logical move.\n- After a6a5, White's only real plan is to advance the h-pawn (h4-h5-h6), but Black can continue with a5-a4, b5-b4, and so on.\n- However, before pushing pawns, it's often best to centralize the king further to support the advance.\n\n### 2. b4c5 (King to c5)\n- This centralizes the king and supports the b5 pawn, preparing to advance the a-pawn.\n- After Kc5, Black can play a6-a5 next, with the king ready to support both pawns.\n- White's king is too far to interfere.\n\n### 3. b4c4 (King to c4)\n- Similar to Kc5, but less optimal because the king is not supporting the b5 pawn as directly.\n\n### 4. b4a5 (King to a5)\n- Moves the king away from the center and from supporting the b5 pawn. Not optimal.\n\n### 5. b4a4 (King to a4)\n- Moves the king to the edge, not ideal.\n\n### 6. b4c3, b4b3, b4a3\n- These moves move the king away from the pawns and the center, not optimal.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- The best plan is to use the king to support the pawn advance.\n- Kc5 is the most active and flexible move, keeping the king central and supporting both pawns.\n- a6a5 is also good, but Kc5 is more precise, as it keeps all options open and supports both pawns.\n\n**Opponent's likely response:**\n- White will likely try to push h4-h5-h6, but Black's plan is much faster.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **b4c5** (Kc5) is the best move, centralizing the king and supporting the pawn advance.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb4c5\n```"
