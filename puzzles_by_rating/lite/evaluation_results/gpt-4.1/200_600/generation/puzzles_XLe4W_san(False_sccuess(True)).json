When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White recaptures with the queen, Black can play ...Nb4, attacking the queen and the c2 bishop. If White recaptures with the knight, Black can play ...Nb4, again attacking the queen and bishop.\n\n#### **F. c6b4**\n- Immediately attacks the queen and bishop, but the queen can move to d2 or e2, defending the bishop.\n\n#### **G. d8d7**\n- Connects the rooks, but not urgent.\n\n#### **H. a8c8**\n- Brings the rook to the open c-file, but not immediately threatening.\n\n#### **I. h7h6**\n- Kicks the bishop, but White doesn't have a bishop on g5 or h4.\n\n### 5. **Tactical Considerations**\n- The pin on the knight on f3 is significant.\n- If Black plays Bxf3, White must recapture. After that, Black can play ...Nb4, attacking the queen and bishop.\n\n#### Let's calculate:\n**11... Bxf3 12. Qxf3 (if 12. gxf3, White's kingside is weakened) Nb4**\n- Now, the queen is attacked, and so is the bishop on c2.\n- If 13. Bb3, then ...Bxd4 wins a pawn.\n- If 13. Qe2, then ...Nxc2 wins the exchange (rook for knight).\n\nThis looks very promising for Black.\n\n### 6. **Final Evaluation**\n**Bxf3** is a strong move, exploiting the pin and creating tactical threats. After Bxf3, if White plays Qxf3, then Nb4 attacks the queen and bishop, and Black can win material.\n\n### 7. **Best Move**\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng4f3\n```"
