When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Legal moves:** Kf8, Bxf6\n\n**Position Overview:**\n- Black's king is on e8, queenside rook on a8, kingside rook on h8.\n- White has a queen on h5, knight on f6, knight on e2, bishop on c4, and is threatening mate on f7.\n- Black's bishop is on e7, bishop on c8, queen on d8, knight on a5, pawns on a7, b7, c7, d6, e5, h6, f7, g7.\n- White's last move was likely Qh5, threatening mate on f7.\n\n**Threats:**\n- White threatens Qxf7# (mate).\n- The knight on f6 is also a huge problem, supporting the queen and attacking the bishop on e7.\n\n**Legal Moves:**\n1. **Kf8**: Moves the king to f8, but then Qxf7# is still mate, so this is not legal (since it would be mate).\n2. **Bxf6**: Bishop captures the knight on f6, removing the mate threat.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Kf8 is not a legal move because Qxf7# is mate.\n- Bxf6 is forced to avoid immediate mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only move that avoids immediate checkmate is:\n\n```\nBxf6\n```"
