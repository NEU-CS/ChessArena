If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If Black plays ...Nxc5, then Nxc5, and White has a knight on c5, pressuring b7 and e6.\n2. **Nd2**: Retreats the knight, but seems passive.\n3. **Re4**: Rxe4 Nxe4 Rxe4, but then Black can play ...Nc6, regaining the piece.\n4. **Bishop moves**: Developing the bishop (Bg5, Bf4, Be3, Bd2) to connect the rooks and prepare for central play.\n5. **Pawn moves**: c4, f3, h3, etc. c4 attacks the knight on e4, but Black can play ...Nd6 or ...Nc5.\n\n**Best move analysis:**\n- **Nc5** is the most active, attacking the bishop and threatening to jump to e6 or a6. If Black plays ...Nxc5, then Nxc5, and White's knight is well-placed.\n- **Bg5** develops a piece and pins the knight, but Black can play ...Nxg5.\n- **Bf4** develops the bishop, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n- **c4** attacks the knight, but Black can play ...Nd6 or ...Nc5.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Nc5** is the most active and challenging move, putting pressure on Black and improving White's position.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nNc5\n```"
