If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Black can respond with Re8+ or Bxg7.\n2. **Be5**: Centralizes the bishop, but doesn't threaten much.\n3. **Bxc5**: Captures a pawn, but after Bxc5, Black can recapture with the bishop.\n4. **Be3**: Develops, but not very active.\n5. **Nd2/Na3**: Develops the knight, preparing to castle queenside.\n6. **h3**: Kicks the bishop, but Black can play Bh5 or retreat.\n7. **c4**: Gains space and attacks the bishop on g4, but weakens d4.\n8. **f3**: Kicks the bishop, but weakens the king's position.\n\nThe most forcing move is **Bxg7**. After Bxg7, if Black plays Bxg7, White can play Nd2, preparing to castle queenside, and White has won a pawn. If Black plays Re8+, White can block with Be2 or Ne3.\n\nLet's check the consequences of **Bxg7**:\n- Bxg7 Bxg7\n- Nd2 (developing, preparing to castle queenside)\n- White is up a pawn and has a safe king.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBxg7\n```"
