When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Qxa6: Captures a pawn, threatens Qb7+ and Qc8+ ideas, and attacks c6.\n2. Qxc6: Captures a pawn, but after Qxb1+ Rxb1 Rxc6, Black wins material.\n3. Qf8+: Forces Black's king to f6 or d7, but after Kf6, White has no follow-up.\n4. Rxb2: Captures the queen, but after Nf2+ Kg1 Nxh1, Black wins a rook and a pawn for the queen.\n5. Nxg4: Captures the knight, but after Qxb1+ Rxb1 Rxe4, Black is better.\n6. Qb7: Attacks c7, but not as forcing as Qxa6.\n\nLet's check Qxa6:\n- Qxa6 threatens Qb7+ and Qc8+.\n- If Black plays Qxb1+ Rxb1 Rxe4, White is down material.\n- If Black plays Qxb1+ Rxb1 Nf2+ Kg1 Nxh1, Black wins a rook and a pawn for the queen, but White has a dangerous passed a-pawn and active pieces.\n\nLet's check Qf8+:\n- Qf8+ Kf6 (if Kd7, Qxf7+ wins the rook)\n- Qf8+ Kd7 Qxf7+ Kd6 Qf4+ e5 Qxc4, White wins a rook.\n\nSo, Qf8+ looks very strong:\n- Qf8+ Kd7 Qxf7+ Kd6 Qf4+ e5 Qxc4, White is up a rook.\n- Qf8+ Kf6 Qd8+ Kg6 Qg8+ Kf6 Qh8+ Kg6 Qxb2, White wins the queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQf8+\n```"
