When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If White can play Rd8, it would be a big threat. However, currently, the rook is on d1 and can't go to d8 in one move.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Rxe6: Captures the dangerous e6 pawn, but after Rd8, White can win the rook with Rxe8+.\n2. Re7: Defends the e6 pawn, but White can double on the d-file.\n3. Kg8: Moves the king to a safer square, but doesn't address the e6 pawn.\n4. h6, g6, b6, a6, c5, h5, g5, b5, a5: Pawn moves, but none address the immediate threat.\n\nLet's check Rxe6:\n- 26...Rxe6 27. Rd7 (threatening Rxb7 and Rd8)\n- 26...Rxe6 27. Rd8 Kg8 28. Rxe8+ Rxe8\n\nBut after 26...Rxe6 27. Rd8, White threatens Rxe8+ and wins the rook.\n\nWhat about Re7?\n- 26...Re7 27. Rd7 Rxd7 28. exd7 Rd8 (now the pawn is blockaded)\n\nBut after 27. Rd7, White threatens to win the b7 pawn and the d7 pawn is very strong.\n\nWhat about Kg8?\n- 26...Kg8 27. Rd7 Rxe6 28. Rxb7\n\nBut White wins a pawn and keeps pressure.\n\nWhat about Rd8?\n- 26...Rd8 27. Rxd8+ Rxd8 28. e7 Re8 29. Kf2\n\nWhite's pawn is still dangerous, but Black can blockade.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\nRd8\n```\nThis exchanges rooks and blockades the e7 pawn, giving Black the best chance to hold the position."
