Black must address this threat immediately.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- Rxf5 (captures the queen, but White recaptures with the rook, and Black is still in a losing position)\n- Rg8 (defends f8, but White can still play Qf7, threatening mate)\n- Kg8 (moves the king, but White can play Qxf8#)\n- Re8 (blocks the e-file, but doesn't stop Qxf8#)\n- Rf7 (defends f8, but White can play Qxf7, Rxf7, Re8+ and wins)\n- h6, g6, d5, a5, c4, b4, h5, g5 (none of these stop the mate threat)\n\n**Only move to avoid immediate mate:**\n- Rxf5\n\nAfter Rxf5, White can play Re8+ (skewering the king and rook), but it's the only way to avoid mate.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nRxf5\n```"
