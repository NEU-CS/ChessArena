When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nThe reasoning process should describe how the Assistant analyzes the position and decide on the best move, including: \n- A strategic evaluation of the position. \n- A comparison of key candidate moves. \n- For each candidate, consider the opponent\u2019s likely response and outcome. \n- Conclude with a clear justification for your final choice.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \n- f8g8 (King to g8)\n- f8e8 (King to e8)\n\n**Material count:**  \n- Black: King (f8), Rook (a7), Rook (d7), Pawn (b6), Pawn (f7), Pawn (g6)\n- White: King (h2), Queen (h6), Bishop (e6), Pawn (b2), Pawn (f6)\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**  \n- Black is down a queen for a rook and is under severe attack. The White queen and bishop are coordinating against the Black king, and the f6 pawn is a major threat.\n- Black's king is on f8, and the only legal moves are to e8 or g8.\n- White's next move could be Qh8# if the king moves to g8, or Qh8+ followed by Qg7# if the king moves to e8.\n\n**Candidate moves:**  \n1. **f8g8**  \n   - King moves to g8.\n   - White plays Qg7# (checkmate).\n\n2. **f8e8**  \n   - King moves to e8.\n   - White plays Qh8# (checkmate).\n\n**Analysis of both moves:**  \n- Both moves lead to immediate checkmate by White on the next move.  \n- There are no other legal moves for Black.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Both moves lose instantly, but according to the rules, I must select one of the legal moves.  \n- There is no way to avoid checkmate.\n\n**Final move:**  \nI will select the move f8g8 (king to g8), as it is the first in the list.\n\n```\nf8g8\n```"
