Let's check move order:\n\n- After b4b5, if Black plays h3, White plays b5b6, Black plays h2, White plays b6b7, Black plays h1=Q, White plays b7b8=Q.\n\nBut let's check if White can queen before Black:\n\n- b4b5 h3  \n- b5b6 h2  \n- b6b7 h1=Q  \n- b7b8=Q\n\nSo both sides queen, but White's king is much closer to the new queens, and Black's king is far away. White should be able to win the queen endgame due to the active king.\n\n**Alternative:**\n- If White moves the king, Black will push h3 and h2, and White will be forced to stop the pawn, losing the chance to queen the b-pawn.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to push the b-pawn immediately.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb4b5\n```"
