If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Black can try Nxe7, but then Bc5 or Bc7+ is strong.\n- If **Rh7**, White can play dxe7, and after Nxe7, Bc5 is strong.\n- If **Ng6**, White can play dxe7, and after Nxe7, Bc5 is strong.\n- If **bxc4**, White can play dxe7, and after Nxe7, Bc5 is strong.\n\n**Best defense:**\n- The most forcing move is **Bxe6**. After dxe7, Nxe7, White can play Bc5, but at least Black has eliminated the dangerous rook and can try to defend.\n\nLet's calculate:\n1. ... Bxe6\n2. dxe7 Nxe7\n3. Bc5 Nc6 (defending b4)\n4. cxb5 Ne5 (attacking g4)\n5. Be2 Rd8\n\nBlack is still under pressure, but this is the best chance.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nBxe6\n```"
