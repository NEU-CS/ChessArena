When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The bishop on h6 is also a threat, as it pins the f7 pawn and eyes g7.**\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- Qxh5, winning a piece.\n- f6, trapping the bishop on g7.\n- f5-f6, opening lines against Black's king.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. ...Kh8 (g8h8): sidesteps any checks on the g-file, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.\n2. ...Nf6 (h5f6): returns the knight to safety, blocks the queen's attack, and covers e8.\n3. ...Bf6 (e7f6): not possible, as the bishop is on d7.\n4. ...Qf6 (e7f6): not possible, as the queen is on e7.\n5. ...Qh4 (e7h4): attacks the queen, but White can just play Qxh5.\n6. ...g6: not a legal move.\n7. ...f6: not a legal move.\n8. ...Nf4: not a legal move.\n9. ...g5: not a legal move.\n10. ...Bxf5: not a legal move.\n\n**Best move:**\n- The knight on h5 is attacked twice (by the queen and pawn) and defended zero times. It must move.\n- ...Nf6 (h5f6) is the only move that saves the knight and doesn't lose material immediately.\n\n**Let's check for tactics:**\n- After ...Nf6, if Qxg7#, the square is covered by the king.\n- If Qg3, White may try to regroup, but Black is safe for now.\n- If Qh4, White threatens to exchange queens, but Black can respond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only move that doesn't lose material is to retreat the knight.\n\nMy move:\n```\nh5f6\n```"
