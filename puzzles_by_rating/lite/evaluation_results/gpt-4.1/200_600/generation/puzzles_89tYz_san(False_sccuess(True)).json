Let's see if White can win this queen endgame. White's king is on g6, so after queening, White can coordinate with the king to win.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **g4g5** (g4-g5)\n- White pushes the g-pawn.\n- Black plays b3-b2.\n- White can play h5-h6, but Black will queen first.\n- 1. g5 b2\n- 2. h6 b1=Q\n- 3. h7 Qb2-h8=Q\n\nBut Black queens first, which is less ideal.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **g6h7** (Kg6-h7)\n- King moves to h7, supporting the h-pawn.\n- Black plays b3-b2.\n- White plays h5-h6.\n- Black plays b2-b1=Q.\n- White plays h6-h7.\n- Black can check with the queen, but White's king is close to the pawns and can shield.\n\nBut this is slower than just pushing the pawn.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **g6h6** (Kg6-h6)\n- King moves to h6, supporting both pawns.\n- Black plays b3-b2.\n- White plays h5-h6.\n- Black plays b2-b1=Q.\n- White plays h6-h7.\n- Black can check, but White's king is close.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The fastest way to promote is to push the h-pawn immediately with **h5h6**.\n- Black cannot stop the pawn, and White will queen at the same time or just after Black, but with a much more active king.\n- This should be a win for White, as the king is ideally placed to support the new queen and avoid perpetual checks.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nh5h6\n```"

Black's king is on d2, queen on b1.\n\nWhite is winning here because:\n- White's king is safe.\n- White can use the queen and king to force mate.\n- Black's king is far from the queenside and cannot help defend.\n\n### **Move 2: g6h7**\n\n- King moves to h7, supporting the pawn.\n- Black plays b2b1=Q.\n- White can play g4-g5, but Black's queen is already on the board.\n\nThis is slower than h6h7.\n\n### **Move 3: g4g5**\n\n- Pushes the g-pawn, but doesn't threaten promotion.\n- Black will promote b2-b1=Q.\n- White is not threatening immediate promotion.\n\nThis is less effective than h6h7.\n\n## 4. **Conclusion**\n\n**h6h7** is the best move. It immediately threatens to promote, and Black cannot stop it. Even if Black promotes first, White will have a queen with a king close to the action, which is a decisive advantage.\n\n## 5. **Final Move**\n\n```\nh6h7\n```"
