Rxd5+ Nxd5 (forced)\n2. Rxd5 (if White takes with the knight, Black can try to get some play with Rd8, but White is up a piece)\n\nAlternatively, **Qxc5**:\n1. Qxc5 bxc5\n2. bxc5 (White is up a piece)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll lines are bad for Black, but **Rxd5+** at least forces a queen trade and gives Black some practical chances to defend.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n```\nRxd5+\n```"
