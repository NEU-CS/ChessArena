If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Qf5+ (forces ...Kg8, then maybe Rd3 or Rd7)\n2. Qg7+ (forces ...Kxg7, then Rd7, but King escapes)\n3. Qg6+ (forces ...fxg6, but no immediate mate)\n4. Rd7 (threatening Rxb7, but Black can defend)\n5. Nc8 (attacking b6, but not urgent)\n6. Qd7 (threatening Qxb7, but Black can defend)\n\nLet's calculate Qf5+:\n\n1. Qf5+ Kg8 (only move)\n2. Qg4+ Kh7 (back)\n3. Qf5+ Kg8\n\nThis is a repetition.\n\nWhat about Qg7+?\n\n1. Qg7+ Kxg7\n2. Rd7 (threatening Rxb7 and Rxf7)\n   - If ...Bc8, then Rc7, but Black can defend.\n   - If ...Re7, then Rxe7, Kf6, but White is up material.\n\nWhat about Qg6+?\n\n1. Qg6+ fxg6\n2. Rd7+ Kg8 (only move)\n3. Rxb7 (threatening Rdd7, but Black can defend with Rf7)\n\nWhat about Rd7?\n\n1. Rd7 (threatening Rxb7)\n   - If ...Bc8, then Rc7, but Black can defend.\n   - If ...Re7, then Rxe7, Rxe7, Qb4, but Black is still holding.\n\nWhat about Qd7?\n\n1. Qd7 (threatening Qxb7)\n   - If ...Re7, then Qxe7, Rxe7, Nc6, White is better.\n\nBut let's look for a forced win.\n\n**Best move: Qg7+**\n\n1. Qg7+ Kxg7\n2. Rd7 (threatening Rxb7 and Rxf7)\n   - If ...Bc8, then Rc7, and White will win the Bishop.\n   - If ...Re7, then Rxe7, Rxe7, Nc6, White is up a piece.\n\nThis seems to be the most forcing and winning continuation.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQg7+\n```"
