If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

The knight on h5 is also under attack by the queen.\n- Black's king is on g8, with pawns on g7 and h7. The knight on h5 is attacked by the queen.\n- White's last move was likely Qg4, threatening Qxg7# or Qxh5.\n- Black's queen is on d7, bishop on e7, rook on f8 and a8, pawns on c6, d6, e5, f7, g7, h7, a7, b7.\n- The bishop on h6 is very dangerous.\n\nImmediate threats:\n- Qxh5 is a free knight.\n- Qxg7# is mate if the bishop on h6 is not blocked.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. ... Bf6: Blocks the g7 square, defends against Qxg7#, and covers the knight on h5.\n2. ... Kh8: Moves the king, but does not address the threat to the knight.\n3. ... Nf6: Retreats the knight, but then Qxg7# is mate.\n4. ... Qe8: Defends g7, but the knight is still hanging.\n5. ... Qd8: Same as above.\n6. ... Qc8: Same as above.\n\nBf6 is the only move that both defends against mate and saves the knight.\n\nLet's check for tactics:\n- After ...Bf6, if Qxh5, then gxh6, and Black is safe.\n- If White tries to break through, there is no immediate mate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nBf6\n```"
