If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Legal moves:** Bf1, Bxd1\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n- Black's last move was ...Rd8-d1, attacking the bishop on e1 and threatening mate on f1.\n- White's only legal moves are Bf1 (blocking the mate) and Bxd1 (capturing the rook).\n- If 1. Bxd1, Black will play Rxd1+, and after Kf2, Black has Ba1, but White is down material and under heavy attack.\n- If 1. Bf1, White blocks the mate, but Black can still try to press with moves like Nxc3 or Bc4.\n\nLet's check both moves:\n\n**1. Bxd1**\n- 1... Rxd1+ 2. Kf2 (forced) Ba1 (threatening mate on f1) and White is lost.\n\n**1. Bf1**\n- This blocks the mate threat and keeps the game going, though White is still in a tough spot.\n\nTherefore, the only move to avoid immediate mate is:\n\n```\nBf1\n```"
