When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n3r1rk1/5p1p/2b3p1/2q5/8/6R1/1Q4PP/2R4K w - - 0 33\n\n**White to move.**\n\n### 1. **Material and Piece Activity**\n- **Material:** Material is equal.\n- **White's pieces:**\n  - Queen on b2, rook on c1, rook on g3, king on h1, pawns on h2, g2.\n- **Black's pieces:**\n  - Queen on c5, rook on d8, rook on f8, bishop on c6, pawns on f7, g6, h7.\n\n### 2. **King Safety**\n- Both kings are relatively safe, but White's king is slightly exposed on h1, though there are no immediate threats.\n\n### 3. **Tactical Motifs**\nLet's look for tactical opportunities, especially with the queen and rook battery.\n\n#### **Candidate Moves**\n- **g3g6:** Attacks the bishop on c6 and threatens g6xg7+ if the f-pawn moves.\n- **b2h8:** Queen to h8, threatening mate on g7 if the rook moves.\n- **b2g7:** Queen to g7, but this is not possible as the square is protected by Black's rook on f8.\n- **c1c5:** Rook takes queen, but the queen is not on c5.\n- **b2b8:** Queen to b8, attacking the rook on f8 and bishop on c6.\n- **g3g5:** Rook to g5, attacking the f5 square.\n- **g3h3:** Rook to h3, possibly preparing to swing to the h-file.\n\n#### **Tactical Checks**\n- **g3g6:** This move attacks the bishop on c6 and threatens to double up on the g-file. If Black plays fxg6, then Qg7# is mate.\n- **b2h8:** This move threatens Qg7#, but the rook on f8 covers g7.\n- **b2b8:** This move attacks the rook on f8 and bishop on c6, but both are protected.\n\n#### **Calculation: g3g6**\n- If 1. g3g6+ fxg6 (forced), then 2. Qg7# is mate.\n- If 1. g3g6+ hxg6, then 2. Qg7# is mate.\n- If 1. g3g6 and Black does not capture, White threatens Rxg6, winning a piece.\n\n#### **Calculation: b2h8**\n- 1. b2h8+ Kxh8 (if rook moves), but the rook is not on h8.\n- 1. b2h8, no immediate threat as g7 is covered.\n\n### 4. **Conclusion**\nThe move **g3g6** is a direct threat. If Black captures with either pawn, Qg7# is mate. If Black does not capture, White threatens Rxg6, winning a piece.\n\n### 5. **Final Move**\nThe best move is:\n```\ng3g6\n```"
