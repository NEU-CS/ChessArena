When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After Rxf5+ Kxf5, White loses the rook for a pawn, which is not ideal unless it leads to a forced win or draw.\n- g4 is a pawn push, attacking the Black king's escape squares and possibly threatening to trap the king.\n- Rb8, Rb7, Rb6, etc., are rook moves along the b-file. None of them seem to create immediate threats.\n- Kh3 is a king move, but doesn't seem to do much.\n\nLet's look at Rxf5+:\n1. Rxf5+ Kxf5\n2. Kh3 (threatening g4#) but Black has Nxe3, so not immediately dangerous.\n\nWhat about g4?\nIf 1. g4, then:\n- If fxg4, then White can play Re5+ and pick up the knight, but Black doesn't have a pawn on f4.\n- If Kxg4, then White can play Rb4 pinning the knight, but the king can escape.\n- If the Black king moves, White can play Rb1 and try to activate the rook.\n\nBut let's check for mate threats. If 1. g4, Black's king is short on squares:\n- 1. g4 Kxg4 (if king takes)\n- 2. Rb4 pinning the knight, but the king can escape to f5.\n\nAlternatively, what about Rb1, threatening to cut off the knight's escape and possibly play g4 next?\n\nBut the most forcing move is Rxf5+, so let's calculate that line:\n1. Rxf5+ Kxf5\n2. Kh3 (threatening g4#)\nBut Black can play Nxe3, attacking the rook and defending g4.\n\nAlternatively, let's try g4:\n1. g4 Kxg4 (if king takes)\n2. Rb4 pinning the knight, but the king can escape to f5.\n\nAlternatively, what about Rb8, threatening to swing the rook to g8 or h8 for mate threats? But the Black king can escape.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the move that creates the most immediate threats and restricts the Black king is:\n```\ng4\n```"
