If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Legal move:** Rxc8\n\n**Position overview:**\n- Black's king is on b8, White's king is on h1.\n- White has a dangerous a6 pawn and a rook on c8, threatening to promote.\n- Black's rook on d7 and d8, bishop on a7, pawns on f7, h7, g5, f4, e4, and queen on d4.\n- White's queen on c2, rook on c8, rook on c1, bishop on e1, pawns on a6, g2, h2.\n\n**Immediate tactical consideration:**\n- The only legal move is Rxc8, capturing White's rook on c8 with the rook on d8.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- After Rxc8, Black removes the dangerous rook on c8 and maintains material balance.\n- White may recapture with Rxc8, but then Black can play Qg1+ or Qg1+ followed by Qxe1, depending on White's reply.\n- Black must be careful about the a6 pawn, but for now, Rxc8 is forced.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe only legal move is:\n\n```\nRxc8\n```"
