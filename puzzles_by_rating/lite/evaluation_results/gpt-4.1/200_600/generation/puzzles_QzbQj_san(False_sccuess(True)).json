When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n2rq1rk1/1b2bpp1/p3pB1p/np6/3P4/P1NQ1N2/1PB2PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 0 16\n\n**Black to move.**\n\n### 1. Material Count\n- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 6 Pawns\n- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 6 Pawns\n\nMaterial is equal.\n\n### 2. King Safety\n- Black's king is on g8, with some pawn cover but a bit exposed due to the open f-file and the bishop on f6.\n- White's king is on g1, relatively safe.\n\n### 3. Piece Activity\n- White's pieces are very active: bishop on f6, knight on c3, queen on d3, rook on e1, bishop on c2, knight on f3.\n- Black's pieces are a bit cramped, especially the bishop on b7 and the knight on a5.\n\n### 4. Threats\n- White threatens to play Qh7# (mate) if the bishop on f6 is not captured or the h7 square is not covered.\n- The bishop on f6 is a monster, threatening mate and controlling key squares.\n- The knight on a5 is loose and could be a tactical target.\n\n### 5. Candidate Moves\nLet's look at the legal moves and see which ones address the immediate threat of mate:\n\n#### Defensive Moves\n- **g8h8**: Moves the king to h8, but does not address the mate threat.\n- **f8e8**: Moves the rook, does not address the mate threat.\n- **d8e8**: Moves the queen, does not address the mate threat.\n- **g7f6**: Captures the bishop on f6, removing the mate threat.\n- **h6h5**: Does not address the mate threat.\n- **e7f6**: Captures the bishop on f6, removing the mate threat.\n\n#### Let's focus on the two moves that capture the bishop on f6:\n- **g7f6** (pawn takes bishop)\n- **e7f6** (bishop takes bishop)\n\n#### Analyzing g7f6:\n- 16...g7f6\n    - White can play Qh7#, but after g7f6, h7 is covered.\n    - White may try Qh7+ Kf7 Qg6# but after g7f6, the queen cannot go to h7.\n    - White may play Qh7+ Kf7 Bg6# but the pawn on f6 blocks the bishop.\n    - After g7f6, the pawn structure is weakened, but the mate threat is gone.\n\n#### Analyzing e7f6:\n- 16...e7f6\n    - Bishop captures on f6, covering h7.\n    - White can play Qh7+ Kf7 Bg6#, but the bishop on f6 covers g7.\n    - White may try Qh7+ Kf7 Bg6+ Ke7, but the king can escape.\n    - The bishop on f6 is a good defender, but it blocks the rook on f8.\n\n#### Which is better?\n- **g7f6**: Weakens the kingside pawn structure, but opens the g-file for the rook.\n- **e7f6**: Keeps pawn structure, but bishop is passive and blocks the rook.\n\n### 6. Tactics\n- After **g7f6**, White may try Qg6+ Kh8 Qh7#, but after g7f6, the queen cannot go to h7.\n- After **e7f6**, White may try Qh7+ Kf7 Bg6+ Ke7, but the king can escape.\n\n### 7. Long-term Strategy\n- Both moves remove the immediate mate threat.\n- **e7f6** keeps the pawn structure intact and maintains material balance.\n- **g7f6** opens the g-file, but weakens the king.\n\n### 8. Final Decision\n**e7f6** is the best move. It removes the dangerous bishop, keeps the pawn structure, and covers key squares.\n\n## Final Move\n```\ne7f6\n```"
