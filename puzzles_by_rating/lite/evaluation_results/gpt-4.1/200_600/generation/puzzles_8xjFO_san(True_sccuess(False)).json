If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

It gives a check, and after Kxe3, Black can try to harass the king with the rooks. It is likely the best practical chance to create complications, even if objectively White is winning.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxe3+\n```"
