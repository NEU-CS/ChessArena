If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

White's pieces are coordinated, but Black's rooks are very active, especially the b2 rook on the second rank.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rxc4: Captures a rook, but White will recapture with the knight (d3xc4), and Black loses the active rook.\n- Rb8: Defends b3, but not very active.\n- Rxe2: Captures a pawn, but White can respond with Nxe5, forking rook and bishop.\n- Bb8: Retreats bishop, not very active.\n- Bf6: Attacks rook, but White can play Nxb2.\n- Bxg3: Captures a pawn, but White can play hxg3, and Black's bishop is less active.\n- Rc5: Attacks the knight on d3, but White can defend.\n- Rc2: Doubles rooks on the second rank, very active.\n- Rxb3: Captures pawn, but White can play Nxe5.\n\nThe most forcing and active move is:\n- Rc2: Threatens to double on the second rank, and possibly invade with both rooks. White's king is exposed, and Black can create threats.\n\nLet's double-check tactics:\n- After Rc2, White's knight is pinned to the king, and White cannot easily defend the second rank.\n- If White plays Nxe5, Black can play Rxe5, and White's king is exposed.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRc2\n```"
