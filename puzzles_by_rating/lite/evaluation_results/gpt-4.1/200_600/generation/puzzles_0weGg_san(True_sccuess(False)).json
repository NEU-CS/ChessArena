If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Qf6+ exf6 (forced, otherwise Kg8 loses the queen to Qxd8)\n2. Bh6+ Kg8 (if Ke8, then Bxd7+ wins the queen)\n3. Qg7#\n\nBut after 1. Qf6+ exf6, White loses the queen for a pawn, so that's not good unless there is a forced mate.\n\nWait, let's check Qf6+:\n\n1. Qf6+ exf6 (forced)\n2. Bh6+ Kg8\n3. Qg7#\n\nBut after 2. Bh6+, Black can only play Kg8, and then Qg7# is checkmate.\n\nSo, Qf6+ is a forced mate in three.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQf6+\n```"
