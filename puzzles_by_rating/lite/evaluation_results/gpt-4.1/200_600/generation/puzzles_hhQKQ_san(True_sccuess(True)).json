Rd8+ (forcing) Re8 (only move) 28. Rxe8+ Rxe8\n- Now, White has no more advanced pawn, and the position is roughly equal. Black's rook is active, and White's pawns are not dangerous.\n\n**Rxe6** neutralizes White's main threat and leads to an equal rook endgame. Other moves allow White to keep the dangerous e6 pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxe6\n```"
