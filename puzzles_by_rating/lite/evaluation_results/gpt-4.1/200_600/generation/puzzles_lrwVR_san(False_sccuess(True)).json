Re2 (defending second rank)  \n  But Black's rooks are very active.\n\n**Best move:**\n\n- **a1d1** is the most solid move. It contests the open d-file, prevents Black from doubling rooks on the d-file, and keeps White's position solid. White should avoid unnecessary exchanges and keep the tension, as Black's rooks are more active for now. Doubling rooks on the d-file is the best way to fight for activity and avoid passive defense.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\na1d1\n```"

It exchanges rooks and avoids losing material.  \n**g1h2** loses a rook for nothing.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nd1e1\n```"
