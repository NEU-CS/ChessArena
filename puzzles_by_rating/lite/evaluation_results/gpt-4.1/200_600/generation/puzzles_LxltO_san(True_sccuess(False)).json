If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Nf5 gxf5 (if Qxf5, then Nxf5 and White is better)\n- 15. Qxd5+ Kg7 (or Rf7) 16. Qxa8 and White wins a rook.\n\nIf Black plays Qxf5, then Nxf5 and White is threatening Ne7+ and Nh6+.\n\n**Nf5** seems to be the strongest move, creating immediate tactical threats and exploiting Black's weak kingside.\n\nTherefore, my move is:\n```\nNf5\n```"
