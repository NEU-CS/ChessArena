White's pieces are active, especially the rook on e5 and the knight on d4.\n- White threatens Nxc6, attacking the queen and threatening to win more material.\n- Black's queen is attacked by the knight on d4.\n- Black's knight on c3 is also attacked by the rook on e5.\n- White's king is relatively safe, but Black has some tactical resources.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **Qxg2+**: This is a check, forcing White's king to move. After Kxg2, Black can consider Qg6+ or Qg4+ to harass the king, but White's king escapes and Black is still down material.\n2. **Qd6**: Retreats the queen, defending the knight on c3 and keeping the queen active.\n3. **Qb6**: Retreats the queen, but doesn't defend the knight on c3.\n4. **Nd5**: Moves the knight, but White can capture on c6.\n5. **Nb5**: Retreats the knight, but White can still play Nxc6.\n6. **Bd7**: Develops the bishop, but doesn't solve the problem of the attacked queen.\n7. **Qf6**: Retreats the queen, defending the knight and keeping pressure on d4.\n\nLet's look at **Qf6**:\n- Defends the knight on c3.\n- Keeps the queen active.\n- If White plays Bxc3, then Qxe5 wins the rook.\n- If White plays Nxc6, then Qxc6 and Black is fine.\n\nLet's check for tactics:\n- After Qf6, if White plays Re8+, Black can play Bf8, defending.\n- If White plays Nxc6, Qxc6, and Black is safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQf6\n```"
