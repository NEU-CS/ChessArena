If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If ...Qxg2#, that's not possible because the queen is not on g2. If ...Qxg2+, Kxg2, cxd5, Bxd5, White is up material.\n- **Bd4**: Attacks the queen and threatens to win material. If ...Nxh3+, Kh2, Qf4+, g3, Qxf2+, Qxf2, Nxf2, Rxe5, White is up a piece.\n- **Bxf4**: After ...Qxf4, Black's queen is very active.\n\n**Best Move:**\n\n**Nd5** stands out as the most forcing and powerful move, attacking the queen and bishop, and threatening to win material. If Black exchanges on d5, White's pieces become even more active.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nNd5\n```"
