Let's see what happens:\n   - 18...Qd1+ 19. Kxd1 Bxb3 (winning the rook on b3).\n   - After 20. axb3, Black has won the exchange (rook for bishop).\n   - This seems very strong.\n\n3. **Qxh2**: Grabbing a pawn, but not as forcing as Qd1+.\n4. **Bb7**: Developing, but not as strong as the check.\n5. **Nd7**: Developing, but not urgent.\n\n**Calculation for Qd1+:**\n- 18...Qd1+ 19. Kxd1 Bxb3\n- 20. axb3 (forced)\n- Now Black has won a rook for a bishop, a clear material advantage.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is the forcing check, winning material.\n\n```\nQd1+\n```"
