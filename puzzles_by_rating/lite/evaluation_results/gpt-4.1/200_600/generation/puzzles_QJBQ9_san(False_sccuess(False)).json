When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nThe reasoning process should describe how the Assistant analyzes the position and decide on the best move, including: \n- A strategic evaluation of the position. \n- A comparison of key candidate moves. \n- For each candidate, consider the opponent\u2019s likely response and outcome. \n- Conclude with a clear justification for your final choice.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Rd7+ Kc8 (forced)\n- 2. Rb7 (threatening mate on b8)\n- If ...Rc1+ 3. Bxc1 Kxb7 4. Nc5+ Kc6 5. Nxe6 and White is winning.\n- If ...Bd6 3. Nxd6+ cxd6 4. Rxh7 and White is up material.\n\n#### **Candidate 2: e4d6+**\n- 1. Nd6 Bxd6 2. Rb7+ Kc8 3. Rxc7+ Kd8 4. Rxc4 and White is up a piece.\n\n#### **Candidate 3: b6b7**\n- 1. Rb7+ Kc8 2. Rb8+ Kd7 3. Rxf8 Rxe4 4. Rf7+ Kd6 5. Rxh7 and White is up material.\n\n### 6. **Comparing Candidates**\n\n- **d2d7+** is the most forcing, as it puts the king in a mating net and forces Black to respond. It also brings the second rook to the 7th rank, which is a classic attacking motif.\n- **e4d6+** wins material, but is less forcing than the double-rook attack.\n- **b6b7** is strong, but not as direct as d2d7+.\n\n### 7. **Opponent's Likely Response**\nAfter **d2d7+**, Black's king is forced to c8, and then Rb7 threatens mate. Black cannot easily defend.\n\n### 8. **Final Choice**\n\n**d2d7+** is the most forcing and likely leads to a decisive attack or material gain.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Move**\n```\nd2d7\n```"
