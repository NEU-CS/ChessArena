If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Legal moves:** Rf8, Qe8\n\n**Material:**\n- Black: Queen (a4), Rook (f7), Knight (d3), pawns (g7, h7, e6)\n- White: Rook (b8), Rook (f1), pawns (c4, d5, e3, h3, g2), King (g1)\n\n**Position:**\n- Black's queen is very active on a4, eyeing c2 and d1.\n- Black's rook is on f7, can go to f8 or e8.\n- Black's knight is on d3, very strong, attacking e5 and c5.\n- White's rook on b8 is active, but not threatening immediate mate.\n- White's king is relatively safe on g1.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n- Rf8: Rook to f8, defending the back rank and possibly preparing to double rooks or defend against White's threats.\n- Qe8: Queen to e8, a defensive move, but it blocks the rook and is passive.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Rf8**: \n   - Defends the back rank, keeps the queen active.\n   - If White tries Rxf8+, Kxf8, Black is fine.\n   - If White tries to push d5-d6, Black can play Qc2 or Qxc4.\n   - Black keeps pressure and avoids any back rank issues.\n\n2. **Qe8**:\n   - Very passive, blocks the rook, and doesn't create threats.\n   - White can try Rxe8+ or d5-d6, gaining space and initiative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Rf8** is much stronger, keeping the rook on the back rank and the queen active. Black maintains the initiative and avoids passivity.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nRf8\n```"
