When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Bh6 threatens Qxe7 and Qc7#.\n- If Black plays Rxh6, then Qxh6, and White's queen is still very active.\n- If Black plays Qxh6, then Bxh6, and White threatens mate on c7.\n\n**What about Nf5?**\n- 18. Nf5 Qf6 (defending e7 and g7)\n- 19. Nxe7+ Qxe7, White is up a pawn, but Black has defended for now.\n\n**What about Qxe7?**\n- 18. Qxe7 Qxe7 19. Nxe7+ Kd7, White is up a piece.\n\nBut after 18. Bh6, Black is in trouble:\n- If 18... Rxh6 19. Qxh6 Qxd4 20. Rac1, White is still pressing.\n- If 18... Qxh6 19. Bxh6, White threatens mate on c7.\n\n**Best move:**\n18. Bh6 is the most forcing and threatens mate, and Black has no good defense.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne3h6\n```"
