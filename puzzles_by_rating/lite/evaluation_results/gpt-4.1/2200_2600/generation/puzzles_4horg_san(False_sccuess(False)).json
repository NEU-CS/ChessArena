When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The knight on d6 and e7 are menacing, and the queen and rook are well placed. There are potential threats of Qf3 or Qh5, and the knights can coordinate for a mating net.\n- Black's king is exposed, and White's next move could be Qf3 or Qh5, threatening mate or winning more material.\n- Black's queen on a3 is active but not threatening immediate checks or captures.\n- Black's rook on d8 is on an open file but not attacking anything.\n- Black's only hope is to defend and try to exchange pieces or create counterplay.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f8e7: Move the king to e7, but that allows Nxc6, and White's attack continues.\n2. d8e8: Defend the back rank, but White can continue to press.\n3. h8g8: Move the rook, but doesn't solve the problems.\n4. a3d6: Exchange queens, which would relieve some pressure.\n5. a3a2: Attack the pawn on c2, but White can defend easily.\n\nThe best practical chance is to exchange queens with a3d6. This reduces White's attacking potential and gives Black a chance to defend a worse endgame.\n\nFinal move:\n```\na3d6\n```"
