When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qh5h8+ (forces Black king to e7 or f6)\n2. Qh5h7+ (forces Black king to f6)\n3. Qh5g6 (captures queen, but Black recaptures with pawn)\n4. Qh5f5+ (forces Black king to g7 or f6, but Black can block with e6-e5)\n\nLet's analyze Qh5h8+:\n\n- 1. Qh8+ Ke7 (if Kf7, then Qh7+)\n- 2. Qh7+ Kf6 (only move)\n- 3. Qh4+ Kf7 (only move)\n- 4. Qh5 (repeat)\n\nSo, Qh8+ leads to a perpetual check if Black plays correctly.\n\nWhat about Qh5h7+?\n- 1. Qh7+ Kf6 (only move)\n- 2. Qh4+ Kf7 (only move)\n- 3. Qh5 (repeat)\n\nAgain, perpetual check.\n\nWhat about Qh5g6?\n- 1. Qxg6+ Kxg6\n- Now, Black is up a pawn, but White has a passed pawn majority on the queenside. However, Black's king is active and White's king is far.\n\nWhat about b4b5?\n- 1. b5 cxb5\n- 2. c6 bxc6\n- 3. Qh7+ Qg7 (forced)\n- 4. Qxg7+ Kxg7\n- White is down a pawn in the endgame.\n\nWhat about f2e3?\n- No immediate threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhite cannot avoid perpetual check or queen trade, but can force a draw by perpetual check.\n\n**Best move:**  \nLet's play Qh5h8+ to force the perpetual and avoid losing.\n\n```\nh5h8\n```"
