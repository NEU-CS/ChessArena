When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \nr7/4n3/p1k1r3/4q3/3R4/2P2Q2/P2K1P1P/7R b - - 1 29\n\n**Black to move.**\n\n**Material count:**  \n- Black: Rook (a8), Rook (e6), Knight (e7), King (c6), Pawns (a6)\n- White: Rook (d4), Rook (h1), Queen (f3), King (d2), Pawns (a2, c3, f2, h2)\n\n**White's threats:**  \n- White is threatening to double rooks on the d-file, possibly invade the 7th rank, and has a powerful queen on f3.\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on c6.\n\n**Legal moves:**  \n- c6c7 (King to c7)\n- c6b6 (King to b6)\n- c6c5 (King to c5)\n- c6b5 (King to b5)\n- e7d5 (Knight to d5)\n- e5d5 (Queen to d5)\n- e5e4 (Queen to e4)\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. c6c7 (King to c7)\n- Retreats the king, but doesn't solve the underlying issues. White can continue to build pressure.\n\n### 2. c6b6 (King to b6)\n- King moves to the b-file, but is still exposed and could be vulnerable to checks.\n\n### 3. c6c5 (King to c5)\n- King moves forward, but is even more exposed.\n\n### 4. c6b5 (King to b5)\n- King moves to b5, but again, very exposed.\n\n### 5. e7d5 (Knight to d5)\n- Knight blocks the d-file, attacking the queen on f3 and the rook on d4. However, the queen is not on d4, so only attacking the rook on d4. But after cxd4, White can recapture with the queen, increasing pressure.\n\n### 6. e5d5 (Queen to d5)\n- Queen captures rook on d5. If White recaptures with the rook (Rxd5), then Black can play Nxd5, and the position simplifies. Let's check this line:\n    - e5d5\n    - Rxd5 Nxd5\n    - Qxd5+ Kc7 (or Kb6)\n    - White is up material and has a strong attack.\n\n### 7. e5e4 (Queen to e4)\n- Queen moves to e4, attacking the rook on h1 and defending the rook on e6. Also, it centralizes the queen and possibly threatens Qe2+ in some lines.\n\n---\n\n#### Let's look deeper at **e5e4**:\n\n- e5e4\n    - If White plays Rxe4, then Rxe4, and Black is fine.\n    - If White ignores and plays something like Qxe4, then Rxe4, and again, Black is fine.\n    - If White plays Qxe4, Rxe4, and White can play Rxe4, but then Black can play Nf5, attacking the queen and defending e4.\n\nBut after e5e4, White can play Rxe4, and after Rxe4, Qxe4, White wins a piece.\n\nSo e5e4 loses material.\n\n---\n\n#### Let's look at **e5d5**:\n\n- e5d5\n    - Rxd5 Nxd5\n    - Qxd5+ Kc7\n    - White is up a queen for a rook and knight, which is a big material advantage.\n\n---\n\n#### Let's look at **e7d5**:\n\n- e7d5\n    - cxd4+ Kd6 (forced, otherwise White wins material)\n    - White can play Qg3+ (or Qf4+), and Black's king is very exposed.\n\n---\n\n#### Let's look at **c6c7**:\n\n- c6c7\n    - White can play Qf4+ (or Qg3+), and Black's king is still exposed.\n\n---\n\nGiven all this, the least losing move is **e5d5**. It exchanges queens and reduces White's attacking potential, even though Black will be down material. All other moves lose more quickly.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5d5\n```"
