When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White takes with exf6, Black can try to activate the king.\n2. **e6e5:** This move tries to open the center, but after fxe5, White's king can become even more active.\n3. **King moves:** Moving the king doesn't change much, but c7d7 or c7b7 may be considered to stay close to the queenside pawns.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n- If Black plays f6f5 and White responds with exf6, then Black can try to activate the king, but White's king is already very active and can support the b-pawn.\n- If Black plays a king move, White can push b6+ and then b7, and Black's king is forced to the back rank.\n\n**Best chance:**\n- Black's only real chance is to create counterplay on the kingside with f6-f5. Otherwise, White will simply push the b-pawn and win.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf6f5\n```"
