When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a dangerous passed c-pawn and some activity, but White's pieces are well placed.\n\nImmediate threats:  \n- Black's knight on f5 is strong, but not attacking anything immediate.  \n- Black's c-pawn is not yet dangerous.  \n- White's bishops are very active, especially the g3 bishop, which eyes the f4 square and can harass Black's king.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e1e6+ (Rook check, forcing Black's king to move or block with the knight)\n2. g3f5 (Bishop takes knight, but after exf5, Black's king is safer and the e-file opens)\n3. e1e4 (Centralizing rook, attacking bishop)\n4. c2f5 (Bishop attacks king, but can be blocked by knight)\n5. f2f3 (Preparing to break open the kingside, but not urgent)\n6. a3a4 or b3b4 (Expanding on the queenside, but not urgent)\n\nLet's calculate e1e6+:\n- e1e6+ Kf7 (only move), then what?\n- Now, c2f5 is a check, but the king can go to g7.\n- Alternatively, after e1e6+ Kf7, White can play Bxf5, but then exf5 and the king is still relatively safe.\n\nAlternatively, e1e4 attacks the bishop on d4 and keeps up the pressure.\n\nBut e1e6+ is forcing, and Black's king is exposed.\n\nLet's check e1e6+:\n1. e1e6+ Kf7 (only move)\n2. Bxf5 (removes defender of c8, but after Kf7, exf5, the rook is still on c8)\n3. Re1 (threatening Re7+)\nBut after e1e6+ Kf7, White can double rooks on the e-file.\n\nAlternatively, e1e4 attacks the bishop and keeps up the pressure.\n\nBut e1e6+ is the most forcing move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne1e6\n```"
