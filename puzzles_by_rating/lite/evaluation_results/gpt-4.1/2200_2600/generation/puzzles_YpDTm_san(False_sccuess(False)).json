When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a rook (a3), pawn (a6, h4), and king (d6).\n- White's a6 pawn is very close to queening, but Black's rook can potentially get behind it.\n- Black's d4 pawn is advanced and could become dangerous if supported.\n- White's king is active on d6, but Black's rook is well-placed on c2, controlling the second rank.\n- Black's king is on h6, with possible moves to g7, g6, or h5.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. c2c8: Rook behind the a-pawn, stopping its promotion.\n2. d4d3: Pushes the passed pawn, but White can easily stop it with Rxd3.\n3. h6g7/h6g6/h6h5: King moves, but do not address the a-pawn.\n4. c2a2: Rook attacks the a6 pawn directly, but White can defend with Ra5 or Ra4.\n5. c2c6: Rook attacks the a6 pawn and also cuts off the king from the 6th rank.\n\nThe most urgent threat is White's a-pawn. The best defensive resource is to get the rook behind the pawn, which is a well-known endgame principle. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc2c8\n```"
