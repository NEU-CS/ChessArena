When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's rook is on h5, far from the action. Black's bishop is centralized and can support the pawn.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e2f4+ (check, but White can just take with the king, losing the pawn)\n2. e2d4+ (check, but White can take with the king, losing the pawn)\n3. e2g3 (threatening promotion, but not immediately decisive)\n4. e2g1 (threatening promotion, but not immediately decisive)\n5. d8e8 (king move, but not urgent)\n6. d6e5 (bishop move, attacks rook and covers promotion square)\n7. c6c5 (pawn move, but not urgent)\n8. b4b3 (pawn move, but not urgent)\n\nThe most critical idea is to support the e2 pawn's promotion. If the bishop moves to e5, it attacks the rook and supports the e1 promotion square. If the rook moves away, Black can play e1=Q.\n\nLet's check if 1...d6e5 is safe:\n- 1...Be5 attacks the rook. If 2.Rxe5, then dxe5 and the e2 pawn is lost, so White will not take.\n- If 2.Rh1, then e1=Q.\n- If 2.Rh7, then e1=Q.\n- If 2.Ke3, then e1=Q.\n\nSo, 1...Be5 is a strong move, attacking the rook and supporting the pawn's promotion.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd6e5\n```"
