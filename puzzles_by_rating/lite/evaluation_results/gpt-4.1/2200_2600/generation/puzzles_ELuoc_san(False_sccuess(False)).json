When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

But after ...hxg6, White's queen is less active.\n2. **c5f8**: Bxf8+ forces ...Rxf8, trading a strong bishop for a rook, but not decisive.\n3. **f3e5**: Centralizes the knight, attacks the rook on f4, and threatens Nxd7.\n4. **d3g6**: Bxg6 is not possible as there is no bishop on g6.\n5. **e1e5**: Rook lift, attacking the rook on f5 and possibly doubling on the e-file.\n6. **f3g5**: Attacks the rook on f4 and threatens Nxh7.\n\n**Deep Calculation:**\n- **f3e5** attacks the rook on f4 and threatens Nxd7, winning the queen after Bxd7 Nxd7. If ...Rxe5, then Qxe5 and White is very active.\n- **g3g6** is tempting, but after ...hxg6, White's queen is less active.\n- **c5f8** is a forcing move, but after ...Rxf8, White loses the strong bishop for a rook.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **f3e5** is the most promising. It attacks the rook on f4 and threatens Nxd7, which would win the queen. If Black plays ...Rxe5, then Qxe5 and White has a strong attack.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nf3e5\n```"
