When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If we play h3h4, we defend the knight and prepare h5, but it is slow.\n- Moving the knight (g3e4) puts pressure on c5 and f6, and if Bxe4, Rxe4, White has a strong center.\n- d1d8 is tempting, but after Rxd8, Rxd8+ Qxd8, White loses the queen for a rook.\n- f1c4 attacks e6 and f7, but doesn't address the threat to the knight.\n- e1e5 is interesting, attacking c5 and possibly f5, but doesn't defend the knight.\n\n**Best move:**\n- g3e4 is the most logical, centralizing the knight, attacking c5 and f6, and if Bxe4, Rxe4, White has a strong rook on e4 and can double on the e-file.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng3e4\n```"
