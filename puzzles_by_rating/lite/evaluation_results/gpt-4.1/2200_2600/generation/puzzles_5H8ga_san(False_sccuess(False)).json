When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White recaptures with the queen (Qxe6+), Black can play Qxe6, and after Bxe6+, Kg7, Black is safe and up material (bishop for a pawn).\n- **d7e6**: Queen takes bishop. White can play Bxe6+, and after Qxe6, Qxe6+, Kg7, White is still active but Black is up a piece.\n- **d7f7**: Passive, doesn't solve the problem.\n- **King moves**: Unnecessary.\n\n**Tactical Considerations:**\n- After **g4e6**, if White plays Bxe6+, Black can play Qxe6, and after Qxe6+, Kg7, Black is up a piece.\n- If White plays Qxe6+, Black can play Qxe6, Bxe6+, Kg7, and Black is up a piece.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to capture the bishop on e6 with the bishop, gaining material and simplifying the position.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng4e6\n```"
