When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:** g8f8, g8h7\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: Queen (e6), Rook (f1), Pawns (d4, c3, g4, h3, e6)\n- Black: Rook (a2), Queen (b2), King (g8), Pawns (a7, d5, c4, g6)\n\n**Position:**\n- Black's king is on g8, under threat of mate.\n- White's queen on e6 is very powerful, threatening Qe8+ and Qf7#.\n- Black's only legal moves are to move the king to f8 or h7.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- If 1... Kh7, White plays Qf7+ and after Kh8, Qf8# is mate.\n- If 1... Kf8, White plays Qf7# (since the king cannot escape to e8 or g8).\n\nBoth moves lead to immediate mate. Let's check:\n\n1... Kf8\n2. Qf7#\n\n1... Kh7\n2. Qf7+ Kh8\n3. Qf8#\n\nBoth moves lose immediately, but the move Kf8 is slightly more resilient since it avoids mate in one, but still loses to Qf7#.\n\n**Conclusion:** Both moves lose, but I must play one.\n\n```\ng8f8\n```"
