When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's pawns are not immediately threatening, and Black's bishop can control their advance. Black's plan is to keep the White king cut off, prevent pawn advances, and aim to win the pawns.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- King moves: g6h7, g6g7, g6f7, g6h6, g6f6, g6h5, g6g5, g6f5\n- Bishop moves: b5e8, b5d7, b5c6, b5a6, b5c4, b5a4, b5d3, b5e2, b5f1\n\nLet's consider the best plan:\n- The bishop on b5 is already well placed, controlling the c4 and a4 squares, and can easily switch diagonals.\n- The king can approach the White pawns or support the bishop.\n\nIf we play ...Bf1, we attack the c2 pawn directly. If White plays c4, then ...Kf5 and the king invades.\n\nIf we play ...Bc4, we attack the b4 pawn, but White can defend with Kc5.\n\nIf we play ...Kf5, we threaten to attack the pawns with the king.\n\nBut ...Bf1 looks very strong, as it attacks c2 and forces White to react.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb5f1\n```"
