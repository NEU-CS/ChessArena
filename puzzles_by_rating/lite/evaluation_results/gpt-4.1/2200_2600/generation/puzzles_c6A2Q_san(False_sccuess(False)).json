When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's carefully analyze the position:\n\n**FEN:** 8/2Pb4/p7/P2p1k1K/3P3P/8/8/8 b - - 0 51  \nBlack to move.\n\n**Material:**\n- Black: King on f5, pawn on a6, pawn on d7\n- White: King on h5, pawn on a5, pawn on c7, pawn on d4, pawn on h4\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- White's c7 pawn is one step from promotion.\n- Black's d7 pawn is blockading the c7 pawn and can move.\n- Black's a6 pawn is not immediately threatened.\n- Black's king is active.\n\n**Legal moves:**\nd7e8, d7c8, d7e6, d7c6, d7b5, d7a4, f5f6, f5e6, f5f4, f5e4\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- d7e8: Promotes to queen (but c7 pawn is not blockaded anymore, White can play c8=Q).\n- d7c8: Moves pawn to c8, but that's not a promotion.\n- d7e6: Pawn to e6, but White can play c8=Q.\n- d7c6: Pawn to c6, but White can play c8=Q.\n- d7b5: Pawn to b5, but White can play c8=Q.\n- d7a4: Pawn to a4, but White can play c8=Q.\n- f5f6: King to f6, but White can play c8=Q.\n- f5e6: King to e6, but White can play c8=Q.\n- f5f4: King to f4, but White can play c8=Q.\n- f5e4: King to e4, but White can play c8=Q.\n\n**Critical point:** If Black moves the d7 pawn off the d7 square, White will immediately promote c7 to a queen. So, the d7 pawn must stay on d7 to prevent c8=Q.\n\n**King moves:** Let's consider king moves. If Black plays f5e4, the king becomes more active and attacks the d4 pawn. White can promote c8=Q, but then Black can play d7c8 and capture the queen. But after c8=Q, d7c8, White can play d4d5 and try to promote another pawn.\n\nBut let's check if Black can win the d4 pawn or create counterplay.\n\n**If 1...f5e4:**\n- 2.c8=Q d7c8 (captures the queen)\n- 3.d4d5 (White pushes)\n- 3...Ke5 (attacks d5)\n- 4.h5 (White pushes h-pawn)\n- 4...Kxd5 (Black wins d5 pawn)\n- Now Black has two connected passed pawns (a6 and d5), White has a5, h4, h5.\n\nThis seems promising for Black.\n\n**If 1...f5f6:**\n- 2.c8=Q d7c8\n- 3.d4d5 (White pushes)\n- 3...Ke7 (King heads to d6)\n- But White can try to create a passed pawn on the kingside.\n\n**If 1...f5e6:**\n- 2.c8=Q d7c8\n- 3.d4d5+ Kd6 (or Kd7)\n- 4.h5\n\nBut the most active move is f5e4, attacking d4 immediately.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n- d7e6: Pawn to e6, but White can promote.\n- d7b5: Pawn to b5, but White can promote.\n- d7a4: Pawn to a4, but White can promote.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to activate the king with f5e4, immediately attacking White's d4 pawn and preparing to capture it after White promotes and Black recaptures on c8.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf5e4\n```"
