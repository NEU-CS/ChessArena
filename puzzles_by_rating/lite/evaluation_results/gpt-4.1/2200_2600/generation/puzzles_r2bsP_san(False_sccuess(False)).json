When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qg8+ Rxg8 (forced)\n- 2. Rd7 (threatening mate on g7)\n- Black must defend g7, but can't with the queen or rook, as both are blocked by their own pieces or can't reach g7 in time.\n\nLet's check the line:\n1. Qg8+ Rxg8\n2. Rd7 (threatening Rg7#)\n- Black has no way to stop Rg7# on the next move. The only way to delay is to give up material, but it's mate next.\n\nTherefore, **d5g8** is a forced mate in two.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd5g8\n```"
