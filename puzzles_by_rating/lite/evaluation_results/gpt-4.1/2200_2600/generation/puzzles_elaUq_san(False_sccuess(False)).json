When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position:\n\nWhite: King on c2, Knight on a4, Pawn on g4, Pawn on h2  \nBlack: King on e4, Pawn on c3, Pawn on c4, Pawn on g5\n\nIt's White to move.\n\nMaterial: Both sides have a king, White has a knight and two pawns, Black has three pawns.\n\nBlack's c-pawns are dangerous, especially c3 and c4. White's knight on a4 can attack these pawns, but the king is a bit far. White's g4 pawn is blockaded by Black's g5 pawn, and the h2 pawn can advance.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- a4b6: Knight attacks c4 and d5, but c4 is defended by Black's king.\n- a4c5: Knight attacks e4 (king), b3, d3, and threatens to capture c4.\n- a4c3: Knight attacks b1, d1, e2, and covers the c3 pawn.\n- a4b2: Knight moves closer to the king, but doesn't threaten much.\n- c2d1, c2b1: King moves, but doesn't seem urgent.\n- h2h3, h2h4: Pawn moves, but don't influence the queenside race.\n\nThe most critical area is the queenside, where Black's c-pawns are dangerous. The knight should try to stop them.\n\nLet's calculate a4c5:\n1. a4c5 attacks e4 (king) and c4 (pawn).\n   - If Black plays Kd4, then Nc4 attacks both c3 and e3 squares.\n   - If Black plays Kf4, then Nc4 attacks e3 and b6.\n   - If Black ignores, White can play Nxe4, winning a pawn.\n\na4c5 is a check, so Black must respond. Let's see:\n1. a4c5+ Kd4\n   - Nc4 (attacks c3, covers e3)\n   - If Kxc5, then Kxc3, White wins a pawn.\n   - If c2, then Nb3+ (forks king and pawn), winning the pawn.\n\nSo, a4c5+ looks very strong, as it checks the king and attacks the c4 pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na4c5\n```"
