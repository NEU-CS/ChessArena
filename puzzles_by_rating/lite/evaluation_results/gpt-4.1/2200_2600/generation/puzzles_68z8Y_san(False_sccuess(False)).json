When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a rook and five pawns. Black is up a bishop for a pawn.\n\nWhite's c6 pawn is dangerous, but Black's king is well-placed to block it. White's king is active on b5, but Black's rook is on the open c-file.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. d6c7: Captures the dangerous c6 pawn, but allows White to activate the rook with Ra7+.\n2. c8c7: Rook to c7, defending the c6 pawn, but White can play Ra6, attacking the b6 pawn.\n3. e7d8: Bishop to d8, defending c7, but passive.\n4. h6h5: Pawn move, but doesn't address the c6 threat.\n5. f6f5: Pawn move, but doesn't address the c6 threat.\n\nThe most urgent threat is White's c6 pawn. If Black plays d6c7, White can play Ra7+ and then Kd6, but after Kd6, the rook can go to a8, but Black can play Rc8, and the c6 pawn is gone.\n\nLet's check:\n1. d6c7 Ra7+ Kd6 (only move) Ra8 Rc8 (only move) Rxc8 Bxc8, and Black is up a bishop and should win.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the c6 pawn:\n\n```\nd6c7\n```"
