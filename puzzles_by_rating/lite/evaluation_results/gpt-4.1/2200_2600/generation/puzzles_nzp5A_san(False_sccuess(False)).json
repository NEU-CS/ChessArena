After g5e7, Black must recapture with the rook (f8e7), as the king can't take and the bishop is pinned to the king by the queen on a2.\n- No immediate counterplay for Black.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to capture the queen with the bishop.\n\n```\ng5e7\n```"

If Black plays ...d5, then exd5 cxd5 Bb7, White gains activity. If ...f6, then f5 can be played.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc4a6\n```"
