When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Also threatens to invade the 7th rank with the queen.\n2. **g5e7** (Bishop to e7): Attacks the rook on f8 and threatens to exchange off a key defender.\n3. **h4h5** (Pawn to h5): Opens the h-file, possibly for an attack.\n4. **b7d7** (Rook takes knight): Removes a defender, but after Qxd7, Black's queen is more active.\n5. **f3f4** (Pawn to f4): Opens the f-file, but may be premature.\n\n**Deep analysis:**\n\n- **d3d6**: If ...Re8, then Qxd7 Qxd7 Rxd7, White wins a piece. If ...Bxc3, then Qxe6+ Kh8 Qxd7 Bxd2 Qxd6, White is up material and attacking.\n- **g5e7**: If ...Re8, then Bxd6, but Black can recapture with the bishop.\n- **h4h5**: Black can play ...gxh5, but then Qxd6 is strong.\n- **b7d7**: After Qxd7, White's pressure is reduced.\n\n**Best move:**\n**d3d6** is the most forcing and powerful, threatening multiple things and keeping up the pressure.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd3d6\n```"
