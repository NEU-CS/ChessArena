When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position:\n\nWhite: King on a4, pawns on b2 and c3  \nBlack: King on e5, pawn on f7, pawn on c4\n\nIt's White to move.\n\nMaterial: White has two pawns (b2, c3), Black has two pawns (f7, c4).  \nKing activity: White's king is active on a4, Black's king is centralized on e5.\n\nLegal moves:\n- a4b5 (King to b5)\n- a4a5 (King to a5)\n- a4b4 (King to b4)\n- a4a3 (King to a3)\n- b2b3 (pawn to b3)\n- b2b4 (pawn to b4)\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. King moves:\n   - a4b5: King approaches c4 pawn, threatening to capture it.\n   - a4a5: King advances, but doesn't threaten anything immediately.\n   - a4b4: King moves closer to c4 pawn.\n   - a4a3: Retreats, not optimal.\n\n2. Pawn moves:\n   - b2b3: Supports c3 pawn, but doesn't change much.\n   - b2b4: Advances pawn, but cxb3+ is possible, and after axb3, Black gets a passed pawn.\n\nKey idea: The c4 pawn is a target. If White's king can capture it, White will have a clear advantage. The move a4b5 attacks the c4 pawn directly. After Kb5, if Black plays Kd5, White can play Kb4 and then Kxc4. If Black pushes f5, White still captures c4.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play:\n```\na4b5\n```"
