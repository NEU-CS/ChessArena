When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is more centralized, but Black's pawns are more dangerous, especially the b4 pawn.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. a6b7: King moves away from the center, not ideal.\n2. a6a7: King stays on the edge, not active.\n3. a6b6: King moves toward the center, could support b4 pawn.\n4. a6a5: King stays on the edge, not active.\n5. h5g4: Pawn capture, but White can recapture with h3 pawn, opening the h-file.\n6. f5g4: Pawn capture, but White can recapture with h3 pawn.\n7. f7f6: Supports e5 pawn, but not urgent.\n8. h5h4: Pushes h-pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n9. f5f4: Pushes f-pawn, could create a passed pawn.\n10. e5e4: Pushes e-pawn, attacks White king, but White can play fxe4.\n\nThe most promising plan is to activate the king and support the queenside pawns. The move a6b6 brings the king closer to the center and supports the b4 pawn, preparing to advance the queenside majority.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na6b6\n```"
