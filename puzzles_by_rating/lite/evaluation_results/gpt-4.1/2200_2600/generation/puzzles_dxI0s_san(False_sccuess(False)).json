When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If b7b8Q, Black must capture with the king, but the king is on c7, so that's not possible. Actually, after b7b8Q, the king can't capture, but the queen is on b8, and the king is on c7. So, after b7b8Q, Black's king is on c7, White's queen is on b8.\n2. d5d6: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't threaten immediate promotion.\n3. h3h4 or g3g4: Not urgent, as the queenside is the main focus.\n\nLet's check b7b8Q:\n- After b7b8Q, Black's king is on c7, White's queen is on b8.\n- Black's only move is to play Kxb8, but that's not possible.\n- So, after b7b8Q, Black must move. The king can't move to b8 (occupied by queen), can't move to b7 (illegal), can't move to c8 (illegal), can't move to d8 (off the board), can't move to d7 (illegal), can't move to d6 (illegal), can't move to c6 (illegal), can't move to b6 (illegal).\n- So, after b7b8Q, Black's king is stuck, but it's not checkmate yet.\n- Black can play c5c4, but that's not a legal move (pawn is on c5, but c4 is empty).\n- Black's only moves are with the pawns on f4, g5.\n\nAfter b7b8Q, Black can try to push kingside pawns, but White will have a queen and should win easily.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to promote the pawn:\n\n```\nb7b8q\n```"
