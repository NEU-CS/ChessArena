When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black plays ...Qxc7, then Qe7 wins the rook on f4. If ...Rf7, then Qe6 is strong. If ...Qd4, White can play Nxd4.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. c1c7 Qxc7 Qe7 wins the rook on f4.\n2. c1c7 Rf7 Qe6 Rxc7 Rxc7 attacks d6 and g7.\n3. c1c7 Qd4 Nxd4 Rxd4 Qe7 Rg8 Qxd6\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move c1c7 is very strong, activating the rook and creating tactical threats.\n\nMy move:\n```\nc1c7\n```"
