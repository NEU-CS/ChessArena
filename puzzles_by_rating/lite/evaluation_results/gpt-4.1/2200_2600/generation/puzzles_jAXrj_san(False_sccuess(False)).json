When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves: h5h6, f4g4, f5g4\n\nMaterial:\n- Black: King on h5, Queen on f4, Rook on c1, pawns on a6, d6, e2, g6, h7\n- White: King on h1, Queen on e7, Rook on e1, pawns on a2, b2, d2, e6, g4, h3\n\nImmediate threats:\n- White has a powerful queen on e7 and a pawn on e6 threatening to promote.\n- Black's queen and rook are active, and Black has a dangerous passed pawn on e2.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. h5h6: King move, but doesn't seem to do much.\n2. f4g4: Queen captures pawn on g4, threatening mate on g2.\n3. f5g4: Pawn captures pawn on g4, but then White can play Qxh7+ and start checks.\n\nLet's analyze f4g4:\n\n1. ... Qxg4\n   - Threatens Qg2# (mate).\n   - White must stop mate. Possible defenses:\n     - Qxh7+ Kg5 (forced), then h4+ Qxh4+ (forced), Kg2 Qxe1, and Black is winning.\n     - Rook to g1, but then Qxg1+ Rxg1 Rxg1# (mate).\n     - White has no checks except Qxh7+.\n\nLet's check Qxh7+:\n\n2. Qxh7+ Kg5 (only move)\n3. h4+ Qxh4+ (forced)\n4. Kg2 Qxe1 (Black wins the rook, and White has no more checks; Black is winning.)\n\nTherefore, f4g4 is crushing and leads to mate or decisive material gain.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nf4g4\n```"
