When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook and 4 pawns.  \nKing positions: Both kings are relatively exposed, but Black's king is more centralized and active.\n\nTactical considerations:\n- The rook on h5 is very active, and can check the Black king along the 5th rank.\n- Black's king is on e4, and the rook is on d3, so checks along the 5th rank could be dangerous for Black.\n- The move h5e5 is a check, and the Black king has limited escape squares: d4, f4, and possibly d5 (but d5 is covered by the rook).\n- If h5e5+, Black can play Kd4, but then White can play Rxa5, winning a pawn.\n- If h5e5+, Kd4, Rxa5, Black can try to get counterplay with g3 or f3, but White's king is relatively safe for now.\n- Alternatively, h5e5+ forces the Black king to move, and White can start picking up pawns.\n\nOther candidate moves:\n- h5g5 or h5f5: Also check, but less forcing than h5e5+.\n- h5h8, h5h7, h5h6: Not checks, and don't seem to threaten anything immediate.\n- g2g3: Defends h4, but not urgent.\n- a2a4: Pushes the pawn, but not urgent.\n\nBest move:\n- h5e5+ is the most forcing move, checking the king and potentially winning a pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh5e5\n```"
