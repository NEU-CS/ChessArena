When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black allows Kg6, White can threaten Bg7, winning the bishop.\n- Black's bishop is currently defending g7.\n- If Black plays f8g7, White plays Kg6, and after Bf8, Bg7+ wins the bishop.\n- If Black plays f8e7, White plays Kg6, threatening Bg7+.\n- If Black plays g5g4, White can play hxg4, and Black's kingside is weakened.\n- If Black plays c6c5, White can play dxc5, opening the d-file.\n\n**Best move:**\n- The only move that keeps the balance and doesn't lose material immediately is to keep the bishop on f8, perhaps with a waiting move.\n- Moving the king is possible, but f7g8 or f7e8 are very passive.\n- f8d6 attacks the bishop, but after Bxd6, cxd6, White's king can enter via g6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The best move is to keep the bishop on f8, but since all bishop moves lose material or allow White's king to invade, the least bad is to play **f8d6**, forcing the exchange of bishops and hoping to hold the pawn endgame.\n\nSo, the move is:\n```\nf8d6\n```"
