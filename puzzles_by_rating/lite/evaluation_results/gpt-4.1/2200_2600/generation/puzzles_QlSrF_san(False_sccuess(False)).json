When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Let's look at the candidate moves:\n\n1. d3c3: King to c3. This steps away from the center and doesn't seem to help.\n2. d3e2: King to e2. Retreats, but doesn't help much.\n3. d3d2: King to d2. Retreats, but doesn't help.\n4. d3c2: King to c2. Retreats, but doesn't help.\n5. e3e4: Pawn to e4. This is the most aggressive move, challenging Black's center and opening lines.\n\nLet's analyze e3e4:\n\n- If ...Kxe4, then d4-d5+ forks king and pawn.\n- If ...fxe4+, then Kc3 or Kd2, and White can try to attack the e4 pawn later.\n- If ...fxe4, then Kc3, and White can try to win the e4 pawn.\n\nOther king moves don't seem to help White's position, as Black's king is more active and can start picking off pawns.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play e3e4, challenging Black's center and opening up possibilities.\n\nFinal move:\n```\ne3e4\n```"
