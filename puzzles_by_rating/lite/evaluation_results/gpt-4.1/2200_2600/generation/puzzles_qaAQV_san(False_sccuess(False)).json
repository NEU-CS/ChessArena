When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:** g1h1, g1f1\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: Rooks on a1 and c1, Knight on e6, pawns on b4, c3, a2, g2, h2, King on g1\n- Black: Rook on d2 and a8, Bishop on f2, pawns on c6, f5, g7, h7, King on g8\n\n**Position:**\n- White's king is on g1, only legal moves are to h1 or f1.\n- Black's rook on d2 and bishop on f2 are cutting off the White king's escape squares.\n- The only two legal moves are king moves: g1h1 and g1f1.\n\n**Threats:**\n- Black is threatening to checkmate with ...Rd1# if White moves the king to f1 (since the rook on c1 is pinned by the bishop on f2).\n- If White plays g1h1, Black can play ...Re8, threatening ...Rxe6, but White's king is not in immediate danger.\n\n**Analysis of both moves:**\n\n1. **g1h1**  \n   - King moves to h1.\n   - Black cannot immediately checkmate.\n   - White can try to bring the knight back or push pawns to defend.\n\n2. **g1f1**  \n   - King moves to f1.\n   - Black can play ...Rd1# (checkmate), since the rook on c1 is pinned by the bishop on f2.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMoving to f1 loses instantly to ...Rd1#. The only move to avoid immediate checkmate is g1h1.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng1h1\n```"
