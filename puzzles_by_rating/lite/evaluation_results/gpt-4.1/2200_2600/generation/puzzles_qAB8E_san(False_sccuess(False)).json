When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The queen is threatening mate on g7 (Qxg7#).\n- Black's queen on f3 is attacking d1 and h1, but White's king is on d2, so no immediate mate.\n- Black's knight on f2 is attacking h1 and d1.\n- Black's queen and knight coordinate to threaten d1 and h1.\n- White's king is exposed on d2.\n\n**Tactical ideas:**\n- Black can consider Qf4+ or Qe3+ to harass the White king.\n- Black can also consider Nxe4, but the knight is doing a lot on f2.\n- Black must address the threat of Qxg7#.\n\n**Defensive needs:**\n- The most urgent threat is Qxg7#.\n- The only way to stop this mate is to move the f8 rook to f7, f6, or f5, or to play Qf7, but the queen is on f3.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **f8f7**: Defends g7, but after Qh7+ Kf8 Qh8+ Ke7 White is still pressing.\n2. **f8f6**: Defends g7, but White can play Nxf6+.\n3. **f8f5**: Defends g7, but White can play Qxg7#.\n4. **f8f4**: Does not defend g7.\n5. **f3f7**: Queen to f7, but White can play Nf6+.\n6. **f3f6**: Queen to f6, but White can play Nxf6+.\n7. **f3g4**: Queen to g4, but White can play Qxg7#.\n8. **f3f5**: Queen to f5, but White can play Qxg7#.\n\n**Best defense:**\n- Only **f8f7** and **f8f6** defend g7 directly.\n\n**Check for tactics:**\n- After **f8f7**, if White plays Qh7+, then Kf8, Qh8+ Ke7, White has no immediate mate, but can continue to press.\n- After **f8f6**, White can play Nxf6+ (removing the defender), and after Rxf6, Qxg7# is mate.\n\nSo, **f8f7** is the only move that stops mate immediately.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf8f7\n```"
