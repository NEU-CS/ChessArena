When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White plays Bxh3, then Bxh3, and the g-pawn is pinned. If Kxh3, then Qd7+ is possible, but White can block with g4.\n- g4h3 is not check, but threatens Bxf1 and opens the h-file.\n- e7c5 removes a dangerous knight.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- After f4h3+, White must respond. If Bxh3, then Bxh3, and the bishop is very strong on h3, threatening mate ideas.\n- If Kxh3, then Qd7+ is possible, but White can block with g4.\n- If g4h3, White can play Bxh3, but then Black has pressure.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Black has a strong kingside attack. The move f4h3+ forces White to respond and opens lines.\n\n**Best move:**\nAfter careful analysis, the move f4h3+ is the most forcing and dangerous for White, as it opens the h-file and threatens mate ideas.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nf4h3\n```"
