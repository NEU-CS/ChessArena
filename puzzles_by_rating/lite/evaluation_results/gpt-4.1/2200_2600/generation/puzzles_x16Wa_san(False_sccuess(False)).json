When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White is up in material and has an active rook. Black's king is centralized, but White's rook is well placed.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. c5c6: Checks the Black king, forcing it to move. After Kc7, White can consider b5 or c4.\n2. c5e5: Rook takes pawn, but then Black can play fxe4, opening up the position for Black's king and pawns.\n3. c5d5: Rook attacks e5 pawn, but not as forcing as c6+.\n4. b4b5: Prepares to push b6, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.\n5. h3h4: Slow, doesn't impact the center or queenside.\n6. c3c4: Supports b5, but again, not as forcing.\n7. f2f3 or f2f4: Opens up kingside, but White's king is far from the action.\n\nThe most forcing move is c5c6+, checking the king. After Kc7, White can play b5, threatening b6 and b7. White's rook is very active, and Black's pawns are not dangerous yet.\n\nLet's check for tactics:\n- c5c6+ Kc7 (forced), then b5. If axb5, cxb5, White has a passed pawn.\n- If b7-b6, White can play c4, supporting b5.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc5c6\n```"
