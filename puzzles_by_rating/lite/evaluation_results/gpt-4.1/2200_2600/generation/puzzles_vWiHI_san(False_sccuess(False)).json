When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxa7 (threatening mate on a8)\n   - If ...Qxc2+, Kxc2, Re2+ wins the queen, but White's queen is on a7, so not possible.\n   - If ...Nb5, then Kc1, and White is safe.\n   - If ...Qb4+, White can block with c3.\n\nAlternatively, after d3e4, if ...Qxb2, White can play Qxa7, threatening mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to eliminate the strong knight with d3e4, opening up the position for White's pieces and threatening Qxa7.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd3e4\n```"
