When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is relatively safe.\nThreats: Black threatens ...Qg3+ ideas, but White's queen and bishop coordinate well.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- e3c5: Bishop takes pawn, attacks rook and threatens mate on f8.\n- a3a6: Queen takes pawn, but doesn't threaten much.\n- d1d4: Rook centralizes, but not very forcing.\n- d5d6: Pawn push, but Black can ignore.\n- g2g3: Gives luft, but not urgent.\n\nTactics:\n1. e3c5 attacks the rook on b4 and threatens Qf8# if the bishop is not captured.\n2. If ...Qxe4, White has Bxb4, winning the rook.\n3. If ...Rxc4, White has Qf8#.\n\nCalculation:\n- 1. Bxc5 Qxe4 2. Bxb4 Qf5 (defending f8) 3. Qxa6, White is up a rook and bishop for a pawn.\n- 1.
