When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If the queen moves, White can capture the rook. If the queen captures the bishop, White can recapture with the queen and threaten mate on g7.\n- **g3d6** (Bishop to d6) attacks the queen and covers e7, but after Qd7, Black is fine.\n- **g3b8** (Bishop to b8) attacks the rook, but the bishop is out of play.\n- **d2f3** (Queen to f3) attacks the knight, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n- **c4c5** (Pawn to c5) attacks the queen, but after Qe6, Black is fine.\n- **e4e5** (Pawn to e5) attacks the knight, but after Qe6, Black is fine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **g3c7** is a powerful double attack, threatening to win material. If Black plays Qc7, then Qc7, and White threatens mate on g7. If Black moves the queen, White wins the rook on a8.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng3c7\n```"
