When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's queen is very active on b7, threatening b7c6+ and b7a8. The knight on f7 is also very strong, attacking the bishop on d6 and threatening to jump to g5 or h6. Black's king is exposed on d7.\n\n**Tactical ideas:**\n- b7c6+ is a forcing check, but after Kc8 or Ke7, White needs to follow up.\n- f7d6+ is a check, but after c7xd6, the queen can recapture, but then the king escapes.\n- The queen on h4 is eyeing b4 and f2, but White's king is relatively safe on b3.\n- The bishop on f5 is pinned by the queen on b7 to the king on d7.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. b7c6+ (check)\n2. f7d6+ (check)\n3. b7a8 (capture rook)\n4. b7f3 (attack queen)\n5. c3d5 (knight jump, but not check)\n6. h1g1 (bring rook to open file)\n\nLet's analyze the most forcing move: **b7c6+**\n\n1. b7c6+ Kd8 (only move, as Ke7 runs into Qd7#)\n2. Qxa8+ (if K moves to e7, Qd7# is mate)\n3. If K moves to c8, then Qxa8 wins the rook.\n\nAlternatively, after b7c6+ Kd8, White can play Qxa8+ and then Qxa8, winning the rook and keeping the attack.\n\n**Let's check f7d6+**\n1. f7d6+ c7xd6 (forced)\n2. Qxa8 (win the rook, but lose the knight)\n\nBut b7c6+ is more forcing and keeps the initiative.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\nb7c6\n```"
