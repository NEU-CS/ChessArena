When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black can respond with Kh8 or Kf8. After Kh8, White can continue the attack, but let's see if it's decisive.\n\n2. **d5c6 (Bxc6)**: Bishop captures pawn on c6, attacking the queen on c3. If Black recaptures with the queen, White can play Qc4+ or Qb6, but this doesn't seem to lead to a direct win.\n\n3. **d5e5 (Be5)**: Bishop moves to e5, attacking the queen on c3 and defending the f4 square. But Black can play Qxa1+ and grab the rook.\n\n4. **d5e4 (Be4)**: Bishop moves to e4, attacking the queen and defending f5. But again, Black can play Qxa1+.\n\n5. **c5d6 (Qd6)**: Queen moves to d6, attacking the bishop on g5 and threatening Qxe5. But Black can play Rxd6, winning the queen.\n\n6. **b5d7 (Qd7)**: Queen moves to d7, threatening Qf7# (mate). Black must respond to the mate threat. The only way to stop mate is Rxd7, but then Bxe6+ is devastating.\n\nLet\u2019s look closer at **b5d7 (Qd7)**:\n- Threatens Qf7# (mate).\n- If Black plays Rxd7, then Bxe6+ is crushing: Kh8, Bxd7, and White is up material and attacking.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- 1. Qd7 Rxd7\n- 2. Bxe6+ Kh8 (forced)\n- 3. Bxd7 and White is up a rook and bishop for a queen, but with a strong attack and Black's king is exposed.\n\nAlternatively, after Qd7, if Black tries to ignore and play ...Kh8, then Qf7 is mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**b5d7 (Qd7)** is the strongest move, threatening mate and forcing Black to give up material or get mated.\n\nMy move:\n```\nb5d7\n```"
