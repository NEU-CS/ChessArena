When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

So, not a fork.\n2. **d5c7** (Knight to c7): Attacks rook and bishop, but after ...Qxc7, White loses a piece.\n3. **d5f6+**: Knight check. If ...Qxf6, White loses a piece. If ...gxf6, White can try Qxg4+ but nothing immediate.\n4. **d5b6**: Attacks bishop, but bishop can move.\n5. **d5e3**: Retreat, not necessary.\n6. **d1g4**: Queen to g4, attacking g7 and threatening f5.\n7. **f4f5**: Pawn push, attacking the bishop and opening the f-file.\n8. **h2h3**: Kicks the knight, but not urgent.\n9. **c2c3**: Kicks the bishop, but bishop can retreat to d6.\n\n**Tactical ideas:**\n- The move **f4f5** stands out: it attacks the bishop on c5, and if the bishop moves, White can consider Qxg4, threatening f6 and g7.\n- **d1g4** is also interesting, eyeing g7 and f6.\n- **d5f6+** is a forcing move, but after ...Qxf6, White loses a piece.\n\nLet's calculate **f4f5**:\n- If ...Bxf5, Rxf5, White has pressure on the f-file.\n- If ...Nf2+ (after f4f5), Rxf2, Bxf2, Qxg4, White is up a piece.\n- If ...h5, Qxg4, White threatens f6.\n\n**Let's check for tactics with the knight:**\n- d5e7: Not possible, as it doesn't fork anything.\n- d5f6+: After ...Qxf6, White loses a piece.\n\n**What about d1g4?**\n- Threatens f6 and g7.\n- If ...Nf2+, Rxf2, Bxf2, Qxg7# is not possible, as the bishop covers g7.\n\n**What about c2c3?**\n- Kicks the bishop, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n**Best move:**\n**f4f5** is the most aggressive, opening the f-file and attacking the bishop. It also threatens f6 in the future, and if Black exchanges on f5, White's rook becomes active.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf4f5\n```"
