When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's queen is active on b4, and the bishop on e6 is a strong defender. The e-file is contested, and Black's rooks are active.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f4c7+ (Rook c1 to c7 check) - This puts pressure on the Black king and could force it to a less safe square.\n2. f4c8 (Rook c1 to c8) - Threatens back rank ideas, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.\n3. f4f7 (Queen f4 to f7) - Attacks the rook on g6 and threatens mate on e8, but the bishop on e6 covers e8.\n4. e5e6 (Rook e5 to e6) - Attacks the bishop, but Black can recapture with the rook.\n5. f4c1 (Queen f4 to c1) - Retreats, not optimal.\n6. f4h6 (Queen f4 to h6) - Threatens mate on h8, but Black can defend.\n\nLet's look at 1. Rc7+:\n\nIf 1. Rc7+ Kd8 (only move), then 2. Qd6+ (threatening mate and the rook on g6), but Black can play Qxd6, and after Rxd6+ Ke7, White has no immediate win.\n\nAlternatively, what about 1.
