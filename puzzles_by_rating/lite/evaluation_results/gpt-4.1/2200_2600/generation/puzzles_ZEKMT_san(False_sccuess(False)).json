When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:**  \n- g4h5 (Kg4-h5)\n- g4g5 (Kg4-g5)\n- g4h4 (Kg4-h4)\n- g4f4 (Kg4-f4)\n\n**Position overview:**\n- White's king is on d1, Black's king is on g4.\n- White's queen is on c5, Black's queen is on b2.\n- White has a rook on a1 and h1, bishop on d3, pawns on a4, f2, g2, h3.\n- Black has a rook on a8 and h8, bishop on c8, pawns on a7, b7, d5, e6, f7, g7, h7.\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- Black's king is exposed on g4, but White's queen and bishop are not immediately threatening mate.\n- Black's queen on b2 is active, but not threatening anything immediate.\n- White's queen on c5 is very active, eyeing the kingside and central squares.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **Kg4-h5:** Retreats the king to h5, but this puts the king on the edge and could be dangerous if White can swing a rook or queen over.\n2. **Kg4-g5:** Moves the king forward, but this is very risky and exposes the king further.\n3. **Kg4-h4:** Moves the king to h4, but this is also risky, possibly walking into a mating net.\n4. **Kg4-f4:** Moves the king toward the center, but f4 is covered by White's bishop on d3, so this would be illegal (but it's listed as legal, so perhaps the bishop is pinned or something is off).\n\nLet's check if Kg4-f4 is safe:\n- White's bishop on d3 controls f1-a6 diagonal, so f4 is controlled.\n- But according to the legal moves, Kg4-f4 is allowed, so perhaps the bishop is pinned or unable to capture.\n\nLet's check each move for tactical consequences:\n\n**1. Kg4-h5**\n- White could play Qe3, threatening g4 and h7.\n- White could also try Be2+, but that's not possible as the bishop is on d3.\n- White could try Qe7, but that doesn't threaten anything immediate.\n\n**2. Kg4-g5**\n- White could play Qe3+, forcing the king to h4 or f4.\n- If Kh4, White could play g3+ and then Qh6#.\n- If Kf4, White could play g3+ and then Qf4#.\n\n**3. Kg4-h4**\n- White could play Qe7+, forcing Kh5 or g5.\n- If Kh5, White could play g4# (but pawn is on h3, so not possible).\n- If g5, White could play Qg5#.\n\n**4. Kg4-f4**\n- If the king goes to f4, White could play Qe3#, but the bishop on d3 is blocking e3, so that's not possible.\n- If the king is on f4, White could play g3+, but the king could go to f3 or g5.\n\nGiven all this, **Kg4-h5** seems the safest, as it keeps the king away from the center and avoids immediate checks.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng4h5\n```"
