When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White plays Kg3, then Qe5+ is possible, but White can block with f4.\n2. **c3d2+**: Queen check, but White can block with Rxd2.\n3. **c3e1+**: Queen check, but White can block with Rxe1.\n4. **h8g8**: Bringing the rook into play, threatening to swing over to g5 or g7.\n5. **f7f5**: Opens the f-file and threatens fxe4+.\n6. **e7e6**: Attacks the queen, but White can simply move the queen.\n7. **g6g5**: Threatens g4+, but White can play Qe2 or Qe1.\n8. **b8d7**: Develops the knight, but not urgent.\n\n**Tactical Considerations:**\n- The move **d4f6+** is very forcing. After Bf6+, if White plays Kg3, then Qe5+ is possible, and White's king is very exposed.\n- If White plays Ke2 after Bf6+, then Qe5 is a strong follow-up, threatening mate on e2.\n- If White plays Kg4 after Bf6+, then h5# is mate, but the pawn is on h7, so not possible yet.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. **15...Bf6+**\n   - 16. Kg3 (only move)\n   - 16...Qe5+ (threatening mate)\n   - 17. Qxe5 Bxe5+ (White must give up the queen, Black wins)\n\nSo, **Bf6+** is a winning move, as it forces White to give up the queen or get mated.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nd4f6\n```"
