When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is somewhat passive, but White's pawns are not immediately threatening.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f7g8 (King to g8): Retreats the king, but doesn't improve position.\n2. f7f8 (King to f8): Similar, but less active.\n3. f7e8 (King to e8): Centralizes king, but could be cut off by White's king.\n4. f7e7 (King to e7): Centralizes and keeps options open.\n5. g7g6 (Pawn to g6): Fixes kingside pawns, but could become a target.\n6. b7b6 (Pawn to b6): Tries to open queenside, but after cxb6, a pawn trade favors White's king activity.\n7. h6h5 (Pawn to h5): Fixes kingside, but could become a target.\n8. a6a5 (Pawn to a5): Tries to open queenside, but White can respond with bxa5.\n9. g7g5 (Pawn to g5): Aggressive, but White can respond with g4, fixing the structure.\n10. b7b5 (Pawn to b5): Tries to open queenside, but White can respond with cxb6.\n\nBest move:\nThe king is currently well-placed to defend both sides. Advancing the kingside pawns (g6 or h5) could create weaknesses. On the queenside, pushing a6-a5 is less committal than b6 or b5, and may help to fix White's pawns or open lines for Black's king to activate later.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na6a5\n```"
