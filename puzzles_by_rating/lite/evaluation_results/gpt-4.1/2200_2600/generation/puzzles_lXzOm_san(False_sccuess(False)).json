When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White can defend with g2-g3.\n2. **f5g4**: Queen to g4, threatening h4-h3 ideas, but White can play h3.\n3. **f5e6**: Queen to e6, defending the king and keeping central control.\n4. **f5g6**: Queen to g6, eyeing the kingside.\n5. **d5d4**: Pawn push, gaining space and opening lines.\n6. **h5h4**: Pawn push, threatening h3 in the future.\n7. **c7e6**: Knight to e6, centralizing and defending.\n8. **f7g8**: King to g8, tucking away from checks.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- Is there an immediate threat from White? Not really; no checks or captures are available.\n- Can Black create a threat? The queen on f5 is well placed for kingside attack.\n- Is there a risk of back rank mate? Not immediately, but always worth keeping in mind.\n\n**Best move?**\n- **f5h3** is tempting, but after g2-g3, White is safe.\n- **h5h4** is a useful waiting move, preparing h3 and possibly opening the h-file.\n- **d5d4** grabs space and opens the d5 square for the knight or bishop.\n- **f5g6** keeps the queen active and flexible.\n- **f7g8** is a safe king move, but not necessary yet.\n\n**Let's check f5h3:**\n1. ... Qh3 2. g3 h4 3. gxh4 Rxh4 and Black is threatening mate on h1, but White can defend with Qd6 or Qd4.\n\n**Let's check h5h4:**\n1. ... h4 2. Qb4 (threatening Qxb7) h3 3. g3 and Black can continue the attack.\n\n**Let's check d5d4:**\n1. ... d4 2. exd4 Qxd4, centralizing the queen.\n\n**Let's check f5g6:**\n1. ... Qg6, keeping the queen flexible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **h5h4** is a strong move, preparing h3 and opening the h-file for attack. It also restricts White's kingside pawns and keeps the initiative.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nh5h4\n```"
