When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Knight on c5.\n\nMaterial: Black is down a pawn, but White's pawns are advanced and dangerous. Black's bishop is active, and White's king is centralized.\n\nImmediate threats:\n- White's c5 knight is strong, but not immediately threatening.\n- White's king is active, but not yet breaking through.\n- Black's bishop on g4 eyes the f3 and e2 squares, possibly harassing the White king or targeting pawns.\n- Black's king is somewhat passive, but can become active.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g7g5: Fixes the h-pawn, but weakens the kingside.\n2. h5h4: Gains space, but White can play b4 or a6.\n3. e6e5+: Forces the White king to move, but after f4xe5, Black has no immediate follow-up.\n4. g4f5: Attacks the White king, but White can play b4 or a6.\n5. c7d8: King centralization, but not urgent.\n6. d5d4: Not legal (no pawn on d5).\n7. g4f3: Attacks the b3 pawn, but White can defend.\n8. g4h3: Bishop to the edge, not optimal.\n9. g4f3: If White plays b4, Black can play e5+.\n\nBest move:\n- e6e5+ is a forcing move, driving the White king away from the center and possibly allowing Black to activate the king or bishop. If White plays f4xe5, Black can play Kc6 and try to attack the a5 pawn or support the bishop.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne6e5\n```"
