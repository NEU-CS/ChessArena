When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position:\n\nBlack: King on g6, pawns on f5, h4  \nWhite: King on f4, pawns on f3, g3, h3\n\nIt's Black to move.\n\nWhite's king is active and can try to invade on the kingside. Black's king is also active. Black's main plan is to keep the kingside pawns together and avoid losing any of them, while trying to create a passed pawn or force a draw.\n\nLet's consider the legal moves:\n\n1. **h6h7**: Pushes the h-pawn, but doesn't immediately threaten anything. White can respond with g4, trying to break up Black's pawn structure.\n2. **h6g7**: King to g7. This is a retreat, but it keeps the king close to the pawns.\n3. **h6h5**: King to h5. This puts the king on the edge, but it could help support the h4 pawn.\n4. **h4g3**: Pawn takes on g3. This gives up the h-pawn for a trade, but after fxg3, White has a protected passed pawn on the f-file and a 3 vs 2 majority, which is likely losing for Black.\n5. **g6g5**: King to g5. This keeps the king active and central, and attacks the f3 pawn.\n\nLet's analyze **g6g5**:\n\n- If g6g5, White can play g4, after which Black can play f4+ and try to create counterplay.\n- If White plays Ke5, Black can play h4-h3, trying to create a passed pawn.\n\n**h6g7** is passive and allows White to improve their position.\n\n**h6h5** puts the king on the edge, which is generally not ideal.\n\n**h6h7** is a waiting move, but doesn't improve Black's position.\n\n**h4g3** is losing.\n\n**g6g5** is the most active move, keeping the king central and threatening to attack White's pawns.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng6g5\n```"
