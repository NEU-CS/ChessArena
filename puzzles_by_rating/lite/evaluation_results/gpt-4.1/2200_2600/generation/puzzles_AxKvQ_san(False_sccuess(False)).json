When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

After e2, if White plays Rxe2, then Black can play Nf6 (if White's knight moves), but after e2, White must respond. If White plays Kf2, then e1=Q is possible, but White can play Rxe1. However, after e2, White's rook is tied to the second rank.\n\n- Alternatively, activating the rook with h8-h1 is not possible, but h8-h7 or h8-h6 could prepare to swing the rook over.\n\n- e3-e2 is the most direct and forces White to respond.\n\n**Check for tactics:**\n- e3-e2, Rxe2, Nf6 (if knight moves), but after e2, White's rook is tied down.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne3e2\n```"
