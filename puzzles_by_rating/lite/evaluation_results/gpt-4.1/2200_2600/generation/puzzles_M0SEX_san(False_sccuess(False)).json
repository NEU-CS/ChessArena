When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Kxg1, Black can play e2e1+ and force the king to h2 or f2, but White can interpose with rook or king.\n- However, after 1... g2g1+ 2. Kxg1, Black loses a rook for nothing.\n\n- What about 1... e2e1+? 2. Kxe1, g2g1+ 3. Ke2 (or Kd2), and again, Black loses a rook.\n\n- What about 1... g2g6? This attacks the f6 rook, but White can play Rxf5+ and then Rg5, threatening mate.\n\n- What about 1... Kxf3? Not possible, as there is no pawn on f3.\n\n- What about 1... f4g3? Retreats the king, but White can play Rg5+ and then Rg4, threatening mate.\n\n- What about 1... Rg2g3? Not possible, as the rook is on g2.\n\n- What about 1... e2e3? This attacks the h3 pawn, but White can play Rxf5+ and then Rg5.\n\n- What about 1... Rg2g5? Not possible.\n\n- What about 1... Rg2g1? This is a check, but after Kxg1, Black loses a rook.\n\n- What about 1... Rg2g7? This doesn't do much.\n\n- What about 1... Rg2g6? This attacks the f6 rook, but White can play Rxf5+ and then Rg5.\n\n- What about 1... Rg2g4? Not possible.\n\n- What about 1... Rg2g5? Not possible.\n\n- What about 1... h7h6?
