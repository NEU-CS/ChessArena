When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White accepts, Black's king can become more active, but White's connected passed pawns on the kingside could be dangerous.\n2. **b2b1**: Keeps the rook active, possibly threatening to check from the back rank.\n3. **b2h2**: Swings the rook to the kingside, possibly to check or attack pawns.\n4. **e6d5**: Centralizes the king, but allows White's rook to become more active.\n5. **h6h5, g6g5, f6f5**: Pawn moves, but they don't seem urgent.\n6. **d6d5**: Advances the pawn, but could be blockaded.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n- If I play **b2b7**, White will likely trade rooks, and after Kf3xe4, White's king is very active and can support the pawn majority. This could be dangerous for Black.\n- If I play **b2h2**, I threaten to check on h3 and harass the White king and pawns.\n- If I play **b2b1**, I keep the rook active and can swing to the kingside or check from behind.\n- **e6d5** allows White to play Ra5+ and harass my king.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **b2h2** is the most active. It threatens to check on h3, and if White plays Kg3, I can play h5 and try to create counterplay on the kingside. Keeping the rook active is crucial in rook endgames.\n\nTherefore, my move is:\n```\nb2h2\n```"
