When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

After Bxh6, Bxh6, Qxh6, White is threatening mate on g7.\n2. **Qh4**: Offers a queen trade, but after Qh4, Qh4, gxh4, White is up material and Black's king is exposed.\n3. **Qe7**: Defends h6, but White can play Qxh6, Bxh6, Nf6+.\n4. **Qd7**: Defends h6, but White can play Nf6+.\n5. **Qb6**: Attacks b2, but doesn't address the threats.\n6. **Rf8**: Defends f7, but doesn't address h6.\n7. **Qh4**: Offers a queen trade, but White can decline.\n\n**Best move:**\n- The most urgent threat is Qxh6, so defending h6 is critical.\n- **Qh4** is the most direct defense, offering a queen trade. If White trades queens, Black's king is safer. If White declines, Black at least covers h6.\n\nLet's check if Qh4 is legal and safe:\n- Qd8-h4 is legal.\n- If Qh4, Qh4, gxh4, White is up material but the immediate threats are gone.\n- If White declines, Black has covered h6.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd8h4\n```"
