When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is more centralized, but White's king is not far away. The queenside pawns are locked, but White has a passed pawn on the a-file if the a-pawn advances. Black's kingside pawns are advanced, but White can try to activate the king or create a passed pawn on the kingside.\n\nLegal moves:\n- King moves: f2g2, f2e2, f2g1, f2f1, f2e1\n- Pawn moves: a3a4, h2h3, h2h4\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. a3a4: This challenges Black's queenside pawns and could create a passed pawn if Black captures.\n2. h2h3 or h2h4: These moves try to break up Black's kingside pawns, but Black's king is close and could support a pawn break.\n3. King moves: f2g2, f2e2, etc. These are mostly waiting moves, but could prepare to support the kingside.\n\nLet's evaluate a3a4:\n- If ...bxa4, then White can play Ke3 and try to win the a-pawn later, or b5-b6 to create a passed pawn.\n- If ...g4, White can play h3, and if ...gxh3, then Kf3 and White's king is active.\n\nLet's evaluate h2h3:\n- If ...gxh3, then Kf3 and White's king is active.\n- If ...g3+, then Kf1 and Black has no immediate breakthrough.\n\nLet's evaluate h2h4:\n- If ...gxh4, then Kg2 and White's king is active.\n- If ...g4, then Kg2 and White can try to attack the g4 pawn.\n\nBetween a3a4 and h2h3/h2h4, a3a4 seems to be the most promising, as it challenges Black's queenside and could create a passed pawn.\n\nFinal move:\n```\na3a4\n```"
