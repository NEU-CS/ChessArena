When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's bishop on b3 is also well-placed.\n- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed, but not under immediate threat.\n- Black's queen is on b2, very active and pressuring White's queenside and second rank.\n- Black's bishop on e7 is solid, and the knight on d5 is central.\n- Black's rook is on c8.\n\n**Immediate Threats:**\n- White threatens to play Qxb7, attacking the rook on c8 and possibly the bishop on e7.\n- White's g4-g5 could open lines against Black's king.\n- Black's queen on b2 is attacking a2 and could swing to the kingside.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. **c8c6**: Defends b7, keeps the rook active, and prepares to double on the c-file or support the knight.\n2. **c8c7**: Defends b7, but less active than c6.\n3. **d5c7**: Retreats the knight, but loses central control.\n4. **b2b3**: Attacks the bishop on b3, but White can play Qxb7.\n5. **b2d4**: Centralizes the queen, but White can play exd4.\n6. **h7h6**: Gives luft, but doesn't address the threat to b7.\n7. **e6e5**: Kicks the knight, but White can play Nf5.\n\n**Best Move Analysis:**\n- The most urgent threat is Qxb7, attacking the rook and bishop.\n- c8c6 directly defends b7 and keeps the rook on the active c-file.\n- After c8c6, if Qxb7, then Rb6 traps the queen (since the queen on b7 has no escape squares).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- 25...c8c6\n  - 26. Qxb7 Rb6\n    - The queen is trapped! The only square is Qxa7, then Ra6, and the queen is lost.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to defend b7 and set a trap for the White queen.\n\n```\nc8c6\n```"
