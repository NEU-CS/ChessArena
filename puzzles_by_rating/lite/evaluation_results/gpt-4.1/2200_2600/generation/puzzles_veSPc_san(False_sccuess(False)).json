When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This relieves pressure but loses a piece for Black.\n2. **d7b5** (Bb5): Attacks the queen, but White can play Qd2 or Qg3.\n3. **b4e1** (Qe1+): Gives check, but White can block with Qf1 or Kh2.\n4. **b4e4** (Qxe4): Captures the knight, but after Qxe4, White's queen is very active.\n5. **b4c3** (Qc3): Attacks the queen and knight, but White can play Qxc3.\n6. **b4b7** (Qb7): Retreats, but passive.\n7. **g7g6**: Creates luft for the king, but not urgent.\n8. **f7f5**: Gains space, but weakens e6.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- The knight on e4 is defended by the queen and knight.\n- The knight on c4 is only defended by the queen.\n- If Black plays Qc3, White can play Qxc3, and after Nxc3, Black has a knight for a queen, which is not good.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **b4e4** (Qxe4): This wins a knight, as the queen on d3 is overloaded. If White recaptures with Qxe4, Black can play Rxe4, and after Qxe4, Rxe4, Black wins a piece. If White plays Qxe4, Rxe4, Nxd6, Black can play Re7, defending the bishop and keeping material advantage.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb4e4\n```"
