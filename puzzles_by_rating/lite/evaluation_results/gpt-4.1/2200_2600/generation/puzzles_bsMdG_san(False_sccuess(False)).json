When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The king is not under immediate threat, but moving away from the center could allow White's king to penetrate or support pawn advances. Not optimal unless necessary.\n\n2. **f7f6**: Supports the g5 pawn and prepares to meet e6 with f5-f4. However, it also blocks the king's retreat and doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n3. **a6a5**: Advances the queenside pawn majority. However, White can respond with bxa5, and after ...b4, White can play Ke3-d4 and target the queenside pawns.\n\n4. **g5g4**: Advances the kingside pawns, attacking White's h3 pawn. If White plays hxg4, then f4+ forks the king and g2 pawn, and Black can create a passed pawn.\n\n5. **f5f4**: Immediately attacks the White king and tries to open lines. However, White can play Kxf4, and after g5-g4, hxg4, Black doesn't have enough to break through.\n\n**Critical calculation:**\n\n- **g5g4**: If hxg4, then f4+ forks the king and g2 pawn. If Kxf4, then f4 opens the f-file and Black can try to push the h-pawn.\n\nLet's look deeper into **g5g4**:\n\n1. g5g4\n   - a) hxg4 f4+ (King must move, then fxg3, Black has a dangerous passed pawn)\n   - b) Kf4 (then f4, White must decide between exf6+ or d6+)\n   - c) hxg4 fxg4+ Ke3 (or Kf2), then Black has a passed g-pawn and can try to push it.\n\nThis move creates the most immediate problems for White and gives Black the best chance to create a passed pawn and counterplay.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5g4\n```"
