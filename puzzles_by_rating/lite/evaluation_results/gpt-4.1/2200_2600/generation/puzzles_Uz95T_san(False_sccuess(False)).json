When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is on f1, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's queen and bishop are active, and the knight on e5 is centralized.\n\n**Threats:**\n- White threatens fxe5, attacking the knight and opening lines.\n- Black has pressure on e4 and f4, and the queen is well-placed on g7.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. ...h4h3 (pawn push, trying to open the h-file)\n2. ...e5g4 (knight jump, attacking e3 and f2)\n3. ...e5f3 (knight jump, threatening mate on g2)\n4. ...g6g5 (pawn push, supporting h4 and gaining space)\n5. ...e8g8 (castling kingside)\n6. ...a8d8 (centralizing rook)\n7. ...b7e4 (bishop takes pawn, attacking queen and rook)\n\n**Tactical Considerations:**\n- ...e5f3 is very tempting: if White plays gxf3, then ...Qg2# is mate. If White plays Qxf3, then ...Qxd4 wins a bishop.\n- ...e5f3 is a direct threat, and White cannot capture the knight without getting mated.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. ...e5f3\n   - If White plays Qxf3, then ...Qxd4 wins a bishop.\n   - If White plays gxf3, then ...Qg2# is mate.\n   - If White plays Bxg7, then ...Nxh2+ and Black is winning.\n   - If White plays h3, then ...Nxd4 wins a bishop.\n\nThis move is crushing and threatens mate. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5f3\n```"
