When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black plays Kxe6, White can try to use the king to support the queenside pawns.\n2. b3b4: Challenge Black's queenside pawns immediately. If Black captures, White can recapture and try to create a passed pawn.\n3. e3f4: Move the king towards the center/queenside, possibly to support pawn advances.\n4. e3d3: King move, but doesn't seem to improve White's position much.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **e5e6:** If Black plays Kxe6, White can play Kd4, attacking the b5 pawn. If Black plays Kxe6, then Kd4, and after b4, White can play Kc5, threatening to take on b5 and then a5. This could lead to a winning king and pawn endgame for White.\n- **b3b4:** If Black plays axb4, White can play Kd4, and if b4, White can play Kd4 and then try to win the b5 pawn.\n- **e3f4:** This move doesn't immediately threaten anything and is slower than pushing the e-pawn.\n\n**Best move:**\nPushing the e-pawn to e6 is the most direct and forces Black to respond. It creates immediate problems for Black and gives White a clear plan.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5e6\n```"
