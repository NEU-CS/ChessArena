When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is also active, while Black's king is somewhat centralized. Black's knight on b5 is blocking the a-pawn for now.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. b5c7: Move the knight to c7, directly blocking the a-pawn. However, White can play Kc5, attacking the knight and threatening to push the pawn.\n2. b5a7: Move the knight to a7, also blocking the pawn, but White can play Kc5 and then Kb6, threatening to push the pawn.\n3. b5d6+: Check the White king. If Kd5, then Nc8, but White can play Kc6 and a7.\n4. e7d6: Move the king closer to the queenside, but White can play Kxb5, capturing the knight.\n5. h7h6 or g7g6: Pawn moves on the kingside are too slow and do not address the immediate threat.\n\nThe most pressing issue is the a6 pawn. The best way to stop it is to keep the knight on b5 for now and bring the king closer to support the knight and stop the pawn.\n\ne7d6 is a strong candidate, as it brings the king closer to the queenside and keeps the knight on b5, blocking the pawn. If White plays Kxb5, then Nc7, and the pawn is blocked. If White plays Kd5, then Nc7, and the pawn is still blocked.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne7d6\n```"
