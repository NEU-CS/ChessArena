When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is on h8, somewhat boxed in, but the knight on e3 is strong, and Black's queen on c8 covers the 8th rank.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- a7a8: Queen to a8, but Black's queen covers the 8th rank.\n- a7g7: Queen to g7, threatening mate, but the pawn on g7 blocks.\n- a7f7: Queen to f7, threatening mate, but pawn on f5 blocks.\n- a7e7: Queen to e7, threatening mate, but pawn on e4 blocks.\n- a7b8: Queen to b8, attacking the queen.\n- h4h5: Pawn push, opening lines.\n- d4d5: Pawn push, attacking the knight and opening the bishop.\n- g2e4: Bishop takes pawn, but the knight on e3 covers.\n- g3g4: Pawn push, attacking f5.\n- a3a4: Pawn push, supporting b5 square.\n- b2b3/b2b4: Pawn pushes.\n\nTactical ideas:\n- The Black king is boxed in, but the knight on e3 is a strong defender.\n- If White can open the g-file or h-file, there may be mating threats.\n- The queen on a7 is very active, but needs to coordinate with the bishop.\n\nCritical move:  \nd4d5 attacks the knight on e3, and if the knight moves, White can play Qxg7# (if the g7 pawn is not defended). Also, d4d5 opens the diagonal for the bishop on g2, which may be useful for future threats.\n\nLet's check d4d5:\n- If ...Nxd5, then Qxg7# is not possible, but the knight is off e3.\n- If ...Qd8, defending g7, White can continue to press.\n- If ...Nxg2, White can play Kxg2, and the king is safer.\n\nAlternatively, h4h5 is a slow move, and Black can respond with ...Nxg2.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd4d5\n```"
