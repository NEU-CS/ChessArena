When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If king takes, Qg4+ picks up the queen.\n5. g4g5: Queen stays on the g-file, but doesn't threaten much.\n6. d4b6: Bishop attacks f2, but not decisive.\n7. h6h7: Prepares h4, but too slow.\n\nLet's check the forcing lines:\n\n**1. g4h3+**\n- If Kxh3, then Qf1+ picks up the queen after Kh4.\n- If Kg1, then Qd1+ and Qg1+ ideas, but White can block.\n- If Kf3, then Qg4+ wins the queen.\n\n**2. g4e4**\n- Attacks knight, but White can play f3 or f4.\n\n**3. g4e6**\n- Attacks knight, but not forcing.\n\n**4. g4f5**\n- Threatens mate on f2, but White can defend.\n\n**5. g4h4**\n- Threatens Qh2+, but White can play Qxh4.\n\n**6. g4g3+**\n- If hxg3, then Bxf2, but White can defend.\n\n**Best move:**\nThe most forcing move is **g4h3+**. If White takes with the king, Black can continue with Qg4+ and pick up the queen. If White moves the king, Black can continue the attack.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng4h3\n```"
