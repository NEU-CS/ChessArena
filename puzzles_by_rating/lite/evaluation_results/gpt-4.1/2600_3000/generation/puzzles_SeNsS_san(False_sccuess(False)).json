When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let's see the possible responses:\n     - Kf4xf3: White's king takes the queen, but then Black can play hxg4+ and White's king is exposed.\n     - If White plays Kd4xf3, same as above.\n     - If White blocks with Qxf3, Black wins the queen for queen.\n   - But after Qxf3+, White can take with the queen or king. If king takes, Black can play hxg4+ and the king is very exposed.\n   - Let's look at the line:\n     - 1... Qxf3+ 2. Kxf3 hxg4+ 3. Kxg4 (forced) Ra4+ 4. Kg5 Kg7 (or f6+)\n     - But after 3... Ra4+, White can play Kg5, and Black can try f6+.\n\n2. **Qg2e4+**  \n   - 1... Qe4+ 2. fxe4 (forced) hxg4 (threatening mate on h3)\n   - But after 2. fxe4, Black loses the queen for a pawn.\n\n3. **Qg2xg4**  \n   - Captures a pawn, but White's queen and rook are still active.\n\n4. **Ra3xf3**  \n   - 1... Rxf3 2. Kxf3 Qxg4+ 3. Ke3 Qg5+ 4. Kd3 Qxd5+ and Black is winning.\n\nLet's check this line in detail:\n\n**1... Rxf3!**\n- If 2. Kxf3, then 2... Qxg4+ 3. Ke3 Qg5+ 4. Kd3 Qxd5+ and Black wins the queen and the game.\n- If 2. gxf3, then 2... Qxd2 and Black wins the rook.\n- If 2. Kd4, then 2... Qxg4+ and Black is winning.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**1... Rxf3** is a crushing move, winning material and exposing the White king to a decisive attack.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\na3f3\n```"
