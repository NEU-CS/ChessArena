When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n5r2/8/P4p2/3R4/3pP2n/1B1Pk3/1PP3rP/5K2 b - - 0 35\n\n**Black to move.**\n\n### Material Count\n- **Black:** Rook (f8), Rook (g2), Knight (h4), Pawns (f6, d4)\n- **White:** Rook (d5), Bishop (b3), King (f1), Pawns (a6, c2, b2, e4, h2)\n\n### Immediate Threats\n- White has a dangerous passed pawn on a6, but it's not immediately queening.\n- White's rook on d5 is active, but not threatening an immediate mate or capture.\n- Black's rook on g2 is very active, attacking the second rank and potentially threatening g1+.\n- Black's knight on h4 is menacing, especially with the White king exposed.\n- Black's rook on f8 is on an open file.\n\n### Candidate Moves\nLet's look at the legal moves:\n\n- **Rook moves:** f8h8, f8g8, f8e8, f8d8, f8c8, f8b8, f8a8, f8f7\n- **Knight moves:** h4g6, h4f5, h4f3\n- **King moves:** e3f4, e3f3, e3d2\n- **Rook g2 moves:** g2g8, g2g7, g2g6, g2g5, g2g4, g2g3, g2h2, g2f2, g2e2, g2d2, g2c2, g2g1\n- **Pawn move:** f6f5\n\n#### Let's check for tactics and threats:\n\n#### 1. **Rook g2-g1+**\n- If 1...g2g1+, White must respond with 2.Kxg1 (forced).\n- Then Black can play 2...Nf3+ forking king and rook, but the king is on g1, so after 3.Kf2, Black can take the rook on d5 with the knight, but that's not possible because the knight is too far.\n- Alternatively, after 1...g2g1+, 2.Kxg1, Black can play Nf3+ and after 3.Kf2, Nxh2, but that's not very convincing.\n\n#### 2. **Rook g2xc2**\n- 1...g2c2 attacks the bishop on b3 and the pawn on b2.\n- But after 2.Bxc2, Black loses the rook.\n\n#### 3. **Knight h4-f3**\n- 1...h4f3 threatens a fork on d2 and e1, but the king is on f1.\n- Let's see: 1...Nf3, White can play 2.Rf5 (threatening Rxf3), or 2.Kf2, but then Black can play Rg1, but the king is not on g1.\n\n#### 4. **King moves**\n- e3f4, e3f3, e3d2: All expose the king and don't seem safe.\n\n#### 5. **Rook f8-f7**\n- 1...f8f7 doubles rooks on the 7th, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n\n#### 6. **Pawn f6-f5**\n- 1...f6f5 opens up the king, but doesn't create a threat.\n\n#### 7. **Rook f8-d8**\n- 1...f8d8 attacks the rook on d5, but White can just exchange.\n\n#### 8. **Knight h4-g6**\n- 1...Ng6 attacks the e5 square, but doesn't create a threat.\n\n#### 9. **Rook g2-h2**\n- 1...g2h2 attacks the h2 pawn, but it's already protected.\n\n### Let's look for forced tactics:\n\n#### **1...Rg1+**\n- 1...g2g1+ 2.Kxg1 Nf3+ 3.Kf2 Nxh2\n- Black wins a pawn, but White's a-pawn is still dangerous.\n\n#### **1...Nf3**\n- 1...h4f3 2.Rf5 (threatening Rxf3) Rg1+ 3.Ke2 (if Kf2, then Rg2+ and repeat) Rg2+ 4.Kxf3 Rf2+ 5.Kg3 Rxf5\n- This line is complicated, but Black seems to be getting material.\n\n#### **1...Rg1+ is the most forcing move.**\n\nLet's check the consequences:\n\n1...g2g1+  \n2.Kxg1 Nf3+  \n3.Kf2 Nxh2\n\nNow Black has won a pawn and the knight is attacking the rook on d5. White's a6 pawn is still dangerous, but Black's pieces are very active.\n\n#### Is there a better move?\n\nWhat about 1...Rg2xc2?\n- 1...g2c2 2.Bxc2, Black loses the rook.\n\nWhat about 1...Nf3?\n- 1...h4f3 2.Rf5 (threatening Rxf3) Rg1+ 3.Ke2 Rg2+ 4.Kxf3 Rf2+ 5.Kg3 Rxf5, Black wins the rook for two pieces, but White's a-pawn is still dangerous.\n\n#### **Conclusion:**\nThe most forcing and best move is **1...Rg1+** (g2g1+), as it forces the White king to capture, and then Black gets Nf3+ with a fork and picks up the h2 pawn, activating the knight and gaining material.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng2g1\n```"
