When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let's see how Black can respond:\n     - If Rxg8, then White can play Rh1# (mate).\n     - If Kxg8, not possible (king on h8, can't move to g8).\n     - If Qxg8, then White can play Rh1+ and after Qh7, Qxh7# (mate).\n   - Let's check this line in detail:\n     - 1. Qg8+ Rxg8 (forced)\n     - 2. Rh1+ Qh7 (forced, only way to block)\n     - 3. Qxh7#\n\nThis is a forced mate in 3.\n\n2. **e6e8** (Qe6-e8+):  \n   - This is a check, but Black can block with Rf8 or Qg8, and it's not as forcing as Qg8+.\n\n3. **Other checks:**  \n   - e6g6 (Qe6-g6+): Black can block with Qh7 or Qg7, not as forcing.\n\n**Other moves:**  \n- None of the other moves are as forcing as Qg8+.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is **e6g8** (Qe6-g8+), leading to a forced mate in 3.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne6g8\n```"
