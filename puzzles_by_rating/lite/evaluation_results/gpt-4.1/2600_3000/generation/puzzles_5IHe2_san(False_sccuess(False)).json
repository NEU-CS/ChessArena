When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n3r2k1/5p2/p1Q3p1/5b2/P1Br2p1/1P5P/3q1P2/R3R1K1 w - - 0 29\n\n**White to move.**\n\n### 1. Material Count\n\n- **White:** Queen (c6), Rook (a1, e1), Bishop (c4), Pawns (a4, b3, f2, h3)\n- **Black:** Queen (d2), Rook (d8), Bishop (f5), Pawns (a6, f7, g3, g4)\n\nWhite is up the exchange (two rooks vs rook and bishop) and has a queen vs queen. Black has a dangerous passed pawn on g3 and some pressure, but White's queen is very active.\n\n### 2. King Safety\n\n- **White King:** g1, relatively safe but could be exposed if Black's queen and rook coordinate.\n- **Black King:** g8, somewhat exposed, especially with White's queen and bishop eyeing the kingside.\n\n### 3. Threats\n\n- **Black Threats:** The g3 pawn is close to queening, but White can control it. Black's queen on d2 is active.\n- **White Threats:** White's queen is very active on c6, and the bishop on c4 is eyeing f7 and g8. The rook on e1 can swing to the e-file.\n\n### 4. Candidate Moves\n\nLet's look at the most forcing moves first:\n\n#### a) **e1e8** (Rook to e8, check)\n\n- If ...Rxe8, then Qxe8+ Kg7 Qxf7+ Kh6 Qf8+ Kg5 h4+! and White is winning.\n- If ...Kg7, then Qf6+! and Black is in big trouble.\n\n#### b) **c6e8** (Queen to e8, check)\n\n- ...Rxe8, then Rxe8+ Kg7 Qxf7+ Kh6 Qf8+ Kg5 h4+ and White is winning.\n\n#### c) **c6e4** (Queen to e4, threatening Qe8+)\n\n- Not as forcing as the direct checks.\n\n#### d) **c4f7** (Bishop takes f7+, check)\n\n- ...Kg7, then Qc3+ (or Qc7) and White is pressing.\n\n#### e) **c6g6** (Queen to g6, check)\n\n- ...Bxg6, then hxg4 and White is up material.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Forcing Line: **e1e8**\n\nLet's check the main line:\n\n1. **e1e8+** Rxe8 (forced)\n2. Qxe8+ Kg7 (forced)\n3. Qxf7+ Kh6 (forced)\n4. Qf8+ Kg5 (forced)\n5. h4+! Kxh4 (forced)\n6. Qh6+ Qxh6 (forced)\n7. Bf1 (threatening mate on h6)\n\nBut after 7...Qf4, White is still winning.\n\nAlternatively, after 5. h4+ Kh5, White can play Qh8# if the bishop is not on f5.\n\n### 6. Checking for Immediate Mate\n\nIs there a mate in one or two?\n\n- **e1e8+** is the most forcing and seems to lead to a decisive attack.\n\n### 7. Final Evaluation\n\n**e1e8** is the most forcing move, leading to a decisive attack and likely checkmate or winning significant material.\n\n---\n\n## Final Move\n\n```\ne1e8\n```"
