When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This does not address the mate threat; Qg6# is still mate.\n\n#### 2. **f4g6**\n- Knight moves to g6. This blocks the g6 square, preventing Qg6#. This is a critical defensive resource.\n\n#### 3. **f4h5**\n- Knight to h5. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 4. **f4d5**\n- Knight to d5. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 5. **f4h3**\n- Knight to h3. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 6. **f4g2**\n- Knight to g2. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 7. **f4e2**\n- Knight to e2. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 8. **d3g6**\n- Queen to g6. Blocks the mate, but White can capture with the rook or queen.\n\n#### 9. **d3h7**\n- Queen to h7. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 10. **d3d6**\n- Queen to d6. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 11. **d3f5**\n- Queen to f5. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 12. **d3d5**\n- Queen to d5. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 13. **d3e4**\n- Queen to e4. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 14. **d3d4**\n- Queen to d4. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 15. **d3c4**\n- Queen to c4. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 16. **d3e3**\n- Queen to e3. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 17. **d3c3**\n- Queen to c3. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 18. **d3e2**\n- Queen to e2. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 19. **d3d2**\n- Queen to d2. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 20. **d3c2**\n- Queen to c2. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 21. **d3f1**\n- Queen to f1. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 22. **d3d1**\n- Queen to d1. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 23. **d3b1**\n- Queen to b1. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 24. **h6h5**\n- Pawn to h5. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 25. **e6e5**\n- Pawn to e5. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 26. **a6a5**\n- Pawn to a5. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 27. **b5b4**\n- Pawn to b4. Does not prevent Qg6#.\n\n#### 28. **a8h8, a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8, a8a7**\n- Rook moves. None of these prevent Qg6#.\n\n### Conclusion\n**Only the move f4g6 (Nf4-g6) prevents the immediate mate on g6.**  \nOther moves either do not address the threat or lose material without preventing mate.\n\n### Double-checking f4g6\n- After f4g6, if White plays Qxg6, Black can recapture with hxg6.\n- If White plays Rg3+, Black can play Kxh4 or Kf5, but needs to be careful.\n\nBut **f4g6** is the only move that avoids immediate checkmate.\n\n### Final Move\n```\nf4g6\n```"
