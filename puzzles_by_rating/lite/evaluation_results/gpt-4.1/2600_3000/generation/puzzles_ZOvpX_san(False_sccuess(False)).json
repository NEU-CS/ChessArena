It is more precise than b3b4 because it keeps all options open and ensures the king is optimally placed.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nd3c3\n```"

Not optimal.\n\n### 3. **c3c2** (King to c2)\n- King steps back, away from the action. Not optimal.\n\n### 4. **c3b2** (King to b2)\n- King moves toward the queenside, possibly to support a4 and b3, but not as active as staying central.\n\n### 5. **b3b4** (Pawn to b4)\n- This is a critical move. By playing b4, White challenges Black's a5 and c5 pawns.\n- If Black captures with cxb4+, White can recapture with the king (c3xb4), and the king is active on the queenside.\n- If Black captures with axb4+, White can recapture with the king (c3xb4), again activating the king.\n- If Black does not capture, White can play bxc5 next, creating a passed pawn.\n- This move forces the issue on the queenside and gives White a chance to create a passed pawn, which is critical in king and pawn endgames.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Move:**\n\n**b3b4** is the best move. It creates immediate tension on the queenside, and White's king is ideally placed to support pawn breakthroughs. The other king moves are too passive or do not create threats.\n\n**Final answer:**\n```\nb3b4\n```"
