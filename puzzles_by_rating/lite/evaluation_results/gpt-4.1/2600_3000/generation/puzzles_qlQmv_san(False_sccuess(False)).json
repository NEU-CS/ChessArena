When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \n1. h6h7 (King from h6 to h7)\n2. h6g6 (King from h6 to g6)\n3. h6h5 (King from h6 to h5)\n4. g7g5 (Pawn from g7 to g5)\n\nLet's look at the board:\n\n- Black king is on h6.\n- White's queen is on f4, threatening mate ideas.\n- White's bishop is on b2, pawn on a3, c3, b2, g2, f2, king on g3.\n- Black's rook is on a8, pawn on a7, b7, g7, queen on d1.\n- White has a passed pawn on the queenside.\n- Black is down a lot of material and is under heavy attack.\n\nLet's analyze each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. h6h7\n\nMove king to h7.  \n- White can play Qf5+ (check), and after g6, Qh3+ wins the queen on d1 or leads to mate.\n- The king is still exposed.\n\n### 2. h6g6\n\nMove king to g6.  \n- White can play Qf7+ (check), and after Kh6, Qg6# is mate.\n- If after Kg5, Qxg7 is mate.\n- This move walks into a check and likely mate.\n\n### 3. h6h5\n\nMove king to h5.  \n- White can play Qf5+ (check), and after Kh4, Qh3# is mate.\n- This move walks into immediate mate.\n\n### 4. g7g5\n\nMove pawn from g7 to g5.  \n- This blocks the queen's access to f5 and h5, so it prevents immediate checks.\n- White can still try Qf6+, but after Kh7, there is no immediate mate.\n- This is the only move that does not lose immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**g7g5** is the only move that does not lose immediately. All king moves walk into forced mate or loss of the queen.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng7g5\n```"
