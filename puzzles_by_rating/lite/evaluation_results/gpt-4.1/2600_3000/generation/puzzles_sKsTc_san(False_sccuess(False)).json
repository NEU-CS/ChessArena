When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \ne6e7, e6d7, f7f6, b6b5, a6a5, c5c4, d4d3, f7f5\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n- **Material:** Equal pawns, no pieces.\n- **King activity:** Both kings are active, but White's king is more centralized.\n- **Pawn structure:** Both sides have passed pawns and potential for pawn breakthroughs.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate each move**\n\n1. **e6e7:** Pushes the king pawn, but White's king can easily stop it (Ke3-d2-e2).\n2. **e6d7:** Retreats the king, passive.\n3. **f7f6:** Supports g5, but doesn't create a direct threat.\n4. **b6b5:** Pushes the b-pawn, but White can respond with a5, locking the queenside.\n5. **a6a5:** Similar to b6b5, but White can respond with b4, locking the queenside.\n6. **c5c4:** Advances the c-pawn, but White can play bxc4, opening the b-file for White's king.\n7. **d4d3:** Pushes the d-pawn, creating a dangerous passed pawn. If White captures (cxd3), Black can recapture with the king (Kxd3), activating the king and threatening to invade.\n8. **f7f5:** Pushes the f-pawn, but White can respond with gxf5+, opening the g-file for White's king.\n\n**Step 2: Candidate moves**\n\nThe most promising move is **d4d3**. This creates a dangerous passed pawn and forces White to respond. If White ignores it, Black can play d2 and promote. If White captures, Black's king becomes more active.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate lines after d4d3**\n\n- If White plays cxd3, Black plays Kxd3, and the king is very active.\n- If White ignores and plays c4, Black plays d2, and the pawn is close to promotion.\n- If White plays Kxd3, Black can play Kxe5, winning the e5 pawn.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with other moves**\n\nOther pawn pushes (b6b5, a6a5, c5c4, f7f6, f7f5) do not create immediate threats or improve Black's position as much as d4d3.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**d4d3** is the best move, creating a dangerous passed pawn and activating the king.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nd4d3\n```"
