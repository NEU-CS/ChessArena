When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n8/8/3p3p/p2P4/Pp1k2P1/1P2p3/2B2b1P/5K2 w - - 0 50\n\n**White to move.**\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: King (f1), Bishop (c2), pawns (a4, b3, d5, g4, h2)\n- Black: King (d4), Bishop (f2), pawns (a5, b4, d6, e3, h6)\n\n**Legal moves:**\n- c2h7 (Bishop to h7)\n- c2g6 (Bishop to g6)\n- c2f5 (Bishop to f5)\n- c2e4 (Bishop to e4)\n- c2d3 (Bishop to d3)\n- c2d1 (Bishop to d1)\n- c2b1 (Bishop to b1)\n- f1g2 (King to g2)\n- f1e2 (King to e2)\n- g4g5 (Pawn to g5)\n- h2h3 (Pawn to h3)\n- h2h4 (Pawn to h4)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate threats and priorities\n\n- Black's king is active on d4.\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on e3, supported by the king.\n- White's king is far from the action.\n- White's bishop is on c2, can be active.\n- White's pawns on the queenside are blockaded.\n- Black's bishop on f2 is supporting the e3 pawn and controls the long diagonal.\n\n### Step 2: Candidate moves\n\nLet's consider the most forcing moves first:\n\n#### 1. Bishop moves\n- **c2h7**: Attacks the h6 pawn, but doesn't change the situation much.\n- **c2g6**: Attacks the e4 square, but not much impact.\n- **c2f5**: Attacks the e3 pawn, but the bishop can be captured by the king (d4xf5).\n- **c2e4**: Attacks the king, but the king can capture the bishop (d4xe4).\n- **c2d3**: Attacks the king, but the king can capture the bishop (d4xd3).\n- **c2d1, c2b1**: Retreats, passive.\n\n#### 2. King moves\n- **f1g2, f1e2**: King steps up, but doesn't impact the immediate situation.\n\n#### 3. Pawn moves\n- **g4g5**: Attacks the h6 pawn, but Black can respond with hxg5 or h5.\n- **h2h3, h2h4**: Slow, doesn't change much.\n\n### Step 3: Tactics and threats\n\n- Black's e3 pawn is two steps from queening and supported by the bishop.\n- White's bishop is under threat if it moves to f5, e4, or d3.\n- White's king is too far to help on the queenside or center.\n- White's only hope is to create counterplay on the kingside.\n\n#### Let's check **g4g5**:\n\n- If **g4g5**, Black can respond with hxg5, but then White can play h2h4, trying to open the h-file and create a passed pawn.\n- If **g4g5** and Black plays h5, White can play h2h3, but Black's e3 pawn is still dangerous.\n\n#### Let's check **c2h7**:\n\n- Bishop attacks h6, but Black can ignore and push e2+, threatening to queen.\n- After c2h7, e2+, Kxf2, Kd3, and Black's king is very active.\n\n### Step 4: Best move\n\nGiven the analysis, **g4g5** is the most active move, trying to open lines on the kingside and create counterplay. All bishop moves either lose the bishop or are too passive. King moves are too slow.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\ng4g5\n```"
