When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \ne2d3, e2f2, e2d2, e2f1, e2e1, g5f3\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n- **Material:**  \n  White: Queen, two rooks, two knights, 5 pawns, king  \n  Black: Queen, two rooks, bishop, 5 pawns, king\n\n- **King safety:**  \n  White's king is on e2, somewhat exposed.  \n  Black's king is on e8, not castled, but not under immediate threat.\n\n- **Threats:**  \n  Black's queen on g4 is very active, threatening Ne3+ (forking king and queen if White's king moves to d3 or d2).  \n  Black's knight on e5 is centralized and dangerous.  \n  White's queen is on b3, not immediately threatening anything.  \n  White's knight on g5 is attacked by the queen and could be retreated.\n\n- **Legal moves:**  \n  1. e2d3 (King to d3)\n  2. e2f2 (King to f2)\n  3. e2d2 (King to d2)\n  4. e2f1 (King to f1)\n  5. e2e1 (King to e1)\n  6. g5f3 (Knight to f3)\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. e2d3 (King to d3)\n- This puts the king on a dark square, but Black can play Ne3, forking king and queen.\n- After Ne3, White loses the queen.\n- **Bad move.**\n\n### 2. e2f2 (King to f2)\n- King moves to f2, but then Black can play fxe4, opening the f-file and threatening Qf3+.\n- Also, the king is exposed.\n- Not ideal, but not an immediate loss.\n\n### 3. e2d2 (King to d2)\n- King to d2, Black can play Ne3, forking king and queen.\n- **Bad move.**\n\n### 4. e2f1 (King to f1)\n- King to f1, Black can play Ne3+, forking king and queen.\n- **Bad move.**\n\n### 5. e2e1 (King to e1)\n- King to e1, Black can play Nf3+, forking king and queen.\n- **Bad move.**\n\n### 6. g5f3 (Knight to f3)\n- Retreats the knight, blocks the g-file, and covers e1 and e3.\n- After this, Black can play Nxf3, but then White can recapture with the queen (Qxf3).\n- This move also blocks any checks on the e-file and covers the king.\n- **This is the only move that doesn't lose material immediately.**\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**The best move is:**\n```\ng5f3\n```\nThis move prevents immediate tactical losses and keeps White in the game. All king moves lose the queen to a fork."
