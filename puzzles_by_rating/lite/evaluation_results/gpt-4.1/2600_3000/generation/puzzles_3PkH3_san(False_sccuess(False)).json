When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n8/5pkp/5qp1/p2Q4/Pb4P1/2p1R2P/5P1K/8 w - - 0 35\n\n**White to move.**\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: Queen (d5), Rook (e3), 4 pawns (a4, g4, h3, f2), King (h2)\n- Black: Queen (f6), Bishop (b4), 4 pawns (a5, c3, g7, h7), King (g7)\n\n**Immediate tactical threats:**\n- Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's queen and bishop are active, but White's queen is extremely powerful on d5.\n- White's rook is on e3, ready to swing.\n- White's queen can check on several squares.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\nLet's look for forcing moves first: checks, captures, threats.\n\n### 1. Checks\n\n- **d5d8** (Qd8+): Queen check on the back rank.\n    - Black must play Qxd8 (forced), then White can recapture with Rxd8, but then Black plays c2 and the c-pawn is dangerous.\n- **d5f7** (Qf7+): Queen check on f7.\n    - Black can only play Qxf7 (forced), then White can play Re7, but Black is up a piece.\n- **d5d7** (Qd7+): Queen check on d7.\n    - Black can play Be7, blocking.\n- **d5b7** (Qb7+): Queen check on b7.\n    - Black can play Be7, blocking.\n- **d5g2** (Qg2+): Queen check on g2.\n    - Black king goes to g8 or h6, but not very forcing.\n\n### 2. Captures\n\n- **d5b4** (Qxb4): Queen takes bishop, but c3 pawn is still dangerous.\n- **e3e8** (Re8): Rook to e8, not a capture, but attacks the queen and threatens mate on g8 if the queen moves.\n\n### 3. Threats\n\n- **e3e8** (Re8): This move threatens Qf8# if the queen moves, and also attacks the queen on f6.\n    - If Black plays Qd6 (blocking), White can play Qxd6, cxd6, and then Re7+ wins the bishop and the game.\n    - If Black plays Qf4+ (check), White can play Kg2, and there are no more checks.\n    - If Black plays Qb6, White can play Qxf7+ and then Qf8#.\n\n### 4. Other moves\n\n- **g4g5**: Pawn push, not forcing.\n- **f2f4**: Pawn push, not forcing.\n\n### Let's calculate **e3e8** in detail:\n\n#### 1. e3e8\n\n- White plays **Re8**, attacking the queen and threatening mate on g8.\n- Black's queen is attacked and must move.\n    - If **Qd6** (blocking), then Qxd6, cxd6, Re7+ wins.\n    - If **Qb6**, then Qxf7+ Kh6 Qf8+ Kg5 f4# is mate.\n    - If **Qf4+**, then Kg2, and Black has no more checks.\n\n#### 2. d5d8\n\n- White plays **Qd8+**, Black must play Qxd8, White plays Re8, Black plays c2, and the c-pawn is dangerous.\n\n#### 3. d5f7\n\n- White plays **Qf7+**, Black must play Qxf7, White plays Re7, but Black is up a piece.\n\n#### 4. d5b4\n\n- White plays **Qxb4**, but c2 is coming.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**e3e8** is the strongest move. It threatens mate and wins material. Black cannot defend against both the mate threat and the attack on the queen.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne3e8\n```"
