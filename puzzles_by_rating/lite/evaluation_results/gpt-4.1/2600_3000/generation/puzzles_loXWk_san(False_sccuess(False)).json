When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:** c5d6, c5c6, c5d4, c5c4\n\n**Material count:**\n- Black: King (c5), pawns (a6, b6, h5)\n- White: King (f4), pawns (a3, b4, c4, h4), knight (g6)\n\n**Positional assessment:**\n- White is up a knight and has a strong pawn majority on the queenside.\n- Black's king is somewhat active but is outnumbered in material.\n- Black's only hope is to activate the king and try to create counterplay with the pawns, but realistically, White should be winning.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n1. **c5d6:** King moves toward the center, possibly heading for the queenside pawns.\n2. **c5c6:** King steps back, more passive.\n3. **c5d4:** King moves toward the center and attacks the c4 pawn.\n4. **c5c4:** King advances, attacking the b4 pawn.\n\n**Candidate move analysis:**\n\n- **c5d6:** Moves king toward the center, but White's king and knight are well placed to stop any pawn advances. White can continue pushing queenside pawns.\n- **c5c6:** Passive, doesn't challenge White's position.\n- **c5d4:** Attacks c4 pawn. If White ignores, Black can capture c4, but White can defend with king or knight, or push b5.\n- **c5c4:** Attacks b4 pawn. If White plays b5, Black can play axb5, and after cxb5, Black's king is cut off from the queenside. If White ignores, Black can capture b4.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n\n- After **c5d4**:\n  - If White plays b5, Black can play axb5, and after cxb5, Black's king is still active.\n  - If White plays c5, Black can play bxc5, and White's queenside pawns are less dangerous.\n  - If White plays Nf5+, Black can play Kc3, and after Ke4, Black can try to hold the position.\n\n- After **c5c4**:\n  - If White plays b5, Black can play axb5, cxb5+ Kxb5, and Black's king is active, but White's knight and king are close.\n  - If White plays Nf5, Black can play Kb3, but White's king and knight can coordinate to win.\n\n**Best move:**\n\n**c5d4** is the most active and challenging move. It attacks the c4 pawn and forces White to respond. It keeps the king centralized and maximizes Black's chances for counterplay, even though the position is still lost with best play from White.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nc5d4\n```"
