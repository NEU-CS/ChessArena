When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black can block with the knight (Kb7), but the king can escape.\n- g7g6 (Qg6+): Queen check on g6. Black can block with the knight (Kb7), but not very forcing.\n- g7f6 (Qf6+): Queen check on f6. Black can block with the knight (Kb7), but not very forcing.\n- g7g8 (Qg8+): Queen check on g8. Black can block with the rook (Kb7), but not very forcing.\n- g7e5 (Qe5+): Queen check on e5. Black can block with the knight (Kb7), but not very forcing.\n- c2h7 (Bxh7): Bishop check on h7. Black can block with the king (Kb7), but not very forcing.\n\n#### **Captures**\n- c2h7 (Bxh7): Bishop captures pawn with check.\n- g7e5 (Qxe5+): Queen captures pawn with check.\n\n#### **Threats**\n- f1f7: Rook to f7, attacking the knight and threatening to double on the 7th rank.\n- f1f6: Rook to f6, attacking the queen.\n\n### 5. **Deep Calculation of Forcing Moves**\n\n#### **Move 1: g7e5 (Qxe5+)**\n- If Qxe5+, Black has to respond:\n  - Kb7: Only move.\n  - Now, White can play Nc5+ (with the knight from b3), forking king and queen.\n\nLet's check this line:\n1. Qxe5+ Kb7\n2. Nc5+ Kc8 (if Kb8, then Na6+ wins the queen)\n3. Bf5+ (Bishop joins the attack)\n\nBut let's check if Nc5+ is possible after Qxe5+ Kb7.\n\n#### **Move 2: b3c5 (Nc5+)**\n- If Nc5+ directly:\n  - Kb7: Only move.\n  - Qe4+ (Queen check), but Black can block with c6.\n\n#### **Move 3: f1f7**\n- Rook to f7, attacking the knight and threatening to double on the 7th rank.\n\n#### **Move 4: f1f6**\n- Rook to f6, attacking the queen.\n\n### 6. **Best Move Calculation**\n\n**Qxe5+** is a check and captures a pawn. Let's see the sequence:\n\n1. Qxe5+ Kb7\n2. Nc5+ Kc8 (if Kb8, then Na6+ wins the queen)\n3. Bf5+ (Bishop joins the attack)\n\nBut after 2... Kc8, what next? Let's see:\n\n- 3. Bf5+ Nd7 (blocking with the knight)\n- 4. Nxd7 Rxd7\n\nWhite is up material and has a strong attack.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Qxe5+ Kb7 2. Nc5+ Kc8 3. Bf5+ Rd7 4. Nxd7 Nxd7\n\nWhite is still up a pawn and has a dominating position.\n\n### 7. **Conclusion**\n\n**Qxe5+** is the most forcing move, wins a pawn, and keeps the initiative. It also threatens Nc5+ forking the king and queen.\n\n### 8. **Final Move**\n\n```\ng7e5\n```"
