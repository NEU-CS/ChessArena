Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n2r2k1r/5p1p/p1nn4/6B1/3P4/P1N5/1P3PPP/4RK2 b - - 0 25\n\n**Black to move.**\n\n### 1. Material and Position Overview\n\n- **Material:** Even.\n- **King Safety:** Black's king is on f8, White's king is on e1. Both are relatively safe, but Black's king is a bit exposed due to the open f-file and lack of pawn cover.\n- **Piece Activity:** \n  - Black's rooks are on c8 and h8, not very active.\n  - Black's knights are on d6 and c6, centralized and strong.\n  - White's bishop on g5 is active, eyeing the knight on d6 and possibly threatening ideas like Bh6.\n  - White's knight on c3 is also centralized.\n  - White's pawn structure is solid.\n\n### 2. Candidate Moves\n\nLet's go through the legal moves and see which ones make sense:\n\n#### King Moves\n- **f8g8, f8g7:** Moving the king doesn't seem necessary right now.\n\n#### Rook Moves\n- **h8g8:** Rook to g8 could prepare to contest the g-file, but White has no immediate threats there.\n- **c8e8, c8d8, c8b8, c8a8, c8c7:** Rook moves along the 8th rank or to c7. c7 could defend the 7th rank, but there's no immediate threat.\n  \n#### Knight Moves\n- **d6e8, d6b7, d6f5, d6b5, d6e4, d6c4:** \n  - d6f5: Attacks the bishop on g5, but White can simply move it.\n  - d6e4: Centralizes the knight, attacks the bishop on g5 and the pawn on c3, but White can play Nxe4.\n  - d6c4: Attacks the pawn on b2, but White can defend.\n- **c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, c6a7, c6e5, c6a5, c6d4, c6b4:** \n  - c6e5: Attacks the bishop on g5, but White can move it.\n  - c6d4: Attacks the pawn on b2 and the bishop on g5, but White can defend.\n\n#### Pawn Moves\n- **h7h6:** Attacks the bishop on g5, forcing it to decide.\n- **f7f6:** Attacks the bishop on g5, but weakens the king.\n- **a6a5:** Expands on the queenside.\n- **h7h5:** Expands on the kingside.\n- **f7f5:** Expands in the center, but weakens e5.\n\n### 3. Tactical Considerations\n\n- **h7h6**: Forces the bishop to decide. If Bxh6, then Nxc4 wins a pawn (since the bishop is no longer on g5 defending d4). If Bh4, then Black can consider Nf5 or Ne4.\n- **f7f6**: Weakens the king, not ideal.\n- **d6e4**: Attacks the bishop and centralizes the knight, but White can play Nxe4.\n- **c6d4**: Attacks the bishop and the pawn on b2, but White can play Be3.\n\n### 4. Best Move\n\n**h7h6** stands out as the most logical move:\n- It immediately questions the bishop on g5.\n- If White plays Bxh6, then after Nxc4, Black wins a pawn.\n- If White retreats the bishop, Black can continue with Nf5 or Ne4, gaining activity.\n\n### 5. Final Move\n\n```\nh7h6\n```"
