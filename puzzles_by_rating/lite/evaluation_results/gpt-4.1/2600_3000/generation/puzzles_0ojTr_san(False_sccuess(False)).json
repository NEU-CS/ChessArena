When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Moving the king doesn't immediately change the pawn structure or create threats.\n   - e6f7 and e6f6 move the king away from the queenside, where White's pawns are more dangerous.\n   - e6e7 and e6d7 keep the king near the queenside, possibly to help stop White's pawns.\n\n2. **Pawn moves:**\n   - **b7b6:** This move is risky. White can respond with c6, and after bxc5+, Kxc5, White's king is very active and can support the pawn advance.\n   - **a7a6:** This move doesn't change much, but it could prepare b6 in the future.\n   - **a7a5:** This move could try to fix White's pawns, but White can ignore it and play c6.\n   - **h6h5:** This move doesn't help much; White's kingside pawns are not a threat yet.\n\n**Best move:**\n\n- The main threat is White's queenside majority. Black's king needs to stay as close as possible to the queenside to try to stop the pawns.\n- Moving the king to d7 (e6d7) keeps it near the queenside and centralizes it further, ready to meet c6 with Kc7 or bxc6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The best move is **e6d7**. This keeps the king as close as possible to the queenside, maximizing Black's chances to hold the position.\n\n```\ne6d7\n```"
