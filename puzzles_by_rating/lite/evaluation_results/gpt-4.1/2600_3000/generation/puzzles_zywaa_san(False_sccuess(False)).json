When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King moves\n- **d2e3:** Centralizes the king, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.\n- **d2c3:** Moves toward the queenside, possibly to attack the c4 pawn.\n- **d2e2:** Slightly less active than d2e3.\n- **Other king moves:** Less active.\n\n### 2. Pawn moves\n- **g3g4:** Attacks Black's g5 pawn, but Black can respond with h6-h5 or g5-g4.\n- **h2h3:** Prepares to support g4, but slow.\n- **f2f3:** Supports e4, but weakens the king's position.\n- **h2h4:** Prepares to play h4-h5, but doesn't immediately threaten.\n- **f2f4:** Aggressive, but may weaken e3 square.\n\n### Strategic considerations:\n- White's king is well placed to attack Black's queenside pawns.\n- Black's king is far from the action.\n- The move **d2c3** attacks the c4 pawn, which is isolated and cannot be defended by Black's king. If White can win this pawn, it will create a passed pawn on the queenside.\n\n### Calculation:\n- **d2c3** threatens to take c4.\n- If Black plays ...h6, White can play Kxc4, then advance the king further.\n- If Black tries to push c3, White can play Kxc4, and Black has no way to support the c-pawn.\n\n### Alternative: g3g4\n- If g3g4, Black can play h6, and the position remains locked.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**d2c3** is the best move, as it immediately threatens to win a pawn and create a passed pawn, while also centralizing the king for the endgame.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nd2c3\n```"
