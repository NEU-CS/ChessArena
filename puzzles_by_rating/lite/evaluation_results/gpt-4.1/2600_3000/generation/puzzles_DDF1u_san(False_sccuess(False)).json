When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's break down the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n2rr4/Rb1N3p/8/6pk/3Qp3/1q2P1P1/7P/3R2K1 b - - 4 34\n\n**Black to move.**\n\n**Material count:**\n- Black: Rooks on d8, c8; Bishop on b7; Queen on b3; Pawns on e4, h5, h7\n- White: Rook on a7, d1; Queen on d4; Knight on d7; Pawns on e3, g3, h2; King on g1\n\n**King safety:**\n- Black's king is not visible (must be off the back rank, possibly h5 is the king, but that's a pawn).\n- White's king is on g1, relatively safe for now.\n\n**Threats:**\n- White threatens Qg7# (mate) if the g-file is opened or if the h5 pawn moves.\n- Black's queen on b3 is very active, but the rest of Black's pieces are somewhat passive.\n- White's knight on d7 is very strong, controlling key squares.\n\n**Immediate Tactics:**\n- Black is under heavy pressure. White's queen and knight coordinate well, and the rook on a7 is eyeing b7.\n- Black's queen on b3 is attacking d1 and b2, but White's back rank is covered.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\nLet's look at the most forcing moves first:\n- **d8h8**: Rook to h8, possibly defending h7, but doesn't seem to help.\n- **b3d1**: Queen takes rook on d1. Let's check this line:\n    - 1... Qd1+ 2. Qxd1+ Rxd1+ 3. Kf2 (or Kg2) and Black is down material, but at least exchanges queens.\n- **b3d5**: Queen to d5, attacking the queen, but White can exchange.\n- **b3e3+**: Queen to e3+, check. Let's see:\n    - 1... Qe3+ 2. Qxe3 Rxd7 3. Rxd7 and Black is down a rook.\n- **b3b2**: Queen to b2, attacking the rook, but White can ignore.\n- **h5h6**: Pawn to h6, but White can play Qg7#.\n- **g5g4**: Pawn to g4, but doesn't seem to help.\n\n**Critical lines:**\nLet's check **b3d1** in detail:\n1. ... Qd1+ 2. Qxd1 Rxd1+ 3. Kf2 (or Kg2)\n- Black has lost the queen for a rook, and White is up a full rook and knight, with a winning position.\n\nIs there any way to create counterplay or avoid immediate mate threats?\n\n**Defensive moves:**\n- **d8g8**: Rook to g8, defending g7. But White can play Nf6+, and after Bxf6, Qxf6, and mate is coming.\n- **d8f8**: Rook to f8, but doesn't help.\n- **c8c2**: Rook to c2, attacking h2, but White can ignore and play Nf6+.\n- **b3g8**: Queen to g8, but that's not legal.\n\n**Is there any way to create a perpetual or force a draw?**\n- If Black plays **b3d1+** and exchanges queens, at least the immediate mate threat is gone, and Black can try to hold the endgame, though White is winning.\n\n**Best practical chance:**\n- **b3d1** is the only move that removes White's queen and avoids immediate mate. All other moves allow White to continue the attack or deliver mate.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb3d1\n```"
