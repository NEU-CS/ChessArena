When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \nr4r1k/p5b1/3BP3/1p1Q3p/4P2q/8/PP1N3P/R4bK1 w - - 1 26\n\n**White to move.**\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: Queen (d5), Rook (a1), Bishop (e6), Knight (d2), Pawns (a2, b2, e4, h2)\n- Black: Queen (h4), Rook (f8), Rook (a8), Bishop (g7), Bishop (f1), Pawns (a7, b5, h5)\n\n**King safety:**\n- White king on g1, somewhat exposed but not under immediate threat.\n- Black king on h8, also exposed, especially with White's queen and bishop active.\n\n**Tactical threats:**\n- Black threatens ...Qf2+ or ...Qh2+ ideas, but White's queen and bishop are very active.\n- White has a strong bishop on e6, queen on d5, and can consider checks or attacks on the Black king.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\nLet's look for forcing moves (checks, captures, threats):\n\n1. **d5g5** (Queen to g5, check)\n   - This is a check. Black must respond.\n   - If ...Bh6, then Qxh6+ Bxh6, Bxh6 and White is winning.\n   - If ...Qxg5+, then Bxg5 and White is up material.\n\n2. **d5h5** (Queen to h5, check)\n   - This is a check. Black can respond with Bh6 or Kg8.\n   - If ...Bh6, then Qxh6+ Bxh6, Bxh6 and White is winning.\n   - If ...Kg8, then Qxh4.\n\n3. **d6f8** (Bishop to f8, check)\n   - This is a check. Black can respond with Rxf8, and then White can play Qxh5+.\n   - But after Rxf8, White's attack is not as strong as with the queen.\n\n4. **e6e7** (Bishop to e7, attacking the rook)\n   - Not a check, but attacks the rook on f8.\n\n5. **d6e5** (Bishop to e5, attacking the queen)\n   - Not a check, but attacks the queen.\n\n**Let's analyze the most forcing move: d5g5 (Qxg5+).**\n\n### 1. d5g5 (Qxg5+)\n- Black has to respond to the check.\n- Possible responses:\n  - ...Bh6 (blocking with bishop)\n    - Qxh6+ Bxh6, Bxh6 and White is up a piece and attacking.\n  - ...Qxg5 (capture)\n    - Bxg5, White is up a piece.\n  - ...Kg8 (move king)\n    - Qxh4, White wins the queen.\n\n### 2. d5h5 (Qh5+)\n- Black can play Bh6, Qxh5 Bxh6, Bxh6 and White is up a piece.\n- Or ...Kg8, Qxh4.\n\n### 3. d6f8 (Bf8+)\n- Rxf8, Qxh5+ Bh6, Qxh6+ Kg8, Qxh4. White is up material, but the attack is less direct.\n\n### 4. d6e5 (Be5, attacking queen)\n- Not as forcing as the checks.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**d5g5** (Qxg5+) is the most forcing and wins material or leads to a decisive attack. Let's check for any tactical resources for Black after this move:\n\n- If ...Qxg5+, Bxg5, White is up a piece.\n- If ...Bh6, Qxh6+ Bxh6, Bxh6, White is up a piece.\n- If ...Kg8, Qxh4, White wins the queen.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\nd5g5\n```"
