When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Qg5+  \n  If 41. Bg3 (blocking), then ...Ra2+ 42. Bf2 Rxf2+ 43. Kxf2 Qh4+ 44. Kg2 Qg3+ and Black gets perpetual or more.\n- If 41. Kh2, then ...Ra2 threatens mate on g2.\n- If 41. Kf1, then ...Ra1+ 42. Be1 Qg2# is mate.\n\n**Calculation for a1a2:**\n- 40... Ra2  \n  Attacks the bishop, but White can play Qe1 or Qe5, defending.\n\n**Calculation for e7c5:**\n- 40... Qc5  \n  Attacks c5 pawn, but White can play Qe5 or Qe1, defending.\n\n**Best move:**\nThe move **e7g5** (Qg5+) creates immediate threats to the White king, forces White to respond, and could lead to a perpetual or even a mating net if White is careless.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne7g5\n```"
