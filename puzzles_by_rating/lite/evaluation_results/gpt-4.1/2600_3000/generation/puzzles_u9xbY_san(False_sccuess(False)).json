When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n5B2/8/4p1p1/3nPp1p/p1k3rP/P5P1/5P1K/3R4 b - - 9 54\n\n**Black to move. Legal moves:**  \nd5e7, d5c7, d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3, g4g5, g4h4, g4f4, g4e4, g4d4, g4g3, c4b5, c4c3, c4b3, g6g5, f5f4\n\n**Material count:**\n- Black: King (c4), Knight (d5), Rook (g4), Pawns (a4, e6, f5, g6, h5)\n- White: King (h2), Rook (d1), Bishop (f8), Pawns (a3, f2, g3, h4, e5)\n\n**Position assessment:**\n- Black is up material (rook and knight vs rook and bishop, but Black has more pawns and active pieces).\n- White's king is far from the action and somewhat boxed in.\n- Black's rook is very active on g4, threatening along the 4th rank and possibly g-file.\n- White's bishop on f8 is not very active but can become dangerous if it gets into play.\n- Black's knight on d5 is central and controls many squares.\n- Black's pawns are advanced and can become dangerous, especially the a4 pawn.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\nLet's consider the most forcing and dangerous moves first.\n\n### 1. Rook moves (g4g5, g4h4, g4f4, g4e4, g4d4, g4g3)\n- **g4g5:** Defends the e5 pawn, but doesn't create a direct threat.\n- **g4h4:** Threatens to invade on h2, possibly with mate threats, but White can defend with Kg2.\n- **g4f4:** Attacks the f2 pawn, but White can defend with Kg2.\n- **g4e4:** Attacks the e5 pawn, but White can defend with Bd6.\n- **g4d4:** Attacks the d1 rook, but White can move the rook.\n- **g4g3:** Attacks the f2 pawn, but White can play fxg3.\n\n### 2. Knight moves (d5e7, d5c7, d5f6, d5b6, d5f4, d5b4, d5e3, d5c3)\n- **d5f4:** Forks the king and bishop, but the king is not on a square to be forked.\n- **d5e3:** Attacks the rook on d1, but the rook can move.\n- **d5c3:** Attacks the rook on d1 and the pawn on a3, but the rook can move.\n- **d5e7, d5c7, d5f6, d5b6, d5b4:** These don't create immediate threats.\n\n### 3. Pawn moves (c4b5, c4c3, c4b3, g6g5, f5f4)\n- **c4b5:** Advances the pawn, but doesn't create a threat.\n- **c4c3:** Advances the pawn, but White can play Rc1.\n- **g6g5:** Supports h5 pawn, but doesn't create a threat.\n- **f5f4:** Attacks the bishop on f8, forcing it to move.\n\n### 4. Immediate threats\n- **g4h4:** If White plays Kg2, Black can try to double up on the h-file, but White's king can escape.\n- **f5f4:** Attacks the bishop, forcing it to move. If Bxe7, then Nxe7 and Black is up a piece.\n- **g4g5:** Defends the e5 pawn, but not very forcing.\n\n### 5. Tactical ideas\n- **f5f4** is very strong because it attacks the bishop on f8. If the bishop moves, Black can continue to push pawns or bring the knight into play.\n- If White plays Bxe7, then Nxe7 and Black is up a piece.\n- If the bishop retreats, Black can continue to press with pawn advances or rook maneuvers.\n\n### 6. Checking for tactics\n- Is there a mate threat? Not immediately.\n- Is there a way to win material? **f5f4** attacks the bishop, and if White captures on e7, Black wins a piece.\n\n### 7. Best move\n**f5f4** is the most forcing move, attacking the bishop and threatening to win material.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf5f4\n```"
