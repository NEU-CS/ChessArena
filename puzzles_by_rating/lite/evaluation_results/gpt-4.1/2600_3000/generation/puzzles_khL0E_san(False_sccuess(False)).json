When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If bishop moves, White can play a4-a5 and push the pawn.\n- **a4a5**: Immediate pawn push, but Black can play b3 and try to create a passed pawn.\n- **b5b6**: Rook b6 attacks c7 pawn, but Black can play Kc5 or Kd7.\n- **f5e6**: King attacks bishop, but bishop can move.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n- **b5e5**: If ...Bd6, then a4-a5, and White's a-pawn is very strong. If ...Bd8, White can play a5-a6, and the rook can support the pawn.\n- **a4a5**: If ...b3, then a6, but Black can play b2 and try to promote.\n- **b5b6**: If ...Kc5, then a4-a5, but the king is closer to the pawn.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **b5e5** is the most active, attacking the bishop and preparing to support the a-pawn's advance. It also keeps the rook active and on the fifth rank, where it can swing to the kingside if needed.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb5e5\n```"
