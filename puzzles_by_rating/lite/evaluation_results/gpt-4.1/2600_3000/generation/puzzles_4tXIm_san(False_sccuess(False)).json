When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

It attacks the White king and tries to open lines.\n   - If White takes with the king (Kxe4), Black can play Kg4, activating the king.\n   - If White ignores, Black can play e3, creating a passed pawn.\n   - This move tries to create counterplay and distract White from the kingside.\n\n7. **c7c5 (Pawn to c5):**\n   - Supports d4, but White can ignore and keep pushing kingside pawns.\n\n8. **b7b5 (Pawn to b5):**\n   - Similar to b6, not urgent.\n\n**Deep analysis of e5e4:**\n- If 1...e4+ 2.Kxe4 Kg4, Black's king becomes active, threatening Kg3 and possibly taking on g5.\n- If White ignores and plays, say, 2.Kf4, then 2...e3 wins material or creates a passed pawn.\n- If White plays 2.Kg2, then 2...e3 is strong.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **e5e4** is the most dynamic move, creating immediate threats and counterplay, and is the best chance for Black to hold or even win.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne5e4\n```"
