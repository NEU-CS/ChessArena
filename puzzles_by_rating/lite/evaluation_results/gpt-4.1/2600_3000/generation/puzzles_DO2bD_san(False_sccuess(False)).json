When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This is a critical candidate.\n11. **e7d6** (Queen to d6): Not relevant.\n12. **a7b8** (King move): Not relevant.\n13. **a7a8** (King move): Not relevant.\n14. **a7b7** (King move): Not relevant.\n15. **a7b6** (King move): Not relevant.\n16. **b4b8** (Rook to b8): Not relevant.\n17. **b4b7** (Rook to b7): Not relevant.\n18. **b4b6** (Rook to b6): Not relevant.\n19. **b4b5** (Rook to b5): Not relevant.\n20. **b4g4** (Rook to g4): Attacks bishop and pawn, but White can play d6.\n21. **b4f4** (Rook to f4): Attacks bishop, but White can play d6.\n22. **b4e4** (Rook to e4): Attacks bishop, but White can play d6.\n23. **b4d4** (Rook to d4): Attacks queen, but White can play d6.\n24. **b4c4** (Rook to c4): Attacks king, but White can play d6.\n25. **b4a4** (Rook to a4): Not relevant.\n26. **b4b3** (Rook to b3): Not relevant.\n27. **b4b2** (Rook to b2): Not relevant.\n28. **b4b1** (Rook to b1): Not relevant.\n29. **a6a5** (Pawn move): Not relevant.\n30. **e5e4** (Pawn move): Not relevant.\n\n**Critical Move:**\n- **e7e6** (Queen takes e6): This move removes White's most dangerous threat, the e6 pawn, which is about to promote. If Black does not take this pawn, White will play d6 and then e7-e8=Q, and Black will be in trouble.\n\n**Tactical Check:**\n- After **e7e6**, what can White do? White can try to play d6, but now the e6 pawn is gone, so the threat is much less.\n- If Black does not play **e7e6**, White will play d6 and then e7-e8=Q, which is decisive.\n\n**Other Moves:**\n- Moves like **b4d4** (rook attacks queen) are interesting, but White can simply play d6, and the threat remains.\n- Defensive queen moves (like e7e8, e7d8) are too passive and do not solve the problem.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is **e7e6**, capturing the dangerous passed pawn and removing White's most immediate threat.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne7e6\n```"
