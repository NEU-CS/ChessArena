When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black king can go to g6 or f5.\n2. **a5a8+**: Queen check. Black king can go to g5 or f5.\n3. **a5c7+**: Queen check. Black king can go to g6 or f5.\n4. **c4g8+**: Bishop check. Black king can only go to g6.\n5. **c4f7+**: Bishop check. Black king can go to g5 or f5.\n6. **c4e6+**: Bishop check. Black king can go to g5 or f5.\n\nLet's analyze the most forcing moves: **checks**.\n\n### 1. a5d8+ (Queen to d8 check)\n- Black king can go to g6 or f5.\n- If ...Kg6, White can try Qg8+ (but then ...Kf6).\n- If ...Kf5, White can try Qd5+.\n\n### 2. c4g8+ (Bishop to g8 check)\n- Black king must go to g6 (f5 is covered by the queen).\n- After ...Kg6, White can try Qg5+ (but then ...Kxg5).\n- Or Qe8+ (but then ...Kf6).\n\n### 3. a5e1 (Queen to e1, not a check, but covers the first rank and threatens mate ideas, but not forcing).\n\n### 4. a5d5+ (Queen to d5 check)\n- Black king can go to g6 or f5.\n- If ...Kg6, White can try Qg8+.\n- If ...Kf5, White can try Qf7+.\n\n### 5. a5f5+ (Queen to f5 check)\n- Black king can only go to g7.\n- After ...Kg7, White can try Qg5+ (but then ...Kf8).\n\n### 6. c4d5+ (Bishop to d5 check)\n- Black king can go to g6 or f5.\n- If ...Kg6, White can try Qg8+.\n- If ...Kf5, White can try Qf7+.\n\n### 7. a5h5+ (Queen to h5 check)\n- Black king can go to g7 or e7.\n- If ...Kg7, White can try Qg5+.\n- If ...Ke7, White can try Qe5+.\n\n### 8. a5g5+ (Queen to g5 check)\n- Black king can go to f7 or e6.\n- If ...Kf7, White can try Qg8+.\n- If ...Ke6, White can try Qe5+.\n\n### 9. a5e5+ (Queen to e5 check)\n- Black king can go to g6 or f7.\n- If ...Kg6, White can try Qg8+.\n- If ...Kf7, White can try Qg8+.\n\n### 10. a5c7+ (Queen to c7 check)\n- Black king can go to g6 or f5.\n\n### 11. c4e6+ (Bishop to e6 check)\n- Black king can go to g5 or f5.\n\n### 12. c4f7+ (Bishop to f7 check)\n- Black king can go to g5 or f5.\n\n### 13. c4g8+ (Bishop to g8 check)\n- Black king can only go to g6.\n\n### Let's try to find a forced mate or a way to win material.\n\n#### Let's check a5d8+:\n\n1. Qd8+ Kg6 (if Kf5, Qd5+ is a check again)\n2. Qg8+ Kf6 (if Kh6, Qh8#)\n3. Qg5+ Kxg5 (if Kf5, Qg4#)\n4. h4#\n\nWait, let's check if that's possible:\n\n1. Qd8+ Kg6\n2. Qg8+ Kf6\n3. Qg5+ Kxg5\n4. h4#\n\nBut after 3...Kxg5, h4+ is not mate because the king can go to f5.\n\nAlternatively, let's try a5d8+ Kf5:\n\n1. Qd8+ Kf5\n2. Qd5+ Kf6 (if Kg6, Qg8+)\n3. Qg5+ Kxg5\n4. h4#\n\nAgain, after Kxg5, h4+ is not mate.\n\n#### Let's try c4g8+:\n\n1. Bg8 Kg6 (only move)\n2. Qg5+ Kxg5 (if Kf5, Qg4#)\n3. h4#\n\nBut again, after Kxg5, h4+ is not mate.\n\n#### Let's try a5f5+:\n\n1. Qf5+ Kg7 (only move)\n2. Qg5+ Kf8 (only move)\n3. Qg8+ Ke7 (only move)\n4. Qe6+ Kd8 (only move)\n5. Qe8#\n\nLet's check this line:\n\n1. Qf5+ Kg7\n2. Qg5+ Kf8\n3. Qg8+ Ke7\n4. Qe6+ Kd8\n5. Qe8#\n\nThis is a forced mate in 5!\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\na5f5\n```"
