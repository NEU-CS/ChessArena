When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Checks\n- **d5e7** (Bishop check): This forces the Black king to move to h8 or f8, or block with the queen on f8. Let's see what happens:\n    - If ...Kg7, then White can continue with Qe5+ or Qc3+.\n    - If ...Kf8, then White can consider Qe5 or Qc3.\n    - If ...Qf8, White can trade queens and remain with two bishops and a rook vs rook and queen, but White's bishops are strong.\n\n- **c5e7** (Bishop check): Same as above, but from a different bishop.\n\n### 2. Captures\n- **d5c3** (Bishop takes c3): Captures the queen, but Black will recapture with the pawn (bxc3), and White loses a bishop for a queen, which is a good trade.\n- **c5f2** (Bishop takes f2): Captures a pawn, but not as forcing as capturing the queen.\n\n### 3. Other Moves\n- **e5e6**: Pawn push, attacks f7, but not as forcing as the above.\n- **g2g3**: Defensive, but not urgent.\n\n### Let's Calculate the Most Forcing Line\n\n#### Option 1: d5c3 (Bxc3)\n- White plays Bxc3, capturing the queen.\n- Black plays bxc3 (recaptures).\n- White is up a queen for a bishop, a decisive material advantage.\n\n#### Option 2: d5e7+ (Bishop check)\n- Black must respond:\n    - ...Kg7: White can then play Qe5+ or Qc3+.\n    - ...Kf8: White can play Qe5 or Qc3.\n    - ...Qf8: White can trade queens and remain with two bishops and a rook vs rook and queen.\n\nBut **d5c3** is a direct queen capture, winning material immediately.\n\n### Double-Check for Tactics\nIs there any danger after Bxc3? Let's see:\n- After Bxc3 bxc3, Black's rook on b2 is active, but White's queen and bishops are well placed.\n- No immediate back-rank mate threats, as White can always play h3-h4 or g2-g3 to give the king an escape square.\n\n### Conclusion\n**The best move is to capture the queen with the bishop:**\n```\nd5c3\n```"
