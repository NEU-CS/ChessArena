When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n2r2r1k/2Nb2pp/pB1p4/1p5q/4Pb2/P2Q3P/BP4K1/3R1R2 w - - 1 36\n\n**White to move.**\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Pawns (a3, b2), King, h3 pawn\n- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 4 Pawns (a6, b5, d6, g7, h7), King\n\n**Key features:**\n- White has a powerful bishop on b6, and another on a2.\n- Black's king is on h8, with some pawn cover but also some weaknesses.\n- Black's queen is on h5, potentially threatening but also far from the center.\n- White's queen is on d3, well centralized.\n- White's rook on d1 is on an open file, and the other rook is on f1.\n\n**Tactical ideas:**\n- The bishop on b6 attacks the pawn on d6 and controls important diagonals.\n- The bishop on c7 attacks the rook on f8 and controls the a5-e1 diagonal.\n- The queen on d3 can swing to the kingside or attack the center.\n- The rook on d1 can invade via the d-file.\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- Is there a forced mate or a decisive material win?\n- Are there any tactical shots, such as discovered attacks or pins?\n\n**Candidate moves:**\nLet's look at the most forcing moves first:\n\n1. **c7e8**: Bishop takes rook on e8. This is a check, and Black must respond. Let's see what happens:\n   - 36. Bc7xe8 Rfxe8 (forced)\n   - Now, White can try Qxd6, but after ...Qe2+ White's king is exposed.\n   - Alternatively, after Bxe8, White is up an exchange but loses the powerful bishop.\n\n2. **d3d6**: Queen takes pawn on d6, attacking the rook on f8 and threatening Qxf8+.\n   - 36. Qxd6 Qf3+ (Black can check on f3)\n   - 37. Kg1 (forced), then ...Qe3+ or ...Qxh3, but White's king is relatively safe.\n   - After Qxd6, White threatens Qxf8+ and Qg3, so Black must react.\n\n3. **f1f4**: Rook to f4, attacking the queen on h5 and possibly swinging to g4 or h4.\n   - 36. Rf4 Qxh3+ (Black can grab the pawn)\n   - 37. Kxh3 Rxf4, but then White loses the exchange.\n\n4. **e4e5**: Pawn push, attacking the bishop on f4 and opening lines.\n   - 36. e5 dxe5, but this doesn't seem to lead to anything concrete.\n\n5. **a2g8**: Bishop to g8, threatening mate on h7, but Black can defend with Rxg8.\n\n6. **d3d5**: Queen to d5, attacking the bishop on f4 and threatening Qxh5.\n\n**Let's focus on the most forcing moves:**\n- **Qxd6**: Grabs a pawn, threatens Qxf8+, and keeps pressure.\n- **Bxe8**: Wins the exchange, but loses the powerful bishop.\n- **Rf4**: Attacks the queen, but Black can counterattack.\n\n**Let's calculate Qxd6:**\n1. Qxd6 Qf3+ (Black's only check)\n2. Kg1 (forced)\n3. ...Qe3+ (another check)\n4. Kh1 (forced)\n5. ...Qxh3+ (grabs pawn)\n6. Kg1 (back)\n7. ...Qe3+ (perpetual check?)\n\nBut White can block with Rf2 at some point.\n\nAlternatively, after Qxd6, if Black doesn't check, White threatens Qxf8+ and Qg3.\n\n**Now, let's check Bxe8:**\n1. Bxe8 Rfxe8\n2. Qxd6 (now White is up the exchange and a pawn)\n3. ...Qxe8 (Black can trade queens, but White is up material)\n\nBut after Bxe8, White loses the powerful bishop, and Black's queen can become active.\n\n**What about Rf4?**\n1. Rf4 Qxh3+ (Black grabs pawn)\n2. Kxh3 Rxf4 (Black wins the exchange)\n\nNot good for White.\n\n**What about a quiet move like h3h4?**\nNot forcing, and Black can attack.\n\n**What about d3d5?**\n1. Qd5 attacks the bishop on f4 and threatens Qxh5.\n2. If ...Qxd5, exd5, White has a passed pawn and attacks.\n\nBut Black can play ...Qe2+ and check.\n\n**Best move:**\nAfter careful analysis, **Qxd6** is the most forcing and keeps the initiative. It threatens Qxf8+ and keeps Black on the defensive. If Black tries perpetual checks, White can block with Rf2.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nd3d6\n```"
