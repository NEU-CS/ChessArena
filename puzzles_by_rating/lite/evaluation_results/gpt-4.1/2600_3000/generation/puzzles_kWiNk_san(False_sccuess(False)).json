When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material Count\n- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, Bishop, 7 Pawns\n- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 1 Bishop, 6 Pawns\n\nWhite is up a bishop for a pawn.\n\n### 2. King Safety\n- Black's king is on f8, not fully safe (open g-file, queenside rook not connected).\n- White's king is on g1, relatively safe.\n\n### 3. Piece Activity\n- White's bishop on c6 is very strong, eyeing the a8 rook and controlling key diagonals.\n- White's queen on b3 is active.\n- Black's pieces are somewhat passive, especially the a8 rook.\n\n### 4. Candidate Moves\nLet's look at the most forcing moves first, especially those involving checks, captures, and threats.\n\n#### a) **c6e8** (Bishop takes rook, check)\n- Bishop captures rook on e8 with check.\n- Black must respond to the check.\n- If ...Qxe8, White has won the exchange (rook for bishop).\n- If ...Rxe8, White can consider Qb4+ or Qf3.\n\n#### b) **c6a8** (Bishop takes rook)\n- Bishop captures rook on a8.\n- No check, but wins the exchange.\n\n#### c) **c6d7** (Bishop attacks queen)\n- Bishop attacks the queen, but not as forcing as the captures.\n\n#### d) **b3e6** (Queen check)\n- Queen gives check on e6.\n- Black can block with Nxe6 or Qxe6.\n\n#### e) **Other moves**\n- Most other moves are less forcing and do not create immediate threats.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Most Forcing Line\n\n#### **c6e8** (Bishop takes rook, check)\n- 1. Bxe8 Qxe8 (forced, as king cannot move to e7 or g8)\n- Now, White has won the exchange (rook for bishop), and Black's king remains exposed.\n- White can continue with Qb4+ or Qf3, keeping up the pressure.\n\n#### **c6a8** (Bishop takes rook, no check)\n- 1. Bxa8 Nxh3+ (Black can try to create counterplay with a knight sacrifice)\n- 2. Kg2 Nf4+ (forking king and queen)\n- This line is dangerous for White, as Black gets counterplay.\n\n#### **b3e6** (Queen check)\n- 1. Qe6 Nxe6 (forced)\n- 2. Bxa8 Nxh3+ (again, Black gets counterplay)\n- This is less clear than the first line.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\n**The best move is c6e8 (Bxe8+).**  \n- It wins the exchange with check, avoids Black's counterplay with Nxh3+, and keeps the initiative.\n\n### Final Move\n\n```\nc6e8\n```"
