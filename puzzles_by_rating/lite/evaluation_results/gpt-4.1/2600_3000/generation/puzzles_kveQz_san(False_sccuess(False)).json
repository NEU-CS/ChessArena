When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \n- f8g7 (Bishop to g7)\n- f8e7 (Bishop to e7)\n- f8h6 (Bishop to h6)\n- f8d6 (Bishop to d6)\n- f8c5 (Bishop to c5)\n- b3c2 (King to c2)\n- b3a2 (King to a2)\n- e4e5 (Pawn to e5)\n- h3h4 (Pawn to h4)\n- f3f4 (Pawn to f4)\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: King (b3), Bishop (f8), Pawns (e4, f3, f5, h3)\n- Black: King (b5), Bishop (b2), Pawns (a3, f6, g5)\n\n**Position assessment:**\n- White is up a bishop for a pawn.\n- Black's a3 pawn is dangerous but currently blockaded.\n- White's king is close to the queenside, able to help stop the a-pawn.\n- Black's king is also on the queenside, but White's bishop is very active.\n- White's pawns on the kingside are ready to advance.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **f8g7**: Bishop attacks the g5 pawn, threatening to win it.\n2. **f8e7**: Bishop centralizes, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.\n3. **f8h6**: Bishop attacks g5 pawn, but less flexible than g7.\n4. **f8d6**: Bishop attacks e5, but not as direct as g7.\n5. **f8c5**: Bishop attacks a3 pawn, but Black's king can defend.\n6. **b3c2 / b3a2**: King moves, but doesn't improve position.\n7. **e4e5**: Pawn advances, but could be captured by f6 pawn.\n8. **h3h4**: Pawn advances, but not urgent.\n9. **f3f4**: Pawn advances, supports e5, but could be captured.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n- **f8g7**: If 1. Bxg7, White wins a pawn and threatens to push kingside pawns. Black can't defend the g5 pawn. After 1... Kc5 2. Bxf6 Bxf6 3. Kxa3, White is up a bishop and should win.\n- **f8c5**: Attacks a3, but after Kxc5, Black's king is active and White's bishop is less active than on g7.\n- **e4e5**: fxe5, and White loses a pawn for no reason.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is **f8g7**, capturing the g7 pawn, winning material, and threatening to push kingside pawns. This move increases White's advantage and eliminates Black's counterplay.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf8g7\n```"
