If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n8/1p1r1kp1/1P1n1p1p/1pR4P/5B2/2P2K2/5P2/8 b - - 13 51\n\n**It's Black to move.**\n\n**Material count:**  \n- Black: King (f7), Rook (d7), Knight (d6), pawns (b7, b5, f6, g7, h6)\n- White: King (f3), Rook (c5), Bishop (f4), pawns (b6, c3, f2, h5)\n\n**Immediate threats:**  \n- White's b6 pawn is very advanced and could promote soon.\n- White's rook on c5 is active and can support pawn promotion.\n- Black's knight on d6 is central and can block or attack.\n- Black's rook on d7 is defending the 7th rank.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **f7g8** (King to g8): Retreats the king, but doesn't address the pawn threats.\n2. **f7f8** (King to f8): Similar, but less active.\n3. **f7e8** (King to e8): Retreats, but exposes the king to checks.\n4. **f7e7** (King to e7): Moves king closer to the center, but could be exposed.\n5. **f7e6** (King to e6): Moves king forward, but could be dangerous.\n6. **d7d8** (Rook to d8): Passive, but keeps rook on back rank.\n7. **d7e7** (Rook to e7): Centralizes rook, but not much impact.\n8. **d7c7** (Rook to c7): Attacks c3 pawn, but White can defend.\n9. **d6e8** (Knight to e8): Retreats knight, not ideal.\n10. **d6c8** (Knight to c8): Retreats knight, not ideal.\n11. **d6f5** (Knight to f5): Attacks h4 and g3, but White's bishop covers f5.\n12. **d6e4** (Knight to e4): Attacks c3 and f2, centralizes knight.\n13. **d6c4** (Knight to c4): Attacks b6 pawn, but White can defend.\n14. **g7g6** (Pawn to g6): Defends h5, but doesn't address main threats.\n15. **f6f5** (Pawn to f5): Attacks bishop, but bishop can move.\n16. **b5b4** (Pawn to b4): Attacks c3 pawn, but White can respond.\n17. **g7g5** (Pawn to g5): Attacks h4, but White can respond.\n\n**Critical analysis:**\n\n- **White's main threat is the b6 pawn.** If Black does nothing, White can play Rc7, supporting b7 and b8=Q.\n- **Black's knight on d6 is well-placed, controlling key squares.**\n- **Rook on d7 is defending the 7th rank, but could be more active.**\n\n**Best candidate moves:**\n- **d7c7**: Rook attacks c3 pawn and also eyes the b7 square, possibly preparing to defend against b7-b8=Q.\n- **d6e4**: Knight jumps to e4, attacking c3 and f2, and centralizing. If White plays Kxe4, Black loses the knight, but if not, Black threatens to win a pawn.\n- **b5b4**: Attacks c3, but White can play cxb4, and after axb4, White's a-pawn is gone, but White's rook is active.\n\n**Let's calculate d7c7:**\n- 51...d7c7\n- 52. Rxc7+ (if White takes)\n- 52...Nxc7\n- 53. bxc7 (White pushes pawn)\n- 53...Ke7 (Black king approaches)\n- 54. c8=Q (White queens)\n- 54...Bxc8 (if Black can take, but not possible since Black has no bishop)\n- So after 52. Rxc7+ Nxc7 53. bxc7, Black is in trouble.\n\n**What if White doesn't take?**\n- 51...d7c7\n- 52. bxc7 (White pushes pawn)\n- 52...Rc8 (Black attacks pawn)\n- 53. Rxb5 (White takes b7)\n- 53...Nxb5 (Black takes back)\n- 54. c4 (White pushes c-pawn)\n- Black is still under pressure, but at least the b-pawn is gone.\n\n**What about d6e4?**\n- 51...d6e4\n- 52. Kxe4 (if White takes, Black loses knight)\n- 52. Rc7+ (White can play Rc7, threatening b7)\n- 52...Rxc7\n- 53. bxc7 (White pushes pawn)\n- 53...Nc5 (Black attacks c7 pawn)\n- 54. c8=Q (White queens)\n- 54...Bxc8 (Black has no bishop)\n- Not ideal.\n\n**What about b5b4?**\n- 51...b5b4\n- 52. cxb4 (White takes)\n- 52...Nb7 (Black attacks b6 pawn)\n- 53. Bc7 (White defends b6)\n- Black is still under pressure.\n\n**What about f6f5?**\n- 51...f6f5\n- 52. Bxd6 (White takes pawn)\n- 52...Rxd6 (Black takes back)\n- 53. Rxb5 (White takes b7)\n- Black is losing pawns.\n\n**What about g7g5?**\n- 51...g7g5\n- 52. hxg6+ (White takes)\n- 52...Kxg6 (Black takes back)\n- 53. Bxd6 (White takes d6)\n- Black is losing material.\n\n**What about d7d8?**\n- 51...d7d8\n- 52. Rc7+ (White checks)\n- 52...Rxc7\n- 53. bxc7 (White pushes pawn)\n- 53...Rc8 (Black attacks pawn)\n- 54. Bxd6 (White takes knight)\n- 54...Ke6 (Black king moves)\n- White is still better.\n\n**What about d7e7?**\n- 51...d7e7\n- 52. Bxd6 (White takes knight)\n- 52...Re6 (Black attacks bishop)\n- 53. Bc7 (White retreats)\n- Black is still under pressure.\n\n**What about d6c4?**\n- 51...d6c4\n- 52. Rxb5 (White takes b7)\n- 52...Nxb6 (Black takes b6)\n- 53. Rxb6 (White takes b6)\n- Black is losing.\n\n**What about d6f5?**\n- 51...d6f5\n- 52. Rxf5 (White takes knight)\n- 52...gxf5\n- 53. Bxh6 (White takes pawn)\n- Black is losing.\n\n**What about g7g6?**\n- 51...g7g6\n- 52. hxg6+ (White takes)\n- 52...Kxg6 (Black takes back)\n- 53. Bxd6 (White takes knight)\n- Black is losing.\n\n**What about king moves?**\n- f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7e7, f7e6: All king moves don't address the main threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **d7c7** is the best defensive try. It attacks the c3 pawn, and if White pushes b7, Black can play Rxb7, and if White takes on c7, Black can recapture with the knight and try to blockade the b-pawn. It also keeps the rook active.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nd7c7\n```"
