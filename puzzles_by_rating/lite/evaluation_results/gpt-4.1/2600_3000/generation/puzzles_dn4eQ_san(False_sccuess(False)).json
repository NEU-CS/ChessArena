When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Checks\n\n- **a6c8** (Qa6-c8+): Queen check on c8. Black can block with Re7 or move the king.\n- **a6a8** (Qa6-a8+): Queen check on a8. Black can block with Re7.\n- **a6b7** (Qa6-b7+): Queen check on b7. Black can block with Re7.\n- **a6e6** (Qa6-e6+): Queen check on e6. This is a forcing move, as it attacks the king and also attacks the rook on e8.\n\n### 2. Captures\n\n- **a6e6** (Qa6xe6+): This is both a check and a capture, taking the pawn on e6.\n\n### 3. Threats\n\n- **f4f5+**: Pawn push, attacking the king, but the king can move to f7 or g7.\n- **e3e4**: Pawn push, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n- **a2a4**: Pawn push, but not urgent.\n\n### 4. Defensive moves\n\n- None of the defensive moves seem urgent, as Black is not threatening mate or a decisive attack immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Let's Analyze the Most Forcing Move: **Qa6xe6+**\n\n**a6e6** (Qa6xe6+):\n\n- White plays Qa6xe6+, checking the Black king and capturing a pawn.\n- Black's king has to move. Let's look at the king's options:\n  - **Kg7**: The king can go to g7.\n  - **Kg6**: The king can go to g6.\n  - **Rxe6**: Black can block with the rook, but then White can trade queens for a rook, which is winning for White.\n\nIf Black plays **Kg7**:\n- White can continue with Qxe8, winning a rook.\n\nIf Black plays **Rxe6**:\n- White can play Rb6, attacking the rook and the pawn on d3.\n\n**Qa6xe6+** wins a pawn with check, and threatens to win more material.\n\n---\n\n## Let's Check Other Checks\n\n- **a6c8+**: After ...Re7, White has no follow-up.\n- **a6a8+**: After ...Re7, White has no follow-up.\n- **a6b7+**: After ...Re7, White has no follow-up.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Qa6xe6+** is the most forcing move, wins a pawn, checks the king, and threatens to win more material. It is the best move.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**\n```\na6e6\n```"
