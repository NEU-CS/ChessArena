When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let's check if the queen can go to c8. Yes, it's a legal move.\n\n### 3. c6a8 (Queen check)\n- Qa8+ K moves:\n  - If Kf6, Qf5# (supported by bishop)\n  - If Ke7, Qe6# (supported by bishop)\n  - If Kg6, Qf5# (supported by bishop)\n  - If Kf7, Qf5# (supported by bishop)\n\n### 4. c6c7 (Queen check)\n- Qc7+ is not as forcing, as Black can block with the rook or knight.\n\n### 5. c6h6 (Queen check)\n- Qh6+ is not as forcing, as Black can play gxh6.\n\n### 6. c6g6 (Queen check)\n- Qg6+ is not as forcing, as Black can play hxg6.\n\n### 7. c6f6 (Queen check)\n- Qf6+ is not as forcing, as Black can play Nxf6.\n\n### 8. c6e6 (Queen check)\n- Qe6+ is not as forcing, as Black can play Qxe6.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**The move c6c8 is a check, and if Black moves the king to any square, White can deliver mate with Qf5# or Qe6#.**\n\nLet's check for any possible interpositions or escapes:\n- After c6c8+, Black cannot block the check, as there are no pieces that can interpose on the c-file between c8 and f7.\n- The king must move, and all available squares are covered by the queen and bishop.\n\n**Therefore, c6c8 is a forced mate in one.**\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nc6c8\n```"
