When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Defensive moves\n\n#### f8f7\n- Defends g7, but blocks the rook's mobility and doesn't address the threat of Rxg7+ followed by Nxf6+.\n\n#### g8f7\n- Moves the king to f7, but then Qxf6+ is devastating.\n\n#### f8e8, f8d8, f8c8, f8b8\n- Rook moves along the 8th rank, not addressing the immediate threat.\n\n#### a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8\n- Rook moves, not relevant to the kingside defense.\n\n#### c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7f7, c7e7, c7d7, c7b6, c7a5\n- Queen moves. c7f7 is interesting, defending g7 and f6.\n\n#### f6d8, f6e7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4, f6d4, f6c3, f6b2, f6a1\n- Bishop moves. f6g5 attacks the knight on h5, but after Rxg5, White is still attacking.\n\n#### b7b6, a7a6, d6d5, c6c5, e4e3, b7b5, a7a5\n- Pawn moves. None of these address the immediate threat.\n\n### 2. Calculating the threat\n\nWhite threatens Rxg7+ followed by Nxf6+ or Qxf6+.\n\n#### Let's check f8f7:\n1. ... f8f7\n2. Rxg7+ Bxg7 (forced)\n3. Nxg7 (threatening Ne6+ and Qh7#)\n   - This looks dangerous for Black.\n\n#### Let's check c7f7:\n1. ... c7f7\n2. Nxf6+ Qxf6\n3. Qxf6 Rxf6\n   - White has won a piece.\n\n#### Let's check f6g5:\n1. ... f6g5\n2. Rxg5 (threatening Qg7#)\n   - If Qf7, then Rxg7+ Qxg7 Qxg7#\n\n#### Let's check f6e7:\n1. ... f6e7\n2. Rxg7+ Kh8 (forced)\n3. Qxh7#\n\n#### Let's check f6h4:\n1. ... f6h4\n2. Rxg7+ Qxg7\n3. Qxg7#\n\n#### Let's check e4e3:\n1. ... e4e3\n2. Rxg7+ Qxg7\n3. Nxg7\n\n#### Let's check c7f7:\n1. ... c7f7\n2. Nxf6+ Qxf6\n3. Qxf6 Rxf6\n   - White is up a piece.\n\n#### Let's check g8f7:\n1. ... g8f7\n2. Qxf6+ Kg8\n3. Rxg7+ Qxg7\n4. Qxg7#\n\n#### Let's check d6d5:\n1. ... d6d5\n2. Rxg7+ Qxg7\n3. Nxg7\n\n#### Let's check c6c5:\n1. ... c6c5\n2. Rxg7+ Qxg7\n3. Nxg7\n\n### 3. Is there any way to defend g7?\n\nThe only move that directly defends g7 is f8f7.\n\n#### Let's check f8f7 in detail:\n1. ... f8f7\n2. Rxg7+ Bxg7\n3. Nxg7 Rxg7\n4. Qxg7+ Qxg7\n5. Rxg7+ Kxg7\n\nMaterial after exchanges: Black has lost a rook and bishop for two rooks and a knight. Let's count:\n- White: Queen, rook, knight, 5 pawns\n- Black: Queen, rook, 6 pawns\n\nBut White is up the exchange and has a strong attack.\n\nAlternatively, after 1... f8f7, White could try:\n2. Nxf6+ Rxf6\n3. Qxf6 Qf7\n4. Rxg7+ Qxg7\n5. Rxg7+ Kh8\n\nBut then White is up a piece.\n\n### 4. Is there any counterplay?\n\nNone of the moves seem to offer counterplay. The only way to avoid immediate mate is to play f8f7.\n\n### 5. Final evaluation\n\n**Best move:**  \nThe only move that avoids immediate mate is **f8f7**. All other moves allow Rxg7+ and Qxg7# or similar.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\nf8f7\n```"
