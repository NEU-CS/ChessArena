When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n`rr5k/pRN1p3/3p2BB/3Pb1P1/8/5K1Q/P6P/3q4 w - - 7 35`\n\n**White to move. Legal moves:**  \n- f3e4 (King from f3 to e4)\n- f3e3 (King from f3 to e3)\n- f3g2 (King from f3 to g2)\n- f3f2 (King from f3 to f2)\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n### 1. Material and Threats\n- White is up a lot of material: two rooks, two bishops, and a queen versus Black's two rooks and a queen.\n- Black's queen is on d1, threatening the White king.\n- White's king is on f3, and the only legal moves are king moves, so White is in check.\n\n### 2. Black's Threats\n- The check is from the queen on d1.\n- Let's see which squares are safe for the king.\n\n#### a) f3e4 (King to e4)\n- e4 is not attacked by Black's queen or any other piece.\n- After Kxe4, White is safe for now.\n\n#### b) f3e3 (King to e3)\n- e3 is not attacked by Black's queen or any other piece.\n- After Ke3, White is safe for now.\n\n#### c) f3g2 (King to g2)\n- g2 is not attacked by Black's queen or any other piece.\n- After Kg2, White is safe for now.\n\n#### d) f3f2 (King to f2)\n- f2 is not attacked by Black's queen or any other piece.\n- After Kf2, White is safe for now.\n\n### 3. Which move is best?\nNow, let's consider which king move is best in terms of safety and future prospects.\n\n- **e4:** Moves the king toward the center, but exposes it to potential checks from Black's queen and rooks. However, White has a massive material advantage and can coordinate an attack.\n- **e3:** Keeps the king relatively central, but not as exposed as e4.\n- **g2:** Moves the king toward the queenside, away from the center, and closer to White's own pieces (queen on h3, bishop on g6).\n- **f2:** Keeps the king on the second rank, but doesn't improve its position.\n\n#### Let's check for immediate tactics:\n- After **Ke4**, Black has no immediate checks.\n- After **Ke3**, Black has no immediate checks.\n- After **Kg2**, Black has no immediate checks.\n- After **Kf2**, Black has no immediate checks.\n\n### 4. Which move helps White coordinate an attack?\n- **Ke4** brings the king closer to the center, but with so many pieces on the board, it's safer to keep the king away from the action.\n- **Kg2** tucks the king behind the bishop on g6 and the queen on h3, making it very safe and out of the way for White's heavy pieces to attack.\n\n### 5. Final Evaluation\n**Kg2** is the safest move, tucking the king away and allowing White to use the rest of the pieces to finish the game. The king is protected by the bishop on g6 and the queen on h3, and Black has no checks or threats.\n\n## Final Move\n\n```\nf3g2\n```"
