When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material Count\n- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, Knight, 6 Pawns\n- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, Knight, 6 Pawns\n\nMaterial is equal.\n\n### 2. King Safety\n- White's king is on g1, relatively safe for now.\n- Black's king is on h8, somewhat exposed, but not under immediate threat.\n\n### 3. Piece Activity\n- Black's pieces are very active, especially the queen on f5, bishop on h3, and knight on b4.\n- White's knight on c3 is under pressure, and the bishop on c1 is undeveloped.\n- The bishop on e2 is not developed yet.\n\n### 4. Threats\n- Black threatens ...Nc2, forking the queen and rook.\n- The bishop on h3 is menacing, and the queen on f5 is very active.\n- White's knight on c3 is attacked by the b4 knight and the d5 pawn.\n\n### 5. Candidate Moves\nLet's look at the legal moves and see which address the threats and/or create counterplay:\n\n#### a) Defending against ...Nc2\n- The move c3d5 attacks the queen and also covers the e3 square, but after Nxd5, Black is fine.\n- The move c3e2 retreats the knight, but it blocks the rook and bishop.\n- The move b1e4 develops a piece and attacks the queen, but the queen can move.\n\n#### b) Developing and Defending\n- The move c1h6 develops the bishop and attacks the bishop on h3, but Black can respond with Qxf3.\n- The move e1e2 brings the rook to the second rank, defending the knight and preparing to double rooks.\n\n#### c) Counterattack\n- The move f3g5 attacks the queen, but after Nxg5, Black wins a piece.\n\n#### d) Other moves\n- b2b3 attacks the knight on b4, but after Nxc3, bxc3, Black can play Qxf3.\n\n### 6. Calculating the Most Forcing Moves\n\n#### Let's examine **b1e4** (Qe4):\n\n- b1e4 attacks the queen on f5 and the knight on b4.\n- If Black plays dxe4, then Nxe4 attacks the bishop on h3 and covers c3.\n- If Black moves the queen, say Qh5, then Qxb4 wins a piece.\n\n#### Let's check the tactics:\n\n**1. b1e4 Qh5 (retreats)**\n   - Qxb4, White wins a piece.\n\n**2. b1e4 dxe4**\n   - Nxe4, White attacks the bishop on h3 and covers c3.\n\n**3. b1e4 Qf7**\n   - Qxb4, White wins a piece.\n\n**4. b1e4 Qg6**\n   - Qxg6 hxg6, White wins a piece.\n\nSo, **b1e4** is a strong move, attacking the queen and the knight, and if the queen moves, White wins the knight on b4.\n\n### 7. Final Evaluation\n\n**b1e4** is the best move, as it attacks the queen and the knight, and if the queen moves, White wins a piece. It also develops a piece and brings White closer to safety.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb1e4\n```"
