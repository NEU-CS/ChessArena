When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \ng4g5, g4h4, g4h3, g1h2, g1f2, b7b6, h5h4, b7b5\n\n**Material count:**  \n- Black: King (g4), Bishop (g1), pawns (b7, h5)\n- White: King (e4), Bishop (e1), pawns (f2, f5)\n\n**Position assessment:**\n- Black's king is active on g4.\n- Black's bishop is on g1, controlling the long diagonal.\n- Black has a passed pawn on b7.\n- White's king is centralized on e4.\n- White's bishop is on e1, not very active.\n- White has pawns on f2 and f5, with f5 being advanced.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **g4g5**: King moves up, but doesn't threaten anything immediately.\n2. **g4h4**: King moves to h4, attacking the h5 pawn.\n3. **g4h3**: King moves to h3, but doesn't threaten anything.\n4. **g1h2**: Bishop to h2, attacks f4 but not much else.\n5. **g1f2**: Bishop to f2, attacks e1 bishop and f5 pawn.\n6. **b7b6**: Pawn move, but doesn't threaten anything.\n7. **h5h4**: Pawn advances, but doesn't create a threat.\n8. **b7b5**: Pawn advances, but doesn't create a threat.\n\n**Deeper analysis of best candidate moves:**\n\n- **g1f2**: This move attacks both the bishop on e1 and the pawn on f5. If White exchanges bishops (Bxf2), Black recaptures with the king (Kxf2), and the king is active. If White does not exchange, Black threatens to capture on f5, which would win a pawn and create a passed pawn.\n\n- **g4h4**: This move attacks the h5 pawn, but White can defend with f4+ or move the bishop.\n\n- **g4g5**: This move keeps the king active, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n\n- **h5h4**: This move advances the pawn, but White can ignore it or play f4+.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **g1f2** is the strongest, as it attacks both the bishop and the pawn, and forces White to make a decision. If White exchanges bishops, Black's king becomes very active. If not, Black wins the f5 pawn.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng1f2\n```"
