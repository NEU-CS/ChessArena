If Black tries to defend with Re7, White can exchange rooks and go into a favorable endgame. If Black ignores, White can take on f5, winning a pawn and threatening to invade the 7th or 8th rank.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nh7f7\n```"

The bishop cannot stop the a-pawn alone, and the black king is cut off.\n- White can play a4-a5-a6, and the rook can help from the 7th rank.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**b4b5** is the best move, keeping the king active and supporting pawn promotion.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb4b5\n```"
