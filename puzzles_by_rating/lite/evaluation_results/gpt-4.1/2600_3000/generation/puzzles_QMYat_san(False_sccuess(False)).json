When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If Black plays b2, White can play Rxb2.\n- **d6d7**: Attacks the c7 pawn, threatening to win it.\n- **c8c7**: Doubles rooks on the 7th, attacking the c7 pawn.\n- **c8a8**: Attacks the a2 rook, but the rook can move away.\n\n**Let's calculate d6b6:**\n- d6b6 attacks the b3 pawn.\n- If Black plays b2, White can play Rxb2, winning the pawn.\n- If Black does nothing, White can capture on b3 next move.\n\n**Let's calculate d6d7:**\n- d6d7 attacks the c7 pawn.\n- If Black plays c5, White can play Rxd2, but that's not possible as there is no pawn on d2.\n- If Black does nothing, White can capture on c7 next move.\n\n**Let's calculate c8c7:**\n- c8c7 doubles rooks on the 7th, attacking the c7 pawn.\n- If Black plays b2, White can play Rxb2.\n\n**Which is stronger: d6b6 or d6d7 or c8c7?**\n- d6b6 attacks the more dangerous pawn (b3), which is closer to queening.\n- d6d7 and c8c7 attack the c7 pawn, but the b3 pawn is more dangerous.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\nd6b6\n```\nThis move attacks the b3 pawn, the most immediate threat, and keeps up the pressure."
