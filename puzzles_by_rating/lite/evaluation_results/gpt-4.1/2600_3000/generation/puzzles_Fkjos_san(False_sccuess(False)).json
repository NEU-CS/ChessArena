When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's break down the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:** 8/8/2B5/p3p1K1/8/4k3/8/8 w - - 0 54  \nWhite: King on g5, Bishop on c6  \nBlack: King on e3, pawn on e5, pawn on a5\n\nIt's White to move.\n\n### Step 1: Assess the Position\n\n- White is up a bishop for two pawns.\n- Black's king is somewhat centralized, but White's king is active.\n- Black's pawns are not immediately threatening to promote, but the e-pawn is closer.\n- White's bishop is well-placed and can control both pawns from a distance.\n\n### Step 2: Candidate Moves\n\nLet's look at the legal moves:\n\n**Bishop moves:**\n- c6e8, c6a8, c6d7, c6b7, c6d5, c6b5, c6e4, c6a4, c6f3, c6g2, c6h1\n\n**King moves:**\n- g5h6, g5g6, g5f6, g5h5, g5f5, g5h4, g5g4\n\n### Step 3: Plan\n\n- The main plan is to stop Black's pawns from advancing and use the king and bishop to win.\n- The e-pawn is the most dangerous, so we need to keep an eye on it.\n- The king is already active, so perhaps we can use it to attack the e-pawn or support the bishop.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Key Moves\n\n#### King Moves\n\n- **g5f5:** Moves closer to the e-pawn, threatening to attack it.\n- **g5f6:** Also approaches the e-pawn.\n- **g5g6:** Not very useful, as it doesn't help stop the pawns.\n- **g5h6, g5h5, g5h4:** Moving away from the center, not optimal.\n\n#### Bishop Moves\n\n- **c6e4:** Attacks the e5 pawn directly, but the king on e3 defends it.\n- **c6d5:** Controls the e4 square, but doesn't attack anything directly.\n- **c6f3:** Attacks the e4 square, but not the pawn.\n- **c6d7, c6b7, c6b5, c6a8, c6a4, c6h1, c6g2:** Not relevant to the immediate plan.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Forcing Lines\n\nIf we play **g5f5**:\n\n- Black cannot push e4 because the bishop controls e4.\n- If Black plays a4, we can play Bxa4.\n- If Black plays Kd4, we can play Bxe4.\n\nIf we play **c6e4**:\n\n- Black can play Kd4, attacking the bishop.\n- After Bf5, Kd5, the king is active, but we are not making progress.\n\n### Step 6: Best Move\n\n**g5f5** is the most active move, bringing the king closer to the e-pawn and supporting the bishop. It keeps maximum pressure on Black and threatens to win the e-pawn soon.\n\n### Step 7: Double-check for Tactics\n\n- After g5f5, Black cannot push e4.\n- If Black plays Kd4, we can play Bxe4.\n- If Black plays a4, we can play Bxa4.\n\n**No immediate tactics for Black.**\n\n### Final Move\n\n```\ng5f5\n```"
