When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \nr4rk1/1q3p1p/p3p1p1/1pb1P3/8/2N4Q/PPP3PP/4RR1K b - - 0 21\n\n**Black to move.**\n\n### 1. **Material Count**\n- Black: Rooks (a8, f8), Queen (b7), Bishop (c5), Pawns (a6, b5, e6, f7, g6, h7)\n- White: Rooks (e1, f1), Queen (h3), Knight (c3), Pawns (a2, b2, c2, e5, g2, h2), King (h1)\n\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a dangerous pawn on e5 and a centralized knight. Black's king is relatively safe, but White's queen is aggressively placed on h3.\n\n### 2. **Threats**\n- White threatens to invade on the kingside, especially with the queen on h3 and the possibility of doubling rooks on the f-file.\n- Black's queen on b7 eyes the g2 pawn and can swing to the kingside if needed.\n- The bishop on c5 is well-placed, controlling important diagonals.\n\n### 3. **Candidate Moves**\nLet's look at the most promising candidate moves:\n- **g8h8**: King sidestep, but doesn't address any threats.\n- **f8e8**: Centralizes the rook, but doesn't create threats.\n- **a8e8**: Doubles rooks on the e-file, possibly contesting White's control.\n- **b7b6**: Retreats the queen, but loses activity.\n- **c5d4**: Bishop attacks the knight and centralizes, but the knight is defended.\n- **b5b4**: Pushes the pawn, gaining space and possibly attacking the knight.\n- **g6g5**: Aggressive, but weakens the kingside.\n- **h7h5**: Similar, but less committal.\n\n### 4. **Tactical Considerations**\n- **b5b4** attacks the knight on c3. If the knight moves, the bishop on c5 could become more active.\n- **c5d4** attacks the knight, but White can defend with Qg3 or Ne2.\n- **a8e8** or **f8e8**: Doubling rooks on the e-file could be useful, but White's e5 pawn is well-defended.\n\n### 5. **Best Move?**\n- **b5b4** stands out: It attacks the knight on c3, forcing White to respond. If the knight moves, Black's bishop becomes more active, and the queenside pawns can become dangerous. It also doesn't weaken Black's king position.\n\n### 6. **Check for Tactics**\n- After **b5b4**, if White plays Ne4, then Be7 is possible, defending the kingside.\n- If White plays Na4, Black can play Be7 or Qb5.\n- There are no immediate tactics for White after b5b4.\n\n### 7. **Final Decision**\n**b5b4** is the best move, as it creates a threat, gains space, and doesn't weaken Black's position.\n\n---\n\n```\nb5b4\n```"
