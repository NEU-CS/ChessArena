When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n2k5/ppp5/8/2P2N1q/1P2P1b1/3n1p2/PB3Q1P/6NK w - - 4 33\n\n**White to move.**\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: Queen (f2), Knight (f5), Bishop (b2), Pawns (a2, b4, c5, e4, h2), King (g1)\n- Black: Queen (h5), Bishop (g4), Knight (d3), Pawns (a7, b7, c7, f3), King (c8)\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- Black threatens ...Nxf2, forking king and queen.\n- Black's queen is on h5, bishop on g4, knight on d3, and pawn on f3, all pressuring White's king.\n- White's king is on g1, relatively safe for now.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\nLet's look for checks, captures, and threats.\n\n### 1. Checks\n- f5e7: Nxe7+ (knight check)\n- f5g7: N(g7)+ (knight check)\n- f2h4: Qxh4 (queen check)\n- b2h8: Bxh8 (bishop check)\n- b2g7: Bg7 (bishop check)\n- b2f6: Bf6 (bishop check)\n- b2e5: Be5 (bishop check)\n- c5c6: c6+ (pawn check)\n\nLet's evaluate each check:\n\n#### a) **f5g7** (Nf5-g7+)\n- King on c8. Only move is Kd8.\n- After Kd8, what next? No immediate follow-up.\n\n#### b) **f5e7** (Nf5-e7+)\n- King on c8. Only move is Kd8.\n- After Kd8, knight is on e7, not threatening much.\n\n#### c) **b2h8** (Bxh8+)\n- King on c8. Only move is b7-b6 (blocking), but then White can continue with Qg3 or Qg7.\n- But after Bxh8+, Black can play Qxh8, so not a check.\n\n#### d) **b2g7** (Bg7+)\n- King on c8. Only move is Kd8.\n- After Kd8, not much follow-up.\n\n#### e) **b2f6** (Bf6+)\n- King on c8. Only move is Kd8.\n- After Kd8, not much follow-up.\n\n#### f) **b2e5** (Be5+)\n- King on c8. Only move is Kd8.\n- After Kd8, not much follow-up.\n\n#### g) **c5c6** (c6+)\n- Pawn to c6, check. Black can play bxc6 or Kd8.\n- If bxc6, White can play Ne7+ (forking king and queen).\n- Let's see: c5c6+ bxc6 Ne7+ Kd8 Nxc6+ Kc8 Nxh5, White wins a piece.\n\n### 2. Captures\n- f5g7 (Nf5xg7+)\n- f5e7 (Nf5xe7+)\n- f2h4 (Qxh4)\n- b2h8 (Bxh8)\n- b2g7 (Bxg7)\n- b2f6 (Bxf6)\n- b2e5 (Bxe5)\n- b2d4 (Bxd4)\n- f5d6 (Nxd6)\n- f5d4 (Nxd4)\n- f2g3 (Qxg3)\n- f2e3 (Qxe3)\n- f2d4 (Qxd4)\n\n### 3. Threats/Defensive moves\n- f2f3 (defends f3 pawn)\n- h2h3 (gives king luft)\n- g1h3 (moves king away from checks)\n\n### 4. Tactical ideas\n- c5c6+ is a forcing move. If bxc6, then Ne7+ forks king and queen.\n- Let's calculate: c5c6+ bxc6 Ne7+ Kd8 Nxc6+ Kc8 Nxh5, White wins a piece and is up material.\n\n### 5. Best move calculation\nLet's check if c5c6+ is safe:\n\n**Line 1:**\n1. c5c6+ bxc6\n2. Ne7+ Kd8\n3. Nxc6+ Kc8\n4. Nxh5\n\nWhite wins a piece (knight on d3), and Black's king is exposed.\n\n**Line 2:**\n1. c5c6+ Kd8 (if Black doesn't take)\n2. cxb7 (threatening b8=Q)\n3. If Qg5+ (Black tries to check), Kh1, and White is winning.\n\n**Line 3:**\n1. f5g7+ Kd8\n2. Nxh5 (taking the queen)\nBut after f5g7+ Kd8 Nxh5, Black can play Nxf2, forking king and queen.\n\n**Line 4:**\n1. f2h4 (Qxh4)\nBut then Black can play Nxf2+.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **c5c6+** is the best. It is a forcing check, and if Black takes, White wins material with a fork.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nc5c6\n```"
