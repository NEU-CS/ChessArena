When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White's king is on f1, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's queen is on g3, eyeing f2 and g1. Black's rook is on d2, controlling the second rank. Bishop on f2, pinning the knight on f3 to the king.\n- Black has a strong attack. White's king is vulnerable.\n\n#### Candidate Moves\nLet's look at the legal moves and see if there is a forced mate or a decisive attack.\n\n##### 1. **g3g1** (Queen to g1)\n- This is a check.\n- White's only legal move is Nxg1 (since the king can't move to e2, e1, f2, g2, or h1 due to Black's pieces).\n- After Nxg1, Black can play Rd1# (rook to d1, checkmate).\n- Let's check this line:\n    - 1...Qg1+ 2.Nxg1 Rd1# (checkmate)\n\n##### 2. **g3g2** (Queen to g2)\n- This is not check, but threatens Qf2#.\n- White can respond with Rxg2 or Qb8+ (trying to check Black's king).\n- Not as forcing as Qg1+.\n\n##### 3. **f2g1** (Bishop takes on g1)\n- This is check.\n- White can capture with the knight: Nxg1.\n- Not as forcing as Qg1+.\n\n##### 4. **d2d1** (Rook to d1)\n- This is check.\n- White can block with the queen: Qxd1.\n- Not as forcing.\n\n##### 5. **Other moves**\n- None seem as forcing as Qg1+.\n\n### Conclusion\n**Qg1+** is a forced mate in two. Let's confirm:\n\n1...Qg1+  \n2.Nxg1 Rd1#\n\nWhite is checkmated. This is the best move.\n\n---\n\n**Final move in UCI notation:**\n```\ng3g1\n```"
