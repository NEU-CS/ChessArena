When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Qxf2 (forced) Rxf2+ 38. Kg1 Rc2 (threatening Rc1#)\n    - But White has Bd1 or Qg5+.\n\n#### 10. **Rc1 (c4c1)**\n- Not possible.\n\n#### 11. **Rc2 (c4c2)**\n- Attacks f2, but White can defend.\n\n#### 12. **Qh4 (f6h4)**\n- Threatens mate, but White can play g4.\n\n#### 13. **Qxf2+ (f6f2)**\n- Let's analyze this line more deeply:\n\n##### Line: 36...Qxf2+ 37. Qxf2 Rxf2+ 38. Kg1 Rc2\n- Now, Rc1# is threatened.\n- If White plays Bd1, then Black can play Rc1, and after Qxc1, Bxc1, Black is up a piece.\n- If White plays Ra8, then Rc1+ is still dangerous.\n\n##### Line: 36...Qxf2+ 37. Qxf2 Rxf2+ 38. Kg1 Rc2 39. Ra8 (to block Rc1#)\n- Rc1+ 40. Bd1 Rxd1#\n\nThis is a forced mate!\n\n### Conclusion\n**The move 36...Qxf2+ is a forced win for Black.**\n\n### Final Move\n```\nf6f2\n```"
