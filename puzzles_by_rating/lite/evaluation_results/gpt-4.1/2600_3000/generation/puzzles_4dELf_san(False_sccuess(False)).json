When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White cannot stop both a2 and b2 threats easily.\n  - White's bishop is on c1 and cannot stop the a-pawn from queening after a3-a2.\n  - White's king is too far to help.\n  - White may try to play bxa3, but then b2 and the b-pawn will queen.\n\n- **Bishop moves:**  \n  - Moving the bishop to support the pawn push is possible, but a4a3 is more direct.\n\n- **King moves:**  \n  - No immediate threats to the king; no need to move.\n\n**Tactical check:**\n- Is there any way White can stop the pawn after a4a3?\n  - If White plays bxa3, then b2 and the pawn will promote.\n  - If White ignores, a3-a2 and then a1=Q or b2-b1=Q is unstoppable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to push the a-pawn with **a4a3**. This creates an unstoppable passed pawn and should lead to a win for Black.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\na4a3\n```"
