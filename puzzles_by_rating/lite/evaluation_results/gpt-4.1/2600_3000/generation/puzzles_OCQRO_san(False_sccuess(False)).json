When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \nr1b1qrk1/2p3pp/p1pbpn2/3p2N1/3P4/2P5/PP1NQPPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 2 14\n\n**White to move.**\n\n### 1. **Material Count**\n- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns\n- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 7 Pawns\n- Material is equal.\n\n### 2. **King Safety**\n- Both kings are relatively safe, but Black's king is slightly more exposed due to the fianchettoed bishop missing and the knight on f6 being a potential target.\n\n### 3. **Piece Activity**\n- White's knight on g5 is very active, eyeing e6, f7, and h7.\n- White's queen is centralized on e2.\n- White's bishop on c1 is undeveloped, but could come to g5 or f4 soon.\n- Black's pieces are mostly developed, but the bishop on c8 is blocked.\n\n### 4. **Tactical Opportunities**\nLet's look for tactical shots, especially with the knight on g5.\n\n#### **Candidate Moves**\n- **g5e6**: Knight takes pawn, attacking queen and bishop. But f8xe6 is possible.\n- **g5f7**: Knight forks queen and rook, but g5f7 is not possible because the knight is not supported.\n- **g5h7**: Knight attacks rook, but after h7h6, knight must retreat.\n- **e2e6**: Queen sacrifice, but after bishop takes, nothing immediate.\n- **d2f3**: Developing, but not threatening.\n- **e2e4**: Central push, but not forcing.\n- **e2h5**: Queen to h5, threatening mate on h7, but knight on f6 covers h7.\n- **e2e5**: Queen to e5, attacking bishop and knight, but both are defended.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: g5e6**\n- 1. Ng5xe6 Qxe6 (or Rxe6 or Bxe6)\n- If Qxe6, then Qxe6 Rxe6, nothing immediate.\n- If fxe6, then Qxe6+ Kh8, Nf3, nothing immediate.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: g5f7**\n- 1. Ng5xf7 Rxf7 (or Qxf7)\n- No follow-up.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: e2e6**\n- 1. Qe6+ Bxe6, nothing.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: e2h5**\n- 1. Qh5 h6 (forced), Ndf3 or Nf3, but nothing immediate.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: d2e4**\n- 1. Nde4 dxe4, Qxe4, not much.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: d2f3**\n- 1. Ndf3, develops, supports e5, but not threatening.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: e2e4**\n- 1. Qe4, attacks h7, but knight on f6 covers.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: e2f3**\n- 1. Qf3, attacks f6, but not much.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: h2h3**\n- 1. h3, gives luft, but not urgent.\n\n#### **Tactical Calculation: c3c4**\n- 1. c4, attacks d5, but dxc4, Nxc4, not much.\n\n### 5. **Best Move Candidates**\nThe most promising are:\n- **g5e6**: Knight takes pawn, attacks queen and bishop, but after fxe6, nothing immediate.\n- **d2f3**: Develops knight, supports e5, and prepares to bring rook to e1.\n- **e2e6**: Queen sacrifice, but not working.\n- **e2h5**: Queen to h5, but h6 defends.\n\n### 6. **Deep Calculation: g5e6**\nLet's look again:\n- 1. Ng5xe6 Rxe6 (or Qxe6)\n- 2. Qxe6+ Bxe6\n- No follow-up.\n\n### 7. **Deep Calculation: d2f3**\n- 1. Ndf3, develops, supports e5, and if Black plays h6, then Nf3 can go to e5 or h4.\n\n### 8. **Strategic Considerations**\n- White should develop the bishop on c1 and connect the rooks.\n- The knight on g5 is active, but not delivering a blow yet.\n- Developing the knight to f3 is solid, supports the center, and prepares for future attacks.\n\n### 9. **Final Decision**\n**d2f3** is the best move. It develops a piece, supports the center, and keeps all tactical threats alive. It also prepares for Re1 and possibly Ne5 in the future.\n\n## **Final Move**\n```\nd2f3\n```"
