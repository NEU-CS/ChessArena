When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's king is active on b4, White's king is on c2.\n- Black has a queenside pawn majority (a7), but White has a kingside pawn majority and more advanced pawns on the kingside.\n- Black's pawns on the kingside are advanced but could become weak if White can break through.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n- c2d3, c2d2, c2b2, c2d1, c2c1, c2b1 (king moves)\n- f4g5 (pawn captures pawn)\n- f4f5 (pawn advances)\n- e4e5 (pawn advances)\n- h3h4 (pawn advances)\n- g3g4 (pawn advances)\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **f4g5**: Captures Black's pawn on g5. This is a forcing move and opens the kingside. After f4xg5, Black can respond with fxg5, but then White can play h4 and try to create a passed pawn.\n2. **f4f5**: Advances the pawn, but Black can respond with gxf4, and White's kingside majority is less effective.\n3. **e4e5**: Advances the pawn, but Black can respond with fxe5, and White's center is weakened.\n4. **h3h4**: Advances the pawn, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.\n5. **g3g4**: Advances the pawn, but Black can respond with h4, closing the kingside.\n6. **King moves**: Moving the king doesn't seem to improve White's position immediately.\n\n**Deep analysis of f4g5:**\n- 31. f4g5 fxg5\n- 32. h4! (threatening h5 and creating a passed pawn)\n- If Black plays g4, then White can play e5 and try to break through.\n- If Black does nothing, White can play h5 and g4, creating a passed pawn.\n\n**Deep analysis of f4f5:**\n- 31. f4f5 gxf4\n- 32. gxf4 (now White has a 2 vs 1 on the kingside, but Black's king is active on b4 and can try to attack the b3 pawn)\n\n**Deep analysis of e4e5:**\n- 31. e4e5 fxe5\n- 32. fxe5 (now White has a passed pawn, but Black's king is still active)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **f4g5** is the most forcing move, immediately removing one of Black's advanced pawns and opening the kingside for White's majority. This gives White the best chance to create a passed pawn and win.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf4g5\n```"
