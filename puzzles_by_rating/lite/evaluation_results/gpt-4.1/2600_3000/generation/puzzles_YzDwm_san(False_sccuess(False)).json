When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n5k1r/6p1/p2p1n2/1p1PpP2/1P2P3/P2B3q/2Q3R1/2N3K1 w - - 9 36\n\n**White to move.**\n\n### Material Count\n- White: Queen (c2), Rook (g2), Bishop (d3), Knight (c1), Pawns (a3, b4, d5, e4, f5, g2), King (g1)\n- Black: Queen (h3), Rook (h8), Knight (f6), Pawns (a6, b5, d6, e5, g7), King (f8)\n\n### King Safety\n- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed, but defended by knight and pawns.\n- White's king is on g1, relatively safe for now.\n\n### Threats\n- Black's queen on h3 is aggressive, but not immediately threatening mate.\n- White has a strong center and potential for attack.\n\n### Candidate Moves\nLet's look at the most forcing moves first (checks, captures, threats):\n\n#### 1. **g2g7** (Rook to g7, check)\n- This is a check.\n- Black can reply with Knight blocking (f6g8), or King moves (f8g8), or Rook blocks (h8g8).\n- Let's see the lines:\n    - 1. g2g7 Kf8xg7 (if king takes, White can continue attack, but loses rook)\n    - 1. g2g7 ... Nf6g8 (blocks, but then White can continue with Qc8+ or Qc7+)\n    - 1. g2g7 ... Rh8g8 (blocks, but then White can play Qc8+)\n\n#### 2. **Qc2c8+** (Queen to c8, check)\n- Immediate check, but Black can block with knight (Ne8), or move king.\n\n#### 3. **d3f1** (Bishop to f1, defending g2 and h3 squares)\n- Defensive, but not pressing advantage.\n\n#### 4. **a3a4** (pawn push)\n- Not forcing, doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n#### 5. **c2c8** (Queen to c8, not check)\n- Not as forcing as Qc8+.\n\n#### 6. **c1b3** (Knight to b3)\n- Not forcing.\n\n#### 7. **d3b5** (Bishop to b5)\n- Attacks rook on h8, but not forcing.\n\n#### 8. **c2c7** (Queen to c7)\n- Threatens mate on f7, but Black can defend.\n\n### Most Forcing: **g2g7**\nLet's analyze this move in detail:\n\n#### 1. g2g7\n\n##### a) 1... Kf8xg7\n- White loses the rook, but after Qc7+ (forking king and knight), White can regain material and continue attack.\n\n##### b) 1... Nf6g8\n- Blocks the check, but then White can play Qc8+ (threatening mate), and Black is forced to give up material.\n\n##### c) 1... Rh8g8\n- Blocks, but then White can play Qc8+.\n\n#### 2. Qc2c8+ (immediate check)\n- Black plays Ne8, and the attack fizzles.\n\n#### 3. Qc2c7 (threatens mate on f7)\n- Black can play Ne8, defending f7.\n\n### Calculation of g2g7\n\n1. g2g7 Nf6g8  \n   2. Qc8+ Kf7  \n   3. Qe6# (Checkmate!)\n\n**This is a forced mate in 2 after g2g7 if Black blocks with Nf6g8!**\n\nIf Black tries 1... Rh8g8:\n- 2. Qc8+ Ne8 (only move)\n- 3. Qxe8# (Checkmate!)\n\nIf Black takes the rook:\n- 1... Kxg7\n- 2. Qc7+ (forking king and knight)\n- 2... Nd7 (only move)\n- 3. Qxd7+ Kf8\n- 4. Qd8+ Kf7\n- 5. Qxh8 (White is up a queen for a rook and has a winning position)\n\n### Conclusion\n**g2g7** is the best move, as it leads to forced mate or decisive material gain.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng2g7\n```"
