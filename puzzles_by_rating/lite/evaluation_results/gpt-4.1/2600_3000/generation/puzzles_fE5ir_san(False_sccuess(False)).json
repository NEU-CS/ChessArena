When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material Count\n- White: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 7 pawns\n- Black: Queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 1 knight, 7 pawns\n\nWhite is up a piece (White has both knights, Black only one).\n\n### 2. King Safety\n- Black's king is on c8, queenside, with some pawn cover but open lines.\n- White's king is on d1, relatively safe.\n\n### 3. Piece Activity\n- White's pieces are very active, especially the knights and bishops.\n- Black's pieces are somewhat cramped.\n\n### 4. Threats and Tactics\n- White's knight on h7 attacks the f8 square and can jump to g5 or f6.\n- The knight on e4 is centralized and can jump to f6, g5, or d6.\n- The bishop on d3 is eyeing the a6-f1 diagonal.\n- The queen on c2 is well placed, possibly eyeing the c-file or kingside.\n\n#### Candidate Moves:\nLet's look at the most forcing moves first:\n\n#### a) **h7f8**\n- Nxf8 attacks the queen on c7 and threatens to win the exchange (rook on h8).\n- If Black plays Bxf8, White can recapture with the queen or bishop.\n\n#### b) **e4f6**\n- Nf6+ is a check. Black can respond with Bxf6 or gxf6.\n- If Bxf6, then Bxf5+ is possible, but Black can block with Kb8 or Rd7.\n\n#### c) **e4g5**\n- Ng5 attacks e6 and f7, but doesn't seem immediately threatening.\n\n#### d) **h7f6**\n- Nxf6+ is a check. Black can respond with Bxf6 or gxf6.\n- If Bxf6, then Nxf6, and White has a strong attack.\n\n#### e) **d3f5**\n- Bxf5 is not a legal move, as the bishop is on d3.\n\n#### f) **d3a6**\n- Ba6+ is a check. Black can block with Kb8 or Rd7.\n\n#### g) **d3b5**\n- Bb5 attacks the queen on c7 and pins the knight on c6.\n\n#### h) **c2a4**\n- Qa4 attacks the knight on c6 and possibly threatens Ba6.\n\n#### i) **c2e2**\n- Queen centralizes, but not very forcing.\n\n#### j) **g2g4**\n- Pawn push, not forcing.\n\n### 5. Forcing Moves Analysis\n\n#### **h7f8 (Nxf8)**\n- Nxf8 attacks the queen on c7 and threatens to win the exchange.\n- If Black plays Bxf8, White can recapture with the queen or bishop.\n- If Black ignores, White can take the rook on h8.\n\n#### **e4f6 (Nf6+)**\n- Nf6+ is a check.\n- If Bxf6, then Nxf6, and White's knight is very strong.\n- If gxf6, then Bxf5+ is possible, but Black can block.\n\n#### **h7f6 (Nxf6+)**\n- Nxf6+ is a check.\n- If Bxf6, then Nxf6+, and White can continue the attack.\n\n#### **d3a6 (Ba6+)**\n- Ba6+ is a check.\n- Black can block with Kb8 or Rd7.\n\n#### **d3b5 (Bb5)**\n- Bb5 attacks the queen and pins the knight.\n\n### 6. Best Move\n\nLet's calculate **h7f8 (Nxf8)** in detail:\n- 19. Nxf8 Bxf8 (if Black recaptures)\n- 20. Nc5 (attacks b7 and threatens mate ideas)\n- White is up the exchange and keeps the initiative.\n\nAlternatively, **e4f6 (Nf6+)**:\n- 19. Nf6+ Bxf6 (forced)\n- 20. Nxf6 (threatens mate on e8)\n- If ...gxf6, then Bxf5+ and White's attack continues.\n\nBut **h7f8** wins the exchange immediately and keeps up the pressure.\n\n### 7. Conclusion\n\n**Best move:**  \n```\nh7f8\n```"
