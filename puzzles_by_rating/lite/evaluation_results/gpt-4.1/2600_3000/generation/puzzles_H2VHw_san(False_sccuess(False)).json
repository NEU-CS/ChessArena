When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \nh7h8, h7g7, h7h6, b4f8, b4e7, b4d6, b4c5, b4a5, b4c3, b4a3, b4d2, b4e1, g6g5, h5h4\n\n**Material count:**  \n- Black: King (h7), Bishop (b4), pawns (g6, h5)\n- White: King (e6), Knight (e5), pawn (f7), pawn (h3)\n\n**Immediate threats:**  \n- White is threatening to promote f7-f8=Q next move.  \n- Black must prevent or delay this, or create counterplay.\n\n**Candidate moves analysis:**\n\n1. **h7h8, h7g7, h7h6:**  \n  - King moves do not address the promotion threat or create counterplay.\n\n2. **b4f8:**  \n  - Bishop to f8 attacks the f7 pawn directly. If White promotes, Black can capture the new queen with Bxf8. This is a direct way to stop the promotion.\n\n3. **b4e7:**  \n  - Bishop to e7 attacks the knight and covers f8, but after f7-f8=Q, Bxf8, White can recapture with the king (Kxf8), and White is up a piece.\n\n4. **b4d6:**  \n  - Bishop to d6 attacks the knight and covers f8, but White can still promote.\n\n5. **b4c5, b4a5, b4c3, b4a3, b4d2, b4e1:**  \n  - These bishop moves don't address the immediate threat.\n\n6. **g6g5, h5h4:**  \n  - Pawn moves do not address the promotion threat.\n\n**Critical line:**\n\n- If **b4f8** is played:\n  - If White plays f7-f8=Q, then Bxf8 and the threat is neutralized.\n  - If White tries to support the pawn with Kf6, Black can still play Bxf7.\n  - If White tries to move the knight, the pawn is still under attack.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe only move that prevents immediate loss is **b4f8**. All other moves allow White to promote and win easily.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb4f8\n```"
