When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \n- e2e3 (King from e2 to e3)\n- e2d2 (King from e2 to d2)\n- d1d3 (Rook from d1 to d3)\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **e2e3** (King to e3)\n- The king moves to e3, but this square is attacked by Black's bishop on e5 and rook on d8. This move is illegal because the king would move into check. However, the list says it's legal, so let's check:\n    - Bishop on e5 attacks e3.\n    - Rook on d8 attacks e3 via the d-file.\n    - So, e2e3 is not a safe move; it puts the king in check.\n\n### 2. **e2d2** (King to d2)\n- The king moves to d2.\n- Let's check if d2 is attacked:\n    - Black's rook on d8 attacks d2.\n    - So, d2 is attacked by the rook. This move would also put the king in check.\n\n### 3. **d1d3** (Rook from d1 to d3)\n- The rook moves from d1 to d3.\n- This is a defensive move, possibly to block the d-file and protect the king from checks along the d-file.\n- Let's see if this move is safe:\n    - The rook on d3 blocks the d-file, so the king is not in check.\n    - The rook is not attacked immediately on d3.\n    - This move also defends the e3 square, so the king may have an escape route.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- Both king moves (e2e3 and e2d2) move into check and are illegal in a normal chess game, but since they are listed as legal, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the FEN or move generation. However, by chess rules, the only safe and legal move is **d1d3**.\n\n### **Best Move**\n\n```\nd1d3\n```"
