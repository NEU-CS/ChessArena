When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \ng7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7h6, d7d4, f7f6\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n- **Material:**  \n  Black: Queen (d7), Knight (c5), Pawns (b6, g6, h5)  \n  White: Queen (b2), Bishop (c2), Pawns (e3, f2, g2), King (f1)\n\n- **King Safety:**  \n  Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed but not under immediate threat.  \n  White's king is on f1, relatively safe.\n\n- **Candidate Moves Analysis:**\n\n1. **g7g8** (King to g8): Retreats king to the back rank, but doesn't address any threats or create counterplay.\n2. **g7f8** (King to f8): Retreats king, but same as above.\n3. **g7h7** (King to h7): Moves king to the corner, but doesn't change much.\n4. **g7h6** (King to h6): King steps forward, but could be exposed to checks.\n5. **d7d4** (Queen to d4): This is a very active move, attacking e3 and f2, and centralizing the queen. Also, it threatens Qxb2 if White's queen moves.\n6. **f7f6** (Pawn to f6): This move gives the king an escape square and restricts White's bishop, but weakens the e6 square and doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n**Tactical Considerations:**\n\n- **d7d4** is the most aggressive and active move. It attacks e3 (which is only defended by the king) and f2 (which is defended by the king and queen). It also keeps the queen centralized and threatens to invade White's position.\n- The king moves (g7g8, g7f8, g7h7, g7h6) are all passive and do not improve Black's position.\n- **f7f6** is a defensive move, but not necessary right now as there are no immediate threats to the king.\n\n**Double-checking for tactics:**\n\n- After **d7d4**, if White plays exd4, Black can recapture with the knight (c5xd4), further centralizing the knight and attacking the bishop on c2.\n- If White ignores the queen and tries to attack, Black's queen is very active and can create threats against White's king and pawns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**d7d4** is the best move. It is active, creates threats, and keeps the initiative with Black.\n\n**Final move in UCI notation:**\n```\nd7d4\n```"
