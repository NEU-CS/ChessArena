When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n2Qn2k1/p3qppp/1p6/1b1B4/6P1/7P/P4r2/R1R4K w - - 1 29\n\n**White to move.**\n\n### 1. Material Count\n- **White:** Queen (c8), Rook (c1), Rook (a1), Bishop (d5), Pawns (a2, g4, h3, h2)\n- **Black:** Queen (e7), Rook (f2), Bishop (b5), Knight (d8), King (g8), Pawns (a7, b6, g7, h7)\n\nWhite is up the exchange (two rooks for rook and knight), but Black has some activity.\n\n### 2. King Safety\n- **White King:** h1, relatively safe for now.\n- **Black King:** g8, somewhat exposed.\n\n### 3. Threats\n- **White:** The queen on c8 is very active, and the bishop on d5 is strong, eyeing the diagonal.\n- **Black:** The rook on f2 is active, and the queen on e7 is centralized.\n\n### 4. Tactics\nLet's look for forcing moves: checks, captures, threats.\n\n#### Candidate Moves:\n- **c8d8:** Queen check. If ...Nf7, then Qxe7.\n- **c8b8, c8a8:** Queen checks, but less forcing.\n- **d5f7:** Bishop captures pawn with check. If ...Nxf7, then Qxe7.\n- **d5e6:** Bishop attacks queen and rook.\n- **c1c7:** Rook to 7th rank, attacking b7 and g7.\n- **g4g5:** Pawn push, but not forcing.\n- **h3h4:** Pawn push, not forcing.\n\n#### Let's calculate the most forcing lines:\n\n#### **1. c8d8+**\n- Black can respond with Nf7, blocking the check.\n- Then Qxe7 wins the queen.\n\n#### **2. d5f7+**\n- If ...Nxf7, then Qxe7 wins the queen.\n- If ...Kf8, then Qxe7+ wins the queen.\n\n#### **3. d5e6**\n- Attacks queen and rook, but not a check.\n\n#### **4. c1c7**\n- Attacks b7 and g7, but not a check.\n\n### 5. Calculation of Forcing Lines\n\n#### **Line 1: c8d8+**\n1. c8d8+ Nf7 (forced)\n2. Qxe7 (wins the queen)\n\n#### **Line 2: d5f7+**\n1. d5f7+ Nxf7 (forced)\n2. Qxe7 (wins the queen)\n\n#### **Line 3: d5e6**\n- Not a check, Black can move queen or rook.\n\n#### **Line 4: c1c7**\n- Not a check, Black can respond.\n\n### 6. Evaluation\n\nBoth **c8d8+** and **d5f7+** win the queen for a bishop or knight, which is a decisive material advantage.\n\nBut **d5f7+** is a check and forces the knight to move, after which Qxe7 wins the queen. This also removes a defender from the Black king, increasing mating chances.\n\n### 7. Final Decision\n\nBetween **c8d8+** and **d5f7+**, both win the queen, but **d5f7+** is more forcing and removes a defender from the king.\n\n### **Best Move:**\n```\nd5f7\n```"
