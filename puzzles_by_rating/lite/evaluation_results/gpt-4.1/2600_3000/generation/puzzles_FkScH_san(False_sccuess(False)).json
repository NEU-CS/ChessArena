When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Nxe6+ Kb6\n- Queen can go to g5+.\n- King to a6, then Qxa5+.\n- King to b7, then Qg7+.\n\n#### 3b. Nxe6+ Kc8\n- Queen to g8+ is mate.\n\n### 4. **g4e6** (Qxe6)\n- Queen takes bishop, but not with check.\n- Black can respond with ...Rh1+ or ...Rh6.\n\n### 5. **g5h7** (Ng7+)\n- Knight to h7 is not check.\n\n### 6. **g4h5** (Qh5)\n- Not a check, not a capture.\n\n---\n\n## Let's calculate the most forcing line: **g4c8+**\n\n1. Qc8+ Kxc8\n2. Nxd6+ Kd7 (only move)\n3. Nxb7 (winning a piece and attacking the rook on h2)\n\nBut after 1...Kxc8, White is up a piece and has a strong attack.\n\n---\n\n## Let's check **g5e6+** (Nxe6+):\n\n1. Nxe6+ Kb6 (only move)\n2. Qg5 (check)\n   - King to a6\n   - Qxa5+ Kb7\n   - Qg7+ Kb6\n   - Qc7+ Kb5\n   - a4+ Kxa4\n   - b3+ Kb4\n   - Ra4#\n\nBut let's check if this is forced mate.\n\n1. Nxe6+ Kb6\n2. Qg5 a6 (trying to escape)\n3. Qd8+ Kb5\n4. a4+ Kxa4\n5. b3+ Kb4\n6. Ra4#\n\nThis is a forced mate in 6.\n\n---\n\n## Let's check **g4d7+** (Qd7+):\n\n1. Qd7+ Kxd7\n2. Nf7 (forking king and bishop)\n   - King moves, knight takes bishop, but not as strong as the previous line.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Nxe6+** leads to a forced mate, while Qc8+ wins material but not immediately. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5e6\n```"
