When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:**  \n2r1r1k1/2b2pB1/p4P2/2pp3p/1p1P4/2P2R1P/PP6/R6K b - - 3 32\n\n**Black to move.**\n\n### Material Count\n- Black: Rooks on c8 and e8, Bishop on c7, pawns on a6, b4, c5, d5, h5, king on g8, f7 pawn.\n- White: Rook on f3, Bishop on g7, pawns on a2, b2, c3, d4, f6, h3, king on h1, rook on a1.\n\n### Immediate Threats\n- White's f6 pawn is very dangerous, threatening f6-f7 and possibly f7-f8=Q.\n- White's bishop on g7 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal and supporting f6.\n- Black's king is relatively safe for now, but White's pressure is building.\n- Black's bishop on c7 is somewhat passive but controls some key squares.\n- Black's rooks are on open files, but White's rook on f3 is pressuring f7.\n\n### Candidate Moves\nLet's look at the legal moves and consider their implications:\n\n#### 1. King Moves\n- `g8h7`: Moves king to h7, but doesn't address the threat on f7. Could walk into a mating net if not careful.\n\n#### 2. Rook Moves\n- `e8f8`: Defends f7, but blocks the c8 rook and doesn't create counterplay.\n- `e8d8`, `e8e7`, `e8e6`, `e8e5`, `e8e4`, `e8e3`, `e8e2`, `e8e1`: Various rook moves along the e-file. Most don't address the immediate threat.\n- `c8d8`, `c8b8`, `c8a8`: Lateral rook moves, not immediately useful.\n- `c7d8`, `c7b8`, `c7d6`, `c7b6`, `c7e5`, `c7a5`, `c7f4`, `c7g3`, `c7h2`: Bishop moves, some could be defensive.\n\n#### 3. Pawn Moves\n- `c5d4`: Captures White's pawn on d4, opening the c-file and possibly giving Black some counterplay.\n- `b4c3`: Captures White's pawn on c3, but after bxc3, White's center is still strong.\n- `a6a5`: Not relevant to the immediate threats.\n- `h5h4`: Could try to create counterplay on the kingside, but slow.\n- `c5c4`: Advances the c-pawn, but White's d4 pawn is strong.\n- `b4b3`: Advances the b-pawn, but not immediately threatening.\n\n### Most Critical Threat\nWhite is threatening to push f6-f7, and if Black does nothing, White can play Rg1-g7, doubling on the g-file, or Rf3-f5, attacking the h5 pawn and supporting f7.\n\n### Defensive Resources\n- `e8e2`: Rook to e2 attacks White's pawns on b2 and h2, but doesn't defend f7.\n- `e8f8`: Defends f7 directly.\n- `c5d4`: Captures on d4, opening the c-file and possibly giving counterplay.\n\n### Calculation\n\n#### If 1... e8f8\n- White can play Rg1-g1, doubling on the g-file, or Rf3-f5, attacking h5.\n- Black is passive but holds for now.\n\n#### If 1... c5d4\n- 2. cxd4 (White recaptures)\n- Now, Black can try to activate the rook via c8-c2 or e8-e2, but White's threats remain.\n\n#### If 1... e8e2\n- 2. Rg1 (White doubles on the g-file)\n- Black can try to take on b2, but White's attack is dangerous.\n\n#### If 1... c7f4\n- Bishop attacks rook on f3, forcing it to move.\n- If Rxf4, Bxf4, White loses the exchange, but White's f6 pawn is still dangerous.\n\n#### If 1... c7g3\n- Bishop attacks rook on f3, but Rg1 and White is still pressing.\n\n### Best Move\n\nThe move `c7f4` attacks the rook on f3, forcing it to move. If White exchanges, Black's bishop becomes more active, and the pressure on f6 is slightly reduced. This is the most active defense, and it forces White to make a decision.\n\n### Final Move\n\n```\nc7f4\n```"
