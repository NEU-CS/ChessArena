When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step:\n\n**FEN:** 6b1/6P1/3k1KB1/8/8/7p/8/8 w - - 0 58  \nWhite to move.\n\n**White pieces:**\n- King on f6\n- Bishop on g6\n- Pawn on g7\n\n**Black pieces:**\n- King on d6\n- Bishop on g8\n- Pawn on h3\n\n**Legal moves:**\n- g6e8\n- g6h7\n- g6f7\n- g6h5\n- g6f5\n- g6e4\n- g6d3\n- g6c2\n- g6b1\n- f6g5\n- f6f5\n\nLet's consider the position:\n\n- White is up a pawn and has a very advanced g7 pawn, threatening to promote.\n- Black's king is far from the g7 pawn and cannot stop it directly.\n- Black's bishop is on g8, controlling the g8 square, but the pawn is on g7, so promotion is possible if the bishop is distracted or blocked.\n- White's king is very active on f6.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n\n1. **g6e8** (Bishop to e8): This attacks the bishop on g8, but the bishop is not on e8, so this is just a repositioning. It also covers the promotion square.\n2. **g6h7** (Bishop to h7): This move doesn't seem to do much.\n3. **g6f7** (Bishop to f7): This supports the pawn's promotion, but the bishop on g8 still controls g8.\n4. **g6h5** (Bishop to h5): Not threatening much.\n5. **g6f5** (Bishop to f5): Not threatening much.\n6. **g6e4** (Bishop to e4): Not threatening much.\n7. **g6d3** (Bishop to d3): Not threatening much.\n8. **g6c2** (Bishop to c2): Not threatening much.\n9. **g6b1** (Bishop to b1): Not threatening much.\n10. **f6g5** (King to g5): Moves the king closer to the h3 pawn, but doesn't help promote the g7 pawn immediately.\n11. **f6f5** (King to f5): Similar, but less active.\n\n**Key idea:** The g7 pawn is one step from promotion, but the Black bishop controls g8. If we can force the bishop away or block it, we can promote.\n\n**Critical calculation:**\n\n- If we play **g6e8**, the bishop now covers g8. If Black plays ...h2, we can play **g7g8Q** (promote), and if Black plays ...Bf7, we can play **Kxf7** and promote.\n- If we play **g6f7**, the bishop supports the pawn, but the Black bishop still controls g8.\n\nBut let's look at **g6e8**:\n\n1. g6e8 (Bishop to e8)\n   - If Black plays ...h2, we play g7g8Q, and if ...Bf7, Kxf7 and promote.\n   - If Black does nothing, we can promote next move.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**g6e8** is the best move. It covers the promotion square and ensures the pawn will promote next move, as Black cannot stop it.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng6e8\n```"
