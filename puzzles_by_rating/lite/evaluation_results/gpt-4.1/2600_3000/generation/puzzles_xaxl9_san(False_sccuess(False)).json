When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If Black doesn't stop it, White will promote.\n- The only way to stop the a7 pawn is to check the White king, so it can't support the promotion, or to attack the a7 pawn directly.\n\n**Check for checks:**\n- **c6c8**: Rook to c8, blocks the a8 square, but White can play d7, threatening promotion.\n- **c6c7**: Rook to c7, attacks a7, but White can play d7, and after Rxd7, Kxd7, a7 promotes.\n- **c6d6**: Rook takes d6, but White can play a8=Q.\n\n**Is there any way to stop the a7 pawn?**\n- **c6c8**: After this, if White plays d7, then Rb8, but White can play axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q, and White will have a queen.\n\n**What about perpetual check?**\n- If Black plays c6c8, and White plays d7, then Black can play Rb8, and after axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q, White will have a queen, but Black can try to check the White king.\n\n**Is there any way to draw?**\n- If Black plays c6c8, White plays d7, Black plays Rb8, White plays axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q, Black can try to check the White king, but White's king is very safe.\n\n**What about c6c7?**\n- c6c7, White plays d7, Black plays Rxd7, White plays Kxd7, and then a7 promotes.\n\n**What about c6b6?**\n- c6b6, White plays d7, Black plays Rb8, White plays axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q, same as above.\n\n**What about c6c5?**\n- c6c5, White plays d7, Black plays Rb5, White plays axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q.\n\n**What about c6c4?**\n- c6c4, White plays d7, Black plays Rb4, White plays axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q.\n\n**What about c6c3?**\n- c6c3, White plays d7, Black plays Rb3, White plays axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q.\n\n**What about c6c2?**\n- c6c2, White plays d7, Black plays Rb2, White plays axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q.\n\n**What about c6c1?**\n- c6c1, White plays d7, Black plays Rb1, White plays axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q.\n\n**What about f7f6?**\n- f7f6, White plays a8=Q+ Kxa8 d7, and White will promote.\n\n**What about h6h5?**\n- h6h5, White plays a8=Q+ Kxa8 d7, and White will promote.\n\n**What about g5g4?**\n- g5g4, White plays a8=Q+ Kxa8 d7, and White will promote.\n\n**What about f7f5?**\n- f7f5, White plays a8=Q+ Kxa8 d7, and White will promote.\n\n**What about a8b7?**\n- a8b7, White plays a8=Q+ Kxa8 d7, and White will promote.\n\n**What about c6d6?**\n- c6d6, White plays a8=Q+ Kxa8 d7, and White will promote.\n\n**Is there any way to stop the a7 pawn?**\n- The only way is to check the White king to force it away from the a7 pawn.\n- But the rook cannot check the king from c6.\n\n**What about c6c8?**\n- c6c8, White plays d7, Black plays Rb8, White plays axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q.\n\n**Is there any stalemate trick?**\n- If Black plays c6c8, and White plays d7, Black plays Rb8, White plays axb8=Q+ Rxb8 d8=Q, Black is lost.\n\n**Is there any move that delays White's promotion?**\n- c6c8 is the only move that prevents immediate a8=Q.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is to play c6c8, to at least delay White's promotion and hope for a mistake.**\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nc6c8\n```"
