When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

For example, ...Bd6 attacks the queen, but White can just play Qe2 or Qh5.\n- ...Qh4 or ...Qg5 don't seem to create any threats.\n\n#### c) **Other Defensive Moves**\n- ...Kh8 or ...g6 don't help.\n\n#### d) **Exchange**\n- ...Nxc3 dxc3 is possible, but then we lose the knight and White's center is strong.\n\n### 6. **Best Defensive Move**\nThe only way to not lose material immediately is to defend the knight on d5.\n\n- **...Be6** (c8e6): This move develops a piece and defends the knight on d5. Now, if White plays Qxe6, Black can recapture with f7xe6, and the knight is still defended.\n\n### 7. **Check for Tactics**\n- After ...Be6, does White have any immediate threats? Not really; the knight is now defended twice.\n- White could try to increase pressure, but Black is not losing material immediately.\n\n### 8. **Final Decision**\nThe best move is to defend the knight and develop a piece:\n\n```\nc8e6\n```"
