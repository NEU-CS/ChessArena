When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Not a check.\n\n#### 2. **f4f8** (Rook to f8)\n- This is a check. Black must respond.\n\n#### 3. **c2f5** (Queen to f5)\n- Attacks the bishop on g7 and threatens mate on h7, but the bishop is defended by the king.\n\n#### 4. **b4b5** (Pawn push)\n- Attacks the queen, but not forcing.\n\n#### 5. **g2g3** (Pawn move)\n- Not forcing.\n\n#### 6. **e6f5** (Bishop takes on f5)\n- Captures a pawn, not forcing.\n\n#### 7. **c2e4** (Queen to e4)\n- Attacks the queen, but Black's queen is defended.\n\n#### 8. **f4f7** (Rook to f7)\n- Attacks the bishop on g7, but not a check.\n\n#### 9. **c2d3** (Queen to d3)\n- Attacks the queen, but not forcing.\n\n### Most Forcing Move: **f4f8**\n\n- **f4f8** is a check. Let's see how Black can respond:\n  - Only legal move is **Bxf8** (bishop captures rook).\n  - After **Bxf8**, White can play **Qxc3** (queen takes knight), winning a piece.\n  - Alternatively, after **f4f8 Bxf8**, White can play **Qf5** threatening mate on h7.\n\n### Calculation after **f4f8 Bxf8 Qf5**\n\n- Threatens **Qh7#** (mate).\n- Black cannot defend h7 with the queen or rook.\n- Only defense is **Qf6** (blocking), but then **Qxf6+** and White wins.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**f4f8** is a decisive move, forcing Black to give up material and leading to a quick mate or massive material gain.\n\n---\n\n## Final Move\n\n```\nf4f8\n```"
