When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If White ignores it, Black will play h1=Q next move. White must address this.\n\n**Best way to address h2:**\n- **g3h3** attacks the pawn directly. If Black plays gxh3, White can recapture with the queen or king, and the pawn is gone.\n- If Black ignores, White can play Rxh2 next move.\n\n**Let's check for tactics:**\n- After g3h3, if Black plays gxh3, White can play Qh5, threatening mate on h7 and h8.\n- If Black plays h1=Q, White plays Rxh1, and the pawn is gone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**g3h3** is the best move. It directly addresses the immediate threat, keeps White in the game, and gives chances for counterplay.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng3h3\n```"
