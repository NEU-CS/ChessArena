When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Legal moves:**  \n- e5d5 (King from e5 to d5)\n- e5f4 (King from e5 to f4)\n- e5d4 (King from e5 to d4)\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n- **Material:**  \n  - Black: King (e5), Knight (g1), Rook (b2), Pawn (e2), Pawn (h7), Pawn (g6)\n  - White: King (e1), Knight (e4), Rook (e7), Pawn (a7), Pawn (g4)\n\n- **Threats:**  \n  - White has a dangerous passed pawn on a7, one step from promotion.\n  - White's rook on e7 is active, and the knight on e4 is centralized.\n  - Black's rook on b2 is active, and the knight on g1 is oddly placed but could be useful.\n  - Black's pawn on e2 is one step from promotion, but White's king is on e1, blocking it.\n\n- **Immediate Tactics:**  \n  - Black's king is on e5, and can move to d5, f4, or d4.\n  - White's rook on e7 is threatening to support a pawn promotion or attack Black's pawns.\n  - Black's knight on g1 is attacking e2, but White's king is blocking the pawn.\n\nLet's analyze each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **e5d5 (King to d5)**\n- King moves away from the center, closer to the queenside.\n- This could help support the rook and try to stop the a7 pawn.\n- However, after this move, White can play a8=Q (promote), and Black cannot stop it.\n- Black can try to counterattack with Rb1+ and then Nf3+ ideas, but White's king is relatively safe.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **e5f4 (King to f4)**\n- King moves toward the kingside, possibly to support the g6 pawn or threaten White's g4 pawn.\n- However, this does not address the immediate threat of a8=Q.\n- After a8=Q, Black can try to create threats, but White will have a decisive material advantage.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **e5d4 (King to d4)**\n- King moves aggressively toward the queenside, possibly to help stop the a7 pawn.\n- After a8=Q, Black can play Rb1+ and try to create counterplay.\n- However, White's new queen will be too strong.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Point**\nIn all three moves, White can promote a7 to a queen on the next move. Black's only hope is to create immediate threats or try to force perpetual check or stalemate.\n\nBut let's look for any tactical tricks:\n\n- After e5d4, if White plays a8=Q, Black can play Rb1+.\n- If White's king moves to f2, Black can try Nh3+ and try to create threats, but White's king is relatively safe.\n\nIs there any way to stop the a7 pawn from promoting?  \nNo, since the king cannot reach a8 in time, and the rook is too far.\n\nIs there any way to create a perpetual check or force a draw?  \nNot immediately, but the most active move is to move the king toward the queenside to try to support the rook and knight in creating threats.\n\n### **Best Move**\nAmong the three, **e5d4** is the most active. It brings the king closer to the queenside, where the action is, and may give Black the best chance to create counterplay or try for a perpetual check.\n\n### **Final Move**\n```\ne5d4\n```"
