When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qg5: Attacks the bishop on d5 and threatens Qxd8. If Black plays Qg6, then Qxg6+ fxg6 and e6 wins a piece.\n2. Qe7: Attacks g7 and d8, but Black can defend with Qg6.\n3. e6: Attacks the bishop and threatens e7, but Black can play fxe6.\n4. f5: Attacks the bishop, but doesn't seem to create a direct threat.\n\nLet's calculate Qg5:\n- 41. Qg5 Qg6 (forced, otherwise Qxd8 wins)\n- 42. Qxg6+ fxg6\n- 43. e6! Bxe6 (if fxe6, then Rxe6 wins a piece)\n- 44. Rxe6 and White is up a piece.\n\nAlternatively, after Qg5, if Black plays Rd7, then Qf5+ g6 Qxd7 wins.\n\nTherefore, Qg5 is a strong move, threatening Qxd8 and putting pressure on Black.\n\nMy move:\n```\nh4g5\n```"
