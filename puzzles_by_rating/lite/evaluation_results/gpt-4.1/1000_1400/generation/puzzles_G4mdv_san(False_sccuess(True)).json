No checks are available.\n\nIs there any way to block the h6-bishop or the queen? No.\n\nIs there any way to create luft for the king? Moving the b6-pawn or a6-pawn does not help.\n\nIs there any way to sacrifice material to delay mate? Let's try **f6g6**:\n\n- 1... Qg6 2. Qxg7+ Qxg7 3. Bxg7, White is up a rook and a queen for two rooks, with a completely winning position.\n\nAlternatively, **f6f8**:\n\n- 1... Qf8 2. Qxg7+ Rf7 3. Bxf7 Qxf7 4. Rd7+ Kxd7 5. Qxf7+ Kd6 6. Qxb7, again, White is completely winning.\n\nAlternatively, **f6f7**:\n\n- 1... Qf7 2. Qxg7, mate.\n\nAlternatively, **c7c8**:\n\n- 1... Rc8 2. Qxg7+, mate.\n\nAlternatively, **h6h5**:\n\n- 1... h5 2. Qxg7+, mate.\n\nThere is no way to prevent mate on g7. The only move that delays mate by one move is **f6g6**.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf6g6\n```"
