If gxh3, then Nxf4 and Black wins a queen for a knight and pawn, which is a huge material gain.\n- If White plays Kg1 after Qxh3+, then Black can continue with Qe3+ and keep checking.\n\n**Calculation of Qxh3+:**\n1. ... Qxh3+  \n   2. gxh3 (forced, otherwise White loses a pawn and gets checked again)\n   2. ... Nxf4 (attacks queen and wins the queen for a knight and pawn)\n\nThis is a decisive material gain for Black.\n\n**Double-checking for any White counterplay:**\n- After Qxh3+ gxh3 Nxf4, White's queen is attacked and cannot escape, as all squares are covered or blocked.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is the immediate check and capture:\n\n```\nQxh3+\n```"
