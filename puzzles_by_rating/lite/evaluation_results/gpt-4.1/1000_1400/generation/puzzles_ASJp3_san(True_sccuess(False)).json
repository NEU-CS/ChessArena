If ...Kxg7, then Rxf7+ wins the queen on d3.\n- If ...Kh8 after Qxg7+, then Qxf8+ wins the rook.\n\nLet's check the line:\n\n1. Qxg7+ Kxg7\n2. Rxf7+ Rxf7 (forced)\n3. Qg6+! (skewer, attacking the rook on f7 and the queen on d3)\n   - If ...Kf8, Qxd3 wins the queen.\n   - If ...Kf6, Qxd3 wins the queen.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Qxg7+ Kh8, 2. Qxf8+ wins the rook.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- 1. Qxg7+ Kxg7 2. Rxf7+ Rxf7 3. Qg6+ Kf8 4. Qxd3, White is up a rook for a pawn, completely winning.\n- 1. Qxg7+ Kh8 2. Qxf8+ Rxf8 3. Rxf7, White is up a rook, completely winning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move Qxg7+ is crushing and wins material decisively.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nQxg7+\n```"
