If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If White moves the queen, Black can consider Re1+ or other active moves.\n- **Qxh3**: After Qxh3, White can play Qxh3 Bxh3 Bxh3, but then Black's bishop is active and White's attack is less dangerous.\n- **Re2**: If Re2, White can play Rxe2 Rxe2 Qf3, defending everything.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **Qh4** seems the most logical, as it forces a queen trade or a retreat, relieving pressure and possibly allowing Black to seize the initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQh4\n```"
