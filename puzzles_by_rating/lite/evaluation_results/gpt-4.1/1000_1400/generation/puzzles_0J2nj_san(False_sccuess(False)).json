When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's queenside pawns are advanced but not immediately dangerous.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- f5f6: Advances the king, but f6 is not accessible (blocked by own pawn).\n- f5g5: King moves toward kingside, but not clear if it's best.\n- f5f4: Retreats the king, not ideal.\n- g4g5: Advances kingside pawn majority, threatens to create a passed pawn.\n- h3h4: Prepares g5, but less direct.\n- f2f3: Supports g4, but not urgent.\n- a2a3/a2a4: Slows Black's queenside pawns, but not urgent.\n- f2f4: Opens up kingside, but may weaken e3 square.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n- g4g5 is the most aggressive move, immediately challenging Black's kingside and threatening to create a passed pawn. If Black responds with ...a5-a4, White can still push g5-g6, and the king is well-placed to support the advance. Black's king is far from the kingside and cannot stop the pawns easily.\n\n**Tactical check:**\n- After g4g5, Black cannot stop White from pushing g6, and White's king can support the pawns. Black's queenside pawns are not fast enough to promote before White does.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to push the g-pawn and create a passed pawn.\n\n```\ng4g5\n```"
