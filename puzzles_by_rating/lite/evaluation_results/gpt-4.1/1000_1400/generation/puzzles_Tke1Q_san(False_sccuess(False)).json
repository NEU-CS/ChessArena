When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxg6: Captures a pawn, but after ...Qxg6, White loses the queen for a pawn.\n2. Qe6+: Checks the king, but Black can block with Rf7 or Kh8.\n3. Bg5: Attacks the queen, but Black can play Qd6.\n4. Nb5: Attacks the queen and threatens Nc7, but after ...Qe7, the threat is parried.\n5. Rf1: Brings another piece into the attack.\n6. d6: Opens the c-file and threatens dxc7.\n\nLet's look at Qe6+:\n- 22. Qe6+ Qxe6 23. dxe6, White has a dangerous passed pawn on e6, and the bishop on g7 is pinned to the king. This looks promising.\n\nWhat about Bg5?\n- 22. Bg5 Qf7 (or Qd6), and Black is still defending.\n\nWhat about d6?\n- 22. d6 cxd6 23. Qxd7, but then Black can play Bh6, defending.\n\nWhat about Rf1?\n- 22. Rf1 Qd6, and Black is still defending.\n\nQe6+ seems the most forcing.\n\nLet's check the line:\n22. Qe6+ Qxe6 23. dxe6, now the threat is e7 and e8=Q, and the bishop on g7 is pinned. Black's rook cannot move, and the bishop cannot move. The only defense is Rc8, but then e7 wins.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng4e6\n```"
