When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qe1+ (forces Rf1, then what?)\n2. Qe4 (centralizes, threatens Qxg2# if bishop moves, attacks bishop)\n3. Qxf2 (not possible)\n4. Rc1+ (not possible)\n5. h3 (pushes pawn, but White can play Qg5+)\n6. h5 (solidifies pawn, but not urgent)\n7. Qe3 (attacks rook, but White can defend)\n8. Qd1+ (forces Bf1, then what?)\n\n**Deep calculation for Qe4:**\n- 28...Qe4\n  - If Qxe4, Bxe4, Black is up a piece.\n  - If Bxe4, Qxg2+ mates.\n  - If Qg4+, Qg6, or Qg5+, Black can respond with Qg6 or Qg4, trading queens and winning.\n\n**Checking for tactics:**\n- 28...Qe4 threatens mate on g2 and attacks the bishop. If White plays Qg4+ or Qg5+, Black can block with Qg6, trading queens, and Black is winning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is:\n```\ne2e4\n```"
