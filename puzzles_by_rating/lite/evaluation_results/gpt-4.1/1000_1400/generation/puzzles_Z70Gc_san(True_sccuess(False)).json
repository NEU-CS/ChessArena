After Kxe1, Black can play hxg4, but White's king escapes to f2.\n3. **Qd6**: Retreats the queen, but loses momentum.\n4. **hxg4**: Opens the h-file, but doesn't threaten immediate tactics.\n5. **Bxc2+**: This is a check. If White plays Kxc2, then Qxg1 wins a piece, but White's king escapes to c3.\n6. **Qxh4**: Captures a pawn, but not forcing.\n7. **Bxd4**: Not legal.\n8. **Qxf3**: Captures the queen, but the queen is not on f3.\n\n**Critical line:**\n- **Qe1+** is the most forcing move. Let's see what happens:\n    - 1... Qe1+ 2. Qxe1 (forced, otherwise White loses the queen) hxg4 (threatening gxf3 and opening the h-file)\n    - But after 2. Qxe1, Black can play hxg4, but White is up a piece and can defend.\n- **Bxc2+** is a check, let's see:\n    - 1... Bxc2+ 2. Kxc2 Qxg1 (winning a piece, but White's king escapes to c3)\n    - After 3. Nc3, Black has no immediate follow-up.\n\n**Is there a mate?**\n- **Qe1+** is the most forcing, but after Qxe1, Black has no immediate mate.\n- **Qxg4**: Captures a pawn, but not forcing.\n- **Qxh4**: Captures a pawn, but not forcing.\n\n**Is there a way to increase pressure?**\n- **hxg4**: Opens the h-file, but White can respond with fxg4.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Qe1+** is the most forcing move, as it forces White to exchange queens or lose the queen, and Black can try to attack the exposed king.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQe1+\n```"
