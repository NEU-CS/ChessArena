If Black captures with Kxc7, then b6+ wins the king for White.\n6. **a7:** Pushes the a-pawn, but c7 is more forcing.\n\nLet's look at **c7** in detail:\n- If **c7**, Black must play Kxc7 (otherwise c8=Q).\n- Then **b6+** is check, and the Black king must move.\n- After the king moves, **a7-a8=Q** is coming, but let's check if Black can promote their pawns faster.\n\nAlternatively, after **Kxe5**, White removes the e5 pawn, but Black's kingside pawns are still dangerous and White's queenside pawns are not immediately queening.\n\n**c7** is the most forcing move and seems to win immediately.\n\nLet's check the line:\n1. c7 Kxc7\n2. b6+ Kxb6 (forced)\n3. Kxe5 (now White has time to mop up the kingside pawns, and Black's pawns are too slow)\n\nAlternatively, after 1. c7, if Black ignores and pushes f3, then c8=Q and White wins.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc7\n```"
