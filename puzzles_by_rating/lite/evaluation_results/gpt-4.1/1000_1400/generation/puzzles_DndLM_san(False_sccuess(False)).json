When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is in a dangerous spot, and the only thing stopping immediate mate is the rook on f7.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- g7g8: King to g8, but White can play Re8#.\n- f7f8: Rook to f8, but White can play Rxg6+ followed by mate.\n- d4d8: Rook to d8, covering the back rank, but White can play Rxg6+ and after Kf8, Rh8#.\n- d4d7: Rook to d7, but White can play Re8#.\n- f7f6: Rook to f6, but White can play gxf6+ and then mate.\n- f7f5: Rook to f5, but White can play Re8#.\n- f7f4: Rook to f4, but White can play Re8#.\n- d4d6: Rook to d6, but White can play Re8#.\n- d4f4: Rook to f4, but White can play Re8#.\n- d4e4: Rook to e4, but White can play Re8#.\n- d4c4: Rook to c4, but White can play Re8#.\n- d4b4: Rook to b4, but White can play Re8#.\n- d4a4: Rook to a4, but White can play Re8#.\n- d4d3: Rook to d3, but White can play Re8#.\n- d4d2: Rook to d2, but White can play Re8#.\n- d4d1: Rook to d1+, but White can play Ka2 and still threaten mate.\n- a7a6: Pawn move, doesn't help.\n- b5b4: Pawn move, doesn't help.\n- a7a5: Pawn move, doesn't help.\n\nThe only move that prevents immediate mate is:\n- d4d1+ (check).
