White's attack is neutralized, and Black keeps material advantage.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nQxh5\n```"

Let's analyze the options:\n\n1. **Kh8:** King moves to h8. \n   - After Qxe5, White threatens mate on g7 and f6 is pinned. This looks dangerous.\n\n2. **Kf8:** King moves to f8.\n   - After Qxe5, White threatens Qxf6+ and Rg8# ideas. Also dangerous.\n\n3. **Kh7:** King moves to h7.\n   - After Qxe5, White threatens Qxf6 and Rg7+ ideas. Still dangerous.\n\n4. **Kf7:** King moves to f7.\n   - After Qxe5, White threatens Qxf6+ and Rg7+. Still dangerous.\n\n5. **Rg6:** Block with rook.\n   - White can play Rxg6+, hxg6, Qxe5, and Black's king is exposed.\n\n6. **Qg6:** Block with queen.\n   - White can play Rxg6+, Qxg6, Qxe5, and Black's king is exposed.\n\n7. **Qxg5:** Capture the rook with the queen.\n   - After Qxg5, Qxg5+ Kf7 (forced), Qxe5, White is up material and has a strong attack.\n\n**Deeper look:**\n\nLet's look at the most forcing move: **Qxg5**.\n\n- 1... Qxg5 2. Qxg5+ Kf7 (forced, as Kg7 runs into Qxe5+ and mate threats)\n- 3. Qxe5\n\nNow, White is up a rook and a pawn for a queen, but Black's king is exposed and White's pieces are active.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at **Kh8**:\n\n- 1... Kh8 2. Qxe5 (threatening Qxf6 and mate)\n- If Rf1+ 3. Rxf1 Qxf1+ 4. Kxf1 and Black is lost.\n\n**Blocking with rook or queen:**\n\n- 1... Rg6 2. Rxg6+ Rxg6 3. Qxe5 and Black is down material and under attack.\n\n**Best chance:**\n\nAll options are bad, but **Qxg5** at least trades queens and reduces the attacking potential, giving Black some hope to hold in a materially worse but less dangerous position.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\nQxg5\n```"
