If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Legal moves:** Kh6, Kh4\n\nLet's visualize the board:\n\n- Black king is on h5.\n- White has a queen on f5, a bishop on d6, a pawn on g6, a pawn on b5, a pawn on e4, a pawn on f3, a pawn on g2, a pawn on a4, and a king on a4.\n- Black has a queen on d2, a bishop on b6, a pawn on f4, a pawn on e5, a pawn on b8, and a king on h5.\n\n**Legal moves:** Kh6, Kh4\n\nLet's analyze both:\n\n1. **Kh6:** King moves to h6.\n   - Is this safe? White can play Qg5# (checkmate), because the king on h6 is trapped by its own pawn on g7 and the pawn on g6. So Kh6 loses immediately to Qg5#.\n\n2. **Kh4:** King moves to h4.\n   - Is this safe? Let's see if White has any immediate mate:\n     - Qg4# is not possible (the queen is on f5).\n     - Qg5+ is possible, but then Kh3 is not possible (blocked by pawn on g2), so the king is on h4.\n     - After Qg4+, Kh3 is not possible, but after Qg4+, Qxg4 is possible, but the queen is on f5, so Qg4+ is not possible.\n     - Is there any immediate mate? Let's check:\n       - Qg4+ is not possible.\n       - Qh3+ is not possible.\n       - Qg5+ is possible, but after Kh4, Qg5+ is not mate, but the king is still exposed.\n\nBut between the two, **Kh6 is immediate mate, so Kh4 is forced**.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nKh4\n```"
