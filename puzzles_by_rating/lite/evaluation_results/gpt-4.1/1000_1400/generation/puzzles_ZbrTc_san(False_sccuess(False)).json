When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White exchanges on d5, Black can recapture with the knight, maintaining a strong central presence. If White ignores, Black threatens to take on f3 or support e7 with the bishop.\n\nLet's check the consequences:\n- 23...Bd5 24. Qxe7 (threatening Qxd6) Nf5 (attacking queen and bishop) 25. Qe2 Re8, Black is active.\n- 23...Bd5 24. Qxe7 Nf5 25. Qe2 Bf6, Black is fine.\n- 23...Bd5 24. Bxd6 Bxd6 25. Qd3, White is not threatening much.\n\n**Conclusion:** 23...Bd5 is the best move, challenging White's center and activating the bishop.\n\nMy move:\n```\nb7d5\n```"
