If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If Kg8, then White can consider f5 or h5, pushing pawns with tempo.\n2. **Rxg6+**: Captures a pawn with check. If Kxg6, then h5 is strong, creating a passed pawn.\n3. **h5**: Immediate push, but Black can respond with gxh5+ and after Kxh5, Black's rook becomes active.\n4. **f5**: Pawn push, but not as forcing as the checks.\n5. **Rxa6**: Captures a pawn, but loses tempo and allows Black counterplay.\n\n**Let's calculate Rxg6+ in detail:**\n- 1. Rxg6+ Kxg6 (forced)\n- 2. h5+ Kf7 (if Kf7, then f5, White's pawns are rolling)\n- 2...Kg7 (if Kg7, then Kf5, White's king is very active)\n\n**Let's calculate Rd7+:**\n- 1. Rd7+ Kf8 (if Kf8, then f5, White's pawns are rolling)\n- 1...Kg8 (if Kg8, then f5 or h5, again White's pawns are rolling)\n\n**Which is better: Rxg6+ or Rd7+?**\n- Rxg6+ wins a pawn immediately and forces the king to g6, where it is more exposed.\n- After Rxg6+ Kxg6, h5+ is strong, and White's king can become very active.\n\n**Let's check for any Black counterplay after Rxg6+ Kxg6 h5+ Kf7 (or Kg7):**\n- White can play Kf5, threatening g5 and f5.\n- Black's rook is still on e6, but White's king and pawns are very active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRxg6+ is the most forcing move, wins a pawn, and keeps the initiative.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRxg6+\n```"
