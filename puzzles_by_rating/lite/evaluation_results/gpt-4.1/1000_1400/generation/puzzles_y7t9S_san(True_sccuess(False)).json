If Black plays Kf8, then Nf5 can return, or White can continue the attack.\n2. **Nxe7**: Knight captures bishop on e7, attacking the queen and king.\n3. **Nxd6+**: Knight captures on d6 with check, forking king and queen.\n4. **Bxb5+**: Bishop captures on b5 with check.\n5. **Qxe3**: Queen captures knight on e3, but this loses the knight on f5.\n6. **Other knight moves**: Less forcing.\n\nLet's calculate the most forcing moves:\n\n**1. Nxg7+**\n- If Kf8, then Nf5 returns, but Black can try Bg5 pinning the knight.\n- If Kd8, then Nf5, but Black is still under pressure.\n\n**2. Nxe7**\n- Knight captures bishop, attacking queen and king. If Qxe7, then Bxb5+ is possible.\n\n**3. Nxd6+**\n- Knight captures pawn with check. If Bxd6, then Bxb5+ is possible, but Black can recapture with the queen as well.\n\n**4. Bxb5+**\n- Bishop captures pawn with check. If axb5, then Nxb5, but Black can defend.\n\n**5. Nxh6**\n- Knight captures pawn, but less forcing.\n\n**6. Nxe3**\n- Knight captures knight, but this loses the knight on f5.\n\n**Best move: Nxd6+**\n- This is a check, and if Black plays Bxd6, then Bxb5+ is very strong, opening the a-file and exposing Black's king. If Qxd6, then Bxb5+ is still strong. If Kf8, then Nxb7 wins the queen.\n\nLet's check the calculation:\n- 1. Nxd6+ Bxd6 (or Qxd6)\n- 2. Bxb5+ axb5\n- 3. Nxb5, White is up material and Black's king is exposed.\n\nAlternatively, after Nxd6+:\n- If Kf8, then Nxb7 wins the queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nNxd6+\n```"
