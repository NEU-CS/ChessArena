When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Legal moves: Kg3, Kg1\n\nLet's reconstruct the board:\n\n- White king: f2\n- Black king: h8\n- White queen: a7\n- Black rook: f8\n- White rook: d3, e1\n- Black bishop: d8\n- White bishop: c1\n- Black queen: e4\n- White knight: d5\n- Black knight: g4\n- White pawns: b2, g2, h3\n- Black pawns: a5, b6, g7, h7\n\nBlack is threatening mate with ...Qxe1+ or ...Qf3+. The only legal moves for White are Kg3 and Kg1.\n\nLet's analyze both:\n\n1. **Kg3**: \n   - After Kg3, Black can play Qxe1+, and after Kxg4, h5+ is mate.\n   - Or, after Kg3, Black can play Qf4+ and White is mated soon.\n\n2. **Kg1**:\n   - After Kg1, Black can play Qxe1+ and after Kh2, Qg3+ is mate.\n\nBut let's check for any possible stalemate or perpetual.\n\nGiven the legal moves, both seem to lose immediately, but let's check for any nuance.\n\n- **Kg3 Qxe1+** (forced), Kg4 (only move), h5+ (forced), Kxh5, g6+ (forced), Kxg6, Qe8+ (forced), Kf5, Qe6#.\n\n- **Kg1 Qxe1+** (forced), Kh2 (only move), Qg3+ (forced), Kh1, Qh2#.\n\nBoth moves lose immediately, but let's check if there's any resource.\n\nGiven that, both moves lose, but perhaps one prolongs the game. Let's check the move order for Kg3:\n\n1. Kg3 Qxe1+ (forced)\n2. Kxg4 (only move)\n3. h5+ (forced)\n4. Kxh5 (only move)\n5. g6+ (forced)\n6. Kxg6 (only move)\n7. Qe8+ (forced)\n8. Kf5 (only move)\n9. Qe6# (mate)\n\nSo, mate in 9.\n\nFor Kg1:\n\n1. Kg1 Qxe1+ (forced)\n2. Kh2 (only move)\n3. Qg3+ (forced)\n4. Kh1 (only move)\n5. Qh2# (mate)\n\nMate in 5.\n\nTherefore, **Kg3** delays mate longer than Kg1.\n\nThus, the best move is:\n```\nKg3\n```"
