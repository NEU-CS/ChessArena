When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Nc3-d5**\n- If Black plays Bxd5, then Nxd5, and White has a strong knight on d5.\n- If Black plays Qd8, then White can continue development.\n- If Black plays Qf5, White can play Nxc7+.\n\n**2. f4-f5**\n- If Qxf5, then Qxf5 Bxf5, White loses the queen for two pieces.\n- If Bxf5, then Qxc5, White wins a bishop.\n- If Qe5+, White can block with Be2.\n- If Qh4+, White can play g3.\n\n**3. c1e3**\n- Develops, but not forcing.\n\n**4. f2h4**\n- Queen to h4, aiming at kingside, but not forcing.\n\n**5. f2d4**\n- Queen to d4, attacking g7 and threatening Qxg7, but Black can play Nxc2+.\n\nBetween Nc3-d5 and f4-f5, let's look at f4-f5 in detail:\n\n- f4-f5 attacks both the queen and bishop.\n- If Qxf5, Qxf5 Bxf5, White loses the queen for two pieces.\n- If Bxf5, Qxc5, White wins a piece.\n- If Qe5+, Be2, queen must move again.\n- If Qh4+, g3, queen must move.\n\nBut after f4-f5, Black's best may be Qxf5, but then Qxf5 Bxf5, White is down material.\n\nNow, Nc3-d5:\n\n- Nc3-d5 attacks the bishop on e6 and knight on d4.\n- If Bxd5, Nxd5, White has a strong knight.\n- If Qd8, White can play c3.\n- If Qf5, Nxc7+.\n\nNc3-d5 looks strong, as it attacks multiple pieces and threatens Nxc7+.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc3d5\n```"
