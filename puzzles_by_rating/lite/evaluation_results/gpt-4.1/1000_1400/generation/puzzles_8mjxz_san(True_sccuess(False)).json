If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If I play Qxg7, White's c6 pawn is very dangerous.\n- If I play Bxh3, White's threats remain.\n- If I play Qf4+, White's king moves, but I don't gain anything.\n\n**What about Nc4?**\n- Nc4 attacks the queen on c2 and the bishop on b4. If White captures the rook on e8, I can recapture with the bishop and defend c7.\n\n**Let's calculate Nc4:**\n- 1... Nc4 2. Nxe8 Rxe8 (or Bxe8) 3. Bxc4 Bxc4\n- Now, the c6 pawn is still dangerous, but I've exchanged some pieces and reduced White's attacking potential.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n- Qxg7 is tempting, but after cxb7, White is too fast.\n- Nc4 seems to be the best defensive resource, attacking the queen and bishop and forcing White to react.\n\n**Final decision:**\n```\nNc4\n```"
