If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Not ideal.\n2. **h4**: Expands on the kingside, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.\n3. **f4**: Expands in the center, possibly preparing to play e5 at a better moment, and also restricts Black's king.\n4. **c4**: Expands on the queenside, but could open lines for Black's king to invade.\n5. **Kd3**: Centralizes the king, but doesn't change the pawn structure.\n6. **g4**: Expands on the kingside, but could create weaknesses.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n- **f4** is interesting because it supports e5 in the future and restricts Black's king from coming to g5 or e5.\n- **e5+** is premature, as it just activates Black's king.\n- **c4** could open the queenside, but White's king is not ready to support a queenside breakthrough.\n- **h4** is slow and doesn't change much.\n- **Kd3** is solid, but doesn't press for advantage.\n\n**Best plan:**  \nWhite should try to restrict Black's king and prepare to advance on the kingside or in the center. The move **f4** achieves this by controlling key squares and keeping options open.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf4\n```"
