Rxh3+ gxh3 Qg1+ \n   - White's only move is Qxg1 (forced), then Black recaptures Qxg1+.\n   - White's king is now on h1, and Black has won a queen for a rook and pawn (material advantage).\n\nBut let's check if White has any defense after Rxh3+ gxh3 Qg1+.\n\n- 1... Rxh3+ 2. gxh3 Qg1+ 3. Qxg1 Qxg1+ 4. Kxg1\n  - Now, Black is up a rook and two pawns for a queen, but White has a dangerous passed pawn on a6 and a rook on a4.\n  - Black's king is relatively safe, and Black can try to coordinate the rook and queen to stop the a-pawn and go for mate.\n\nAlternatively, after Rxh3+ gxh3, if Black doesn't play Qg1+, White's king is still exposed.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n- Qg1+ immediately doesn't work because White can just take with the queen.\n- Rxh3+ is the most forcing move and wins material.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is the forcing check:\n\n```\nRxh3+\n```"
