When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong bishop on d7 and active rooks.\n- Black's king is exposed, but White's king is also not perfectly safe.\n- Black's bishop on g4 is active, and the pawn on f5 is under attack.\n- White threatens to double rooks on the seventh rank or invade via d6/d8.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **f5g6**: Pawn captures on g6. This opens the f-file, but White can recapture with the h-pawn, opening the h-file for White's rook. This may expose Black's king further.\n2. **f5f4**: Pawn advances to f4, attacking White's king and bishop. This could create threats, but White can play Bxg4 or Rd6+.\n3. **f5e4**: Pawn captures on e4, attacking the rook on d2 and bishop on d7. This is a forcing move and may win material if White is not careful.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n\n- **f5e4**: If Black plays f5e4, White must respond. If White plays Bxf5, then Kxf5, and Black is up a piece. If White plays Re2, then Black is up a pawn and has a strong passed pawn on e4. This move attacks the rook and bishop simultaneously.\n\n- **f5g6**: After hxg6, White's rook can swing to h7 with check, and Black's king is exposed.\n\n- **f5f4**: White can play Bxg4, hxg4, and then Rd6+ with a strong attack.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **f5e4** is the strongest, as it attacks two pieces and may win material.\n\nMy move:\n```\nf5e4\n```"
