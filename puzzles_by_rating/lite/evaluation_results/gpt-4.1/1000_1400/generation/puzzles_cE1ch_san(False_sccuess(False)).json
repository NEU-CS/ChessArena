When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:** h5h6, h5h4\n\n**Material:**\n- Black: King (h5), Rook (b8), Bishop (b6), Pawn (f4), Queen (d2)\n- White: King (a4), Queen (f5), Bishop (d6), Bishop (c6), Pawn (b5), Pawn (e4), Pawn (f3), Pawn (g6), Pawn (g7)\n\n**Position:**\n- Black's king is on h5, exposed but not immediately in danger.\n- White's king is on a4, also exposed.\n- Black's queen is active on d2.\n- Black's rook is on b8, potentially useful on the b-file.\n- Black's bishop is on b6, controlling the long diagonal.\n- Black's pawn on f4 is restricting White's king and pawns.\n- White has two strong bishops and a dangerous g7 pawn.\n\n**Threats:**\n- White is threatening g7-g8=Q, but Black's queen on d2 covers g5 and d6.\n- White's queen and bishops are very active and coordinate well.\n- Black's king is exposed, but White has no immediate check.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n- h5h6: King to h6\n- h5h4: King to h4\n\nLet's evaluate both:\n\n1. **h5h6:** King to h6\n   - The king moves away from the edge, but is still exposed.\n   - White may try Qg6+ or Qh7+ ideas, but currently, there is no immediate check.\n   - White could try g7-g8=Q, but after Rxg8, White's queen is gone.\n   - White could try Qf6, threatening Qh4# if the king moves to h4.\n\n2. **h5h4:** King to h4\n   - The king moves closer to the center, but is still exposed.\n   - White could try Qg4# if the king is on h4, but currently, the queen is on f5.\n   - White could try Qh7+ or Qg6+ ideas, but currently, there is no immediate check.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- Both moves do not immediately lose, but the king is exposed in both cases.\n- The king on h4 could be more vulnerable to checks along the fourth rank.\n- The king on h6 is slightly safer, as it is not on the edge and not on a light square (so White's bishops can't check it immediately).\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Black needs to avoid perpetual check and try to use the material advantage (queen, rook, bishop vs. two bishops and a queen).\n- Black's queen and rook are well placed to support defense and counterattack.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- h5h6 is slightly safer, as the king is less exposed to checks and not on the edge.\n- h5h4 could allow White to check with Qg4+ if the queen moves.\n\n**Best move:**\n```\nh5h6\n```"
