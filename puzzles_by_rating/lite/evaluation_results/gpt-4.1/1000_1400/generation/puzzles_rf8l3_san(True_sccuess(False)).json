When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If ...Qxf6, then White can play Rhg1, threatening mate on g8.\n2. **Bxe3**: Captures the dangerous pawn, but loses tempo and doesn't create immediate threats.\n3. **Bb8**: Attacks the rook on h8, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n4. **Rhg1**: Prepares to double rooks on the g-file, but not immediately threatening.\n5. **h4**: Slow, not urgent.\n6. **Nd6**: Attacks the queen, but after ...Qe7, nothing immediate.\n\n**Calculation of Nxf6+:**\n- 1. Nxf6+ Qxf6 (if ...gxf6, then White can play Rhg1+ and after ...Kf7, Rae1, White is winning)\n- 2. Rhg1 threatening Qxg7#\n- Black must play ...Kf8 or ...Kf7, but after Rae1, White is dominating.\n\n**Calculation of Bxe3:**\n- 1. Bxe3, Qc7+ (potential check), but White can block with Kg2 or Kh1.\n\n**Calculation of Bb8:**\n- 1. Bb8, Rxb8, 2. Qxb8+ Qf8, 3. Qxf8+ Kxf8, White is up a piece, but Black has two pawns for it.\n\n**Best Move:**\nNxf6+ is the most forcing and creates immediate threats.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nNxf6+\n```"
