If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

After Qxb7, Black could play Qa5+ or Ne7, but Qa5+ is not possible because the queen is on d8. Ne7 attacks the queen, but White can retreat. This wins a pawn and threatens Bxc6+.\n3. **Bxc6+**: Immediate check, but after bxc6, White's queen can take c6, but then Black can play Qd7, defending.\n4. **c5**: Undermines the d4 pawn, but Black can play Qa5+.\n5. **Bh6**: Attacks the rook on g7, but Black can play Nxh6.\n6. **Bg5**: Pins the knight, but the knight is not currently a threat.\n\n**Deep calculation for Qxb7:**\n- Qxb7 Rxb7 Bxc6+ Rd7 Bxd7+ Qxd7 Qxd7+ Kxd7\n- White is up a pawn and has a better position.\n\n**Deep calculation for O-O:**\n- Safe, but does not press the advantage.\n\n**Deep calculation for Bxc6+:**\n- Bxc6+ bxc6 Qxb8 Qxb8 Bxe5 Qxe5\n- Material is even, but White's king is still in the center.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Qxb7 is the most aggressive and wins a pawn, threatening Bxc6+ next.\n- O-O is safe, but less ambitious.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nQxb7\n```"
