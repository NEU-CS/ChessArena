If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

White's king is far away.\n2. **King moves**: Ke6, Kd6, Kc6, Ke5, Kc5, Kd4, Kc4. These are mostly centralizing or moving toward the queenside.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- If I play **h2**, White cannot stop the pawn from queening. If 44. Kg2, then 44...h1=Q+ and Black wins.\n- If White tries to push the a-pawn, Black can ignore it and queen first.\n- The White king is too far to help on the h-file.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to push the h-pawn.\n\n```\nh2\n```"
