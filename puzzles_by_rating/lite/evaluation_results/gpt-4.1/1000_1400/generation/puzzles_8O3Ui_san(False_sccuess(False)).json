When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If bxc6, Black's pawn structure is damaged.\n2. **f4c7**: Bishop takes on c7, attacking the queen and threatening a fork on b8.\n3. **e1g1**: Castling kingside, bringing the rook into play and safeguarding the king.\n4. **f3g4**: Queen captures knight on g4, but after Qxg4, Black can recapture with the queen.\n5. **e3e4**: Opens the center, but Black's queen and knight are well placed.\n\n**Deep analysis:**\n- **b5c6** is the most forcing move. After bxc6, White can play hxg4, winning a piece, since the knight on g4 is now unsupported. If Qxc6, White can play hxg4, again winning a piece.\n- **f4c7** is interesting, but after Qxc7, White doesn't gain material.\n- **e1g1** is safe, but not pressing the advantage.\n- **f3g4** is possible, but after Qxg4, Black can recapture.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. b5c6 bxc6 (or Qxc6)\n2. hxg4\n\nWhite wins a piece.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb5c6\n```"
