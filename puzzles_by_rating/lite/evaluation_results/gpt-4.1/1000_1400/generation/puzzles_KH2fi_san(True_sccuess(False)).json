When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's knight on f2 is attacking g4 and h3, but White's knight on g3 covers h1 and f1. Black's knight on d3 is centralized and supports b2 and e5, but not directly threatening anything immediate.\n\nTactical ideas:\n- Rxh6+ is a forcing move, giving check and picking up a pawn.\n- Rd8 is a rook invasion, but Black can defend with Rxd8.\n- Nf5 attacks g7 and covers h6, but Black's rook on e8 is well placed.\n- Bg8 is a check, but Black can block with Rxg8.\n- h4 is a quiet move, but doesn't threaten much.\n\nLet's calculate Rxh6+:\n\n1. Rxh6+ gxh6 (forced)\n2. Nf5+ (forking king and rook, but the king can move to h7)\n   - If ...Kh7, then Kxf2, but White has won a pawn and opened up the king.\n\nAlternatively, after Rxh6+ gxh6, White can try Nf5, threatening mate on h6, but Black can defend with Re1+ and after Kh2, Ng4+.\n\nIs there a better move?\n\nWhat about Rd8?  \n1. Rd8 Rxd8  \n2. Bxd3 Nxd3  \n3. Nf5 (attacking g7 and h6, but Black is up a piece)\n\nWhat about Nf5 immediately?  \n1. Nf5 Re1+  \n2. Kh2 Rh1+  \n3. Kxh1 Nf2+  \n4. Kg1 Nxh3+  \n5. gxh3 (White is up a piece, but Black has a dangerous passed pawn)\n\nBut after Nf5, Black can play Re1+ and after Kh2, Ng4+.\n\nWhat about Rxh6+? Let's calculate deeper:\n\n1. Rxh6+ gxh6\n2. Nf5+ Kh7 (forced)\n3. Kxf2 (White wins a pawn, and Black's king is exposed)\n\nAlternatively, after Rxh6+ gxh6, White can play Nf5, and if ...Kh7, then Kxf2.\n\nThis seems to be the best way to press the advantage and open up Black's king.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxh6+\n```"
