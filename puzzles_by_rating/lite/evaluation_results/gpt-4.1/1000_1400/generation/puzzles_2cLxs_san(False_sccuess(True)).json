It also keeps the queen and bishop coordinated for defense. After Kh2, White can consider capturing on g3 next move or pushing f4.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng1h2\n```"

Legal move:** h2g1\n\n**Position breakdown:**\n- Black's last move was ...g5h4, so the Black queen is on h4 and threatens mate on h1 (Qh1#).\n- White's king is on h2, and the only legal move is to g1.\n- White's queen is on f2, bishop on d3, rook on a1, pawns on a5, c2, d4, and h2.\n- Black has a dangerous knight on g3, queen on h4, and is threatening mate.\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- Black threatens Qh1#, which is mate.\n- White's only legal move is to move the king from h2 to g1.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- There are no other legal moves for White; the only move is h2g1.\n- After h2g1, Black will likely continue the attack, but for now, White avoids immediate mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only legal move is to move the king to g1.\n\n```\nh2g1\n```"
