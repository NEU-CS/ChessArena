When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

But White can defend.\n2. **e5e6**: Pushes the pawn, attacking the queen and opening lines, but Black can play Qxe6.\n3. **d3d4**: Queen centralizes, but doesn't threaten much.\n4. **f1f5**: Rook takes on f5, but Black can recapture with queen or pawn.\n5. **d3a6**: Queen attacks a6 pawn, but not very threatening.\n6. **h3h4**: Gives luft for the king, but slow.\n\n**Critical Calculation:**\n- **d3f5** (Qxf5) is the most forcing. Let's check:\n    1. Qxf5 Qxf5 Rxf5 d3 (threatening d2 and mate on g2)\n    2. White can play Rcf1, defending f2 and g2.\n    3. If Black plays d2, White has Rd1, and the pawn is blockaded.\n\nAlternatively, after Qxf5, if Black plays Qg3+ (check), White can play Kh1, and Black has no immediate mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Qxf5 wins a full rook and is safe after calculation.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nd3f5\n```"
