If the knight moves, White can consider pushing the d-pawn.\n\nKing moves:\n- Kc6: centralizes the king, but doesn't threaten anything immediately.\n- Kb6: not threatening.\n- Ka6, Ka5, Kb4, Ka4: all move the king away from the center and are not optimal.\n\nLet's look at Be4:\n- Be4 attacks the knight on e2. If the knight moves, White can push d4-d5, supported by the bishop and king.\n\nLet's check if the knight has any good squares after Be4:\n- After Be4, the knight can go to f4, c3, g1, or g3.\n- Nf4: attacks the bishop, but then Kc6 supports the d-pawn push.\n- Nc3+: check, but after Kc6, the king is safe and supports the d-pawn.\n- Ng1: not threatening.\n- Ng3: attacks the bishop, but then Kc6.\n\nBe4 is a strong move, attacking the knight and preparing to push the d-pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBe4\n```"
