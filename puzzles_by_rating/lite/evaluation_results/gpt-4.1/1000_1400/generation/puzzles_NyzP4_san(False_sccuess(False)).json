When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White can try Qf6 or Nh6+, but after ...Kf8, Black is safe.\n2. **a5a4**: Prepares to support the a-pawn, but less direct than a3a2.\n3. **c8d7**: Develops the bishop, but not urgent.\n4. **g8f8**: Tucks the king away, but not necessary yet.\n5. **f7f6**: Blunts the bishop on c4, but weakens the king.\n6. **g6g5**: Gains space, but weakens the king.\n\n**Tactical checks:**\n- After 1...a2, White's best is probably Nh6+ Kf8 Qh8+ Ke7 Qf6+ Ke8, but Black is not in danger.\n- White can't stop the a-pawn easily.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **a3a2** is the most direct and powerful, threatening to promote and forcing White to respond.\n\nMy move:\n```\na3a2\n```"
