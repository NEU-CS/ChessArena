When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Needs careful calculation.\n2. ...Nc6: Develops a piece, attacks d4.\n3. ...Qe8 or ...Qe7: Defends f7, but is passive.\n4. ...h6: Attacks the queen, but weakens the kingside.\n5. ...g6: Attacks the queen, but weakens dark squares.\n6. ...Nd7: Develops a piece, but blocks the bishop.\n\nLet's calculate ...exd4:\n- 15...exd4 16. Qd5+ (threatening f7 and attacking b7) Kh8 17. Nc4 (threatening Nxb6) and White is very active.\n- 15...exd4 16. Nc4 (threatening Nxb6) Qe8 17. Qd5+ Be6 18. Qxb7 and White wins a pawn.\n\nWhat about ...Nc6:\n- 15...Nc6 develops a piece, attacks d4, and covers e5. If 16. Nc4 exd4 17. Nxb6 axb6 and Black is fine.\n\nWhat about ...Qe8:\n- 15...Qe8 16. Qxe8 Rxe8 17. Nc4 and White is better.\n\nWhat about ...h6:\n- 15...h6 16. Qf7+ Kh8 17. Nc4 and White is better.\n\nWhat about ...g6:\n- 15...g6 16. Qh6 exd4 17.
