If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

White can try Ra8+ K moves, but Black's king is safe for now. White's king is far from the queenside pawns.\n- **Rb6+**: After Kd5, Black doesn't gain much.\n- **Nb5**: After Ra8+, Black's king is exposed to checks.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Rxh3** is the best move. It wins a pawn, threatens to push the h-pawn, and keeps the initiative. White's king is active, but Black's rook and knight can coordinate to support the passed pawns.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nRxh3\n```"
