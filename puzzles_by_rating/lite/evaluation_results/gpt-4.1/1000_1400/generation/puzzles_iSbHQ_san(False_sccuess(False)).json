When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Kh2, Qg1 is mate. If Qxd1, Black loses the rook.\n2. **d3d2**: Rook invades second rank, threatening mate ideas.\n3. **a7g1**: Queen to g1, threatening mate on h2.\n4. **a7b8**: Queen steps back, but not threatening.\n5. **f7f6**: Pawn move, not urgent.\n6. **g6g5**: Pawn move, not urgent.\n7. **d3d4**: Rook centralizes, but not threatening.\n\n**Tactical check:**\n- Let's check if d3d1+ is mate or wins material.\n  - 1...Rd1+ 2.Qxd1 Qxa6, Black wins the a6 pawn and is up material.\n  - 1...Rd1+ 2.Kh2 Qg1+ 3.Kg3 (forced) Qe3+ 4.Kh2 Qg3+ 5.Kh1 Qe1+ and so on. But White can interpose with Qxe1.\n\n**What about d3d1+?**\n- 1...Rd1+ 2.Qxd1 Qxa6, Black wins the dangerous a6 pawn, removing White's main threat.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n- a7g1: 1...Qg1+ 2.Qxg1 Bxg1, but White's rook can check and win material.\n- d3d2: Threatens mate on g2, but White can defend with Qg1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to play 1...Rd1+, forcing White to exchange queens or lose the a6 pawn, removing White's main threat and keeping a winning position.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd3d1\n```"
