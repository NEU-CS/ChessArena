When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is a bit exposed, but White's king is also not super safe. Black's bishops are somewhat passive, especially the one on b8.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. c6d8: Knight takes bishop, wins the exchange (bishop for knight), but after Qxd8, White is still up material.\n2. c6e7+: Knight check, but after Kg7, not much follow-up.\n3. e2h5: Bishop attacks h5, but not threatening much.\n4. c2c5: Queen attacks b5 pawn, but not decisive.\n5. e3e4: Opens up the center, but could expose White's king.\n\nThe most forcing move is c6d8, capturing the bishop on b8. Let's check if there are any tactics for Black after that:\n\n1. c6d8 Qxc2 (threatening mate on d1, but White can defend with Bf1 or Qd1)\n2. c6d8 Qxd8 (Black recaptures, White is up a piece)\n\nAlternatively, c6e7+ is a check, but after Kg7, the knight is hanging and Black can take it.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the bishop:\n\n```\nc6d8\n```"
