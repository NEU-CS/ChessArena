Qg8+ (forcing, check)\n2. Bxf5+ (forcing, check)\n3. Rxh6+ (forcing, check)\n4. Qd7 (threatening mate on g7)\n5. Bxg7 (captures bishop, but not forcing)\n6. Qxa5 (captures pawn, not forcing)\n\nLet's analyze the most forcing move: **Qg8+**\n\n- Qg8+ Kg6 (only move)\n- Qe8+ (double check with bishop and queen)\n- ... K moves (only move is Kh7)\n- Bxf5# (checkmate)\n\nLet's check this line:\n1. Qg8+ Kg6\n2. Qe8+ Kh7\n3. Bxf5#\n\nThis is a forced mate in three.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQg8+\n```"
