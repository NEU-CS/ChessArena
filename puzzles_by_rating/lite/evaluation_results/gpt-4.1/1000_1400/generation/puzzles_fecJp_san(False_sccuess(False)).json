When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

After 10...Kf7, 11.Bxd5+ is check, and the king is very exposed.\n3. **e7d7** (King to d7): If 10...Kd7, White plays Qf5# (queen on f5, knight on g6 covers e7 and f8, bishop on c4 covers e6 and d5). This is mate.\n4. **e7e6** (King to e6): If 10...Ke6, White plays Nf4# (knight moves from g6 to f4, supported by the queen on h5, and it's mate).\n5. **e7d6** (King to d6): If 10...Kd6, White plays Qxd5# (queen on d5, knight on g6 covers e7 and f8, bishop on c4 covers e6 and d5). This is mate.\n6. **h7g6** (Pawn h7 takes knight on g6): If 10...hxg6, White plays Qxh8 (queen captures rook), but at least Black is not mated immediately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll king moves result in immediate checkmate. The only move that avoids instant mate is **hxg6**.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nh7g6\n```"
