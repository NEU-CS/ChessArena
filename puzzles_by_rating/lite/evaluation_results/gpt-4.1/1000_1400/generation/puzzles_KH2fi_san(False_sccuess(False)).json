When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The knight on f2 attacks h3 and g4, and the knight on d3 is central.\n- White's rook on d6 is active, but not attacking anything directly.\n- White's bishop on b3 eyes the g8 square, which could be useful if the black king is exposed.\n- White's knight on g3 is under some pressure but not attacked directly.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. **d6d8**: Rook to the 8th rank, challenging the black rook. If Black exchanges, White's bishop can recapture, activating itself.\n2. **b3g8**: Bishop to g8, attacking the h7 pawn, but there is no pawn on h7. However, this move could threaten a discovered attack if the rook moves.\n3. **g3h5**: Knight to h5, attacking g7 and f6, but f6 is not occupied.\n4. **g3f5**: Knight to f5, attacking g7 and d6, but not very effective.\n5. **h3h4**: Pawn move, not urgent.\n6. **c3c4**: Pawn move, attacking the knight on d3.\n\n**Critical Tactics:**\n- The move **d6d8** is very strong, as it threatens to exchange rooks and bring the bishop to d8, where it can support the advance of the c-pawn or attack the knight on d3.\n- If Black exchanges rooks, White's bishop becomes very active.\n- The move **c3c4** attacks the knight on d3, but Black can play bxc4, and White's bishop is then attacked.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **d6d8** is the most forcing and improves White's position, as it either wins the e8-rook or forces a favorable exchange.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd6d8\n```"
