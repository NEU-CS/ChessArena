If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Ka7\n- Moves the king to a7, still on the edge, but not much safer than a6.\n- White could play Qc5+ (check), forcing the king back to a6 or to b8.\n- After Qc5+, if Ka8, White has Qc8+ and could force perpetual or worse.\n\n### 2. Ka5\n- Moves the king to a5, but this square is also exposed.\n- White could play Qc3+ (check), and after Ka6, White could continue checking.\n\n### 3. Rb6\n- Blocks the check on the c-file, and also defends the b5 pawn.\n- If White plays Qc5, Black can play Ka5 or Ka7.\n- If White captures with Qxb5+, Black can play Ka7, and the queen is less active.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- Black's queen is attacking g2 and h3. If Black can get a check on f1 or g2, there may be mating threats.\n- Rb6 is a defensive move, but it also keeps the king safer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Rb6 is the best move, as it defends b5, blocks checks, and keeps the king safer.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nRb6\n```"
