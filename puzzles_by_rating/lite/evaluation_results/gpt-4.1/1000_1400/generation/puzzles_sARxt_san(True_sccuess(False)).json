Qxc6: Captures the dangerous c6 pawn, but check for tactics.\n2. Bb4+: Check, forcing White's king to move or block.\n3. Nxe3: Forks queen and bishop, but check for tactics.\n4. Qxe3+: Check, but White can block or capture.\n5. Rg8: Develops rook, but not urgent.\n6. h5/h6: Not urgent.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Qxc6**\n   - If Qxc6, White can play Bxc6, but that's not possible since the bishop is on b5 and the pawn is on c6.\n   - If Qxc6, does White have any tactics? White's queen is on d1, so no immediate threats.\n   - Qxc6 seems safe and wins a pawn.\n\n2. **Bb4+**\n   - If Bb4+, White can block with Bd2 or Nd2.\n   - If Bd2, then Qxc6 is possible next move.\n   - If Kf1, then Qxc6 is possible.\n   - Bb4+ is a forcing move, but does not win material immediately.\n\n3. **Nxe3**\n   - Nxe3 attacks the queen and bishop.\n   - If fxe3, then Qxe3+ is check, but White can block with Qe2 or Be2.\n   - If Qxe3+, White can play Be2 or Qe2.\n   - Nxe3 is interesting, but after fxe3, Black does not have a direct follow-up.\n\n4. **Qxe3+**\n   - Qxe3+ forces fxe3, then Nxe3 attacks the rook and bishop, but White can play Qe2.\n\n**Best move:**\n- Qxc6 wins a pawn and removes White's dangerous passed pawn. There are no immediate tactics for White after this move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxc6\n```"
