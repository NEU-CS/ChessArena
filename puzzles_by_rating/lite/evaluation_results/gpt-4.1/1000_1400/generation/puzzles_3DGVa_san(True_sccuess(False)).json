When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White's king is relatively safe, Black's king is a bit exposed.\n\nTactical ideas:\n- Qxd5+ is a check, attacking the bishop and king.\n- Qf8+ is a check, forcing Kg8-h7, but then what?\n- Qxa7 wins a pawn, but is it safe?\n- e6 opens lines, but is it necessary now?\n- White's queen is very active, Black's king is exposed.\n\nLet's check Qxd5+:\n\n1. Qxd5+ Rxd5 (forced, otherwise Black loses a piece)\n2. Nc3 (attacking the rook, threatening Nxd5)\n   - If Rxd5, then Nxd5, White is up a piece.\n\nBut after Qxd5+ Rxd5 Nc3, Black can play Rf7, defending d5.\n\nAlternatively, Qf8+:\n\n1. Qf8+ Rxf8 (forced)\n2. Nc3 (attacking the rook on d5)\n   - But Black can play Rxf2+ and get counterplay.\n\nAlternatively, Qxa7:\n\n1. Qxa7, just wins a pawn, but does not threaten anything immediate.\n\nAlternatively, Qxb5:\n\n1. Qxb5, wins a pawn, but again, not threatening anything.\n\nAlternatively, Qc7, threatening Qg7#.\n\nBut after Qc7, Black can play Rh5+ and get counterplay.\n\nAlternatively, Qc8, threatening Qxd8+.\n\nBut after Qc8, Black can play Rh5+.\n\nAlternatively, Qxd5+, let's check the line again:\n\n1. Qxd5+ Rxd5\n2. Nc3 Rf7 (defending d5)\n3. Nxd5 (if Rxd5, then Nxd5, White is up a piece)\n\nBut after Nc3, Black can play Rdf5, defending d5 again.\n\nAlternatively, Qxb5, just wins a pawn.\n\nAlternatively, Qc7, threatening Qg7#.\n\nLet's check Qc7:\n\n1. Qc7, threatening Qg7#\n   - Black must defend against mate, so Rdf8 or Rdf7.\n\nIf Rdf8, then Nc3, attacking the rook on d5.\n\nAlternatively, Qc7, Rdf8, Nc3, Rxf2+.\n\nAlternatively, Qxd5+ seems to be the most forcing.\n\nLet's check Qxd5+:\n\n1. Qxd5+ Rxd5\n2. Nc3 Rdf5 (defending d5)\n3. Nxd5 Rxd5\n\nWhite is up a piece.\n\nAlternatively, after Qxd5+ Rxd5, Nc3, Black can play Rh5+.\n\n1. Qxd5+ Rxd5\n2. Nc3 Rh5+ (trying to get counterplay)\n3. Kg1 (or Kg2), Black has no more checks.\n\nSo, Qxd5+ seems to win a piece.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQxd5+\n```"
