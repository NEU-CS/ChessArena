The only legal moves are:\n- Kg8\n- Kxg7\n\nLet's look at the board:\n\n- Black king is on h8.\n- White has a queen on h3, bishop on g7, bishop on e4, rook on f1, rook on a1, pawns on a2, b2, f2, h2, and g2.\n- Black has a queen on d8, rook on f8, rook on a6, bishop on e7, knight on d4, knight on b4, pawns on a5, e5.\n\nWhite's last move was likely Qh3, threatening mate on h7 (Qxh7#). The bishop on g7 is also attacking h8.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n- Kg8: Move the king from h8 to g8.\n- Kxg7: King captures the bishop on g7.\n\nLet's check both:\n\n1. **Kg8:**  \nIf Black plays Kg8, White can play Qh7# (checkmate). So this loses immediately.\n\n2. **Kxg7:**  \nIf Black plays Kxg7, the king captures the bishop on g7. Let's see if White has a forced mate:\n\n- After Kxg7, White can play Qh7# (since the king is now on g7, h7 is covered by the queen and the bishop on e4). So this is also checkmate.\n\nBut let's double-check:  \nAfter Kxg7, White's queen is on h3, so Qh7# is possible, and the king cannot escape.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth moves lead to immediate mate by White. However, the only legal moves are Kg8 and Kxg7. Since it's Black's move, and both lose, but the move must be made, let's choose one.\n\n**By convention, if both moves lose, but you must move, you play one. Let's play:**\n```\nKxg7\n```"
