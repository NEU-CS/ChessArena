When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black can only block with Rxg8, then White can play hxg8=Q+ and after Kxg8, White has a material advantage.\n2. **c4f7**: Queen to f7, attacking the rook and threatening mate on g7, but Black can defend.\n3. **c4e6**: Queen to e6, attacking the rook and threatening Qf6+.\n4. **h1h5**: Rook to h5, attacking the queen, but Black can ignore or defend.\n5. **d1d2**: Rook to d2, defending the second rank.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let's look at **c4g8**:\n    - 1. Qg8+ Rxg8\n    - 2. hxg8=Q+ Kxg8\n    - White is up a rook for a pawn, and Black's attack is blunted.\n\n- Let's check if there are any better moves:\n    - **c4f7**: Qf7 threatens mate, but Black can play Qxf7 or Rxf7.\n    - **c4e6**: Qe6 attacks the rook, but doesn't threaten mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **c4g8** leads to a decisive material advantage and eliminates Black's rook, while also promoting the h-pawn. This is the strongest move.\n\n```\nc4g8\n```"
