When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:**  \n- g5e4 (Ng5-e4)  \n- g5f3 (Ng5-f3)  \n- f2f3 (f2-f3)\n\n**Material count:**  \n- White: Queen (a7), Rook (h7), Knight (g5), Bishop (h3), pawns  \n- Black: Queen (e1), Bishop (c6), pawns\n\n**King safety:**  \n- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed.\n- White's king is on g2, relatively safe.\n\n**Threats:**  \n- Black threatens Qh1# if the g2-pawn moves or the h3-bishop leaves.\n- White has a queen and rook on the 7th rank, and a knight on g5.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n1. **Ng5-e4**: The knight moves to e4, attacking the bishop on c6 and defending f2. However, it leaves the h3-bishop hanging, but Black cannot take it due to mate threats.\n2. **Ng5-f3**: The knight moves to f3, defending h2 and covering e1. But this blocks the f-pawn and doesn't create immediate threats.\n3. **f2-f3**: The pawn moves to f3, attacking the queen on e1 and opening the g-file, but this allows Qh1# (mate), so this is not playable.\n\n**Immediate tactics:**\n- f2-f3 is illegal due to Qh1#.\n- Ng5-f3 is safe but passive.\n- Ng5-e4 attacks the bishop on c6 and threatens a discovered check if the bishop moves.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- After Ng5-e4, if Black plays Qxe4+ (taking the knight), White can respond with Qxe4, and the position is still safe.\n- If Black plays Bxe4+, White can play Qxe4, again safe.\n- If Black does nothing, White threatens Rh8# (if the bishop leaves c6).\n\n**Best move:**\n- Ng5-e4 is the most active, attacking the bishop and keeping up pressure.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng5e4\n```"
