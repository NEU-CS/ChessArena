When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This move would allow Qe4# (checkmate), since the king would be on a light square and the queen covers the escape squares.\n\n2. **f2g1 (King to g1):**\n   - The king moves to g1. This is a safe square, not attacked by any Black piece. The king is tucked away, and there is no immediate threat.\n\n3. **f2f1 (King to f1):**\n   - The king moves to f1. This is also a safe square, but it blocks the rook on h5 from swinging to the first rank if needed.\n\n4. **f2e1 (King to e1):**\n   - The king moves to e1. This is also a safe square, but it blocks the bishop on e2.\n\n**Best move:**\n\n- f2g1 is the safest move, as it tucks the king away from checks and does not block any of White's pieces. The king is less exposed on g1, and White can continue to press for an attack with the rook and queen.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf2g1\n```"
