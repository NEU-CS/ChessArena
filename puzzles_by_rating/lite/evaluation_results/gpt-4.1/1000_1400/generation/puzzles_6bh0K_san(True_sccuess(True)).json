If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If ...Kc7, then d6+ is strong. If ...Rd7, then Nxd8 wins the exchange.\n2. **dxc6**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n3. **d6**: Pushes the passed pawn, threatening d7.\n4. **Rxb7**: Captures a pawn, but the rook could be trapped after ...Qe2+.\n5. **Qa4**: Attacks the queen, but doesn't seem to create threats.\n6. **Bf3**: Attacks the knight on g3, but after ...Nxh1, Black gets material.\n\n**Calculation of Nf7+:**\n- 22. Nf7+ Kc7 (if ...Rd7, then Nxd8+ wins the rook)\n- 23. d6+ Rxd6 (if ...Kc8, then d7+ wins)\n- 24. Nxd6 Kxd6 (White is up material and has a strong attack)\n\nAlternatively:\n- 22. Nf7+ Rd7\n- 23. Nxd8 Rxd8\n- White wins the exchange and remains with a strong position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **Nf7+** is a forcing check that either wins material or leads to a strong attack. It is the most promising move.\n\n```\nNf7+\n```"
