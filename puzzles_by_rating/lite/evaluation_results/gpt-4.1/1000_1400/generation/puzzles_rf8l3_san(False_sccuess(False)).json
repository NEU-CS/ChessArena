When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

No immediate mate threats.\n- White has a powerful bishop on e4, knight on f4, and queen on f7.\n- White's pieces are very active and coordinate well for an attack.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. **f4h6**: Nxh6, attacking the rook on g8 and threatening Qxh7#.\n2. **f4g5**: N moves, but doesn't threaten much.\n3. **e4f6**: Bxf6, attacks the queen, but after Qxf6, not much.\n4. **f4g3**: N moves, but doesn't threaten much.\n5. **f4e3**: N moves, but doesn't threaten much.\n6. **e4g5**: B moves, but doesn't threaten much.\n7. **h1g1**: Rg1, brings another piece into the attack.\n\n**Tactical Considerations:**\n- After **Nxh6**, if Black plays Qg6, White has Qxg8+ Rxg8 Nf7# (smothered mate).\n- If Black plays Rxg1, Rxg1, White still threatens Qxg8+ and Nf7#.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. f4h6 (Nxh6)\n   - If Qg6, Qxg8+ Rxg8 Nf7# (mate)\n   - If Rxg1, Rxg1, White threatens Qxg8+ and Nf7# (mate)\n   - If Qe8, Qxg8+ Rxg8 Nf7# (mate)\n   - If Qh5, Qxg8+ Rxg8 Nf7# (mate)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Nxh6** is crushing and leads to forced mate or decisive material gain.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nf4h6\n```"
