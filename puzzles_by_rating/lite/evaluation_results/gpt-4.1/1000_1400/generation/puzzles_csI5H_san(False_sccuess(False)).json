When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:**  \n- b1a2 (King from b1 to a2)  \n- e3e4 (Queen from e3 to e4)  \n- e3d3 (Queen from e3 to d3)\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n- **Material:**  \n  White: Queen, Rook, Rook, Knight, 2 pawns (b2, e6), King (b1)  \n  Black: Queen, Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns, King (missing), Rook (missing)\n\n- **Threats:**  \n  Black's queen on f5 is active, and Black has a dangerous passed pawn on c4 and a knight on b3.  \n  White's king is on b1, somewhat exposed.  \n  White's queen is on e3, rooks on g1 and h1, knight on b5, pawn on e6 (advanced), pawn on a3, b2.\n\n- **Legal Moves Analysis:**  \n  1. **b1a2:** King moves to a2. This doesn't seem to address any threats or create any.  \n  2. **e3e4:** Queen moves to e4. This attacks the queen on f5, but Black can exchange queens, which may not be favorable given White's exposed king and Black's passed pawns.  \n  3. **e3d3:** Queen moves to d3. This defends the b3 square, attacks the c4 pawn, and keeps the queen centralized.\n\n- **Tactical Considerations:**  \n  - If White plays e3e4, after Qxe4+, fxe4, Black can play Nd2+ and pick up the rook on g1, which is very dangerous for White.\n  - If White plays e3d3, the queen covers the d-file, attacks c4, and keeps some defensive posture.\n  - If White plays b1a2, the king is still exposed, and Black can continue with Qxe5 or Qc2+.\n\n**Best Move:**\n\n- **e3e4** is dangerous due to the queen exchange and Black's knight fork.\n- **b1a2** is passive and doesn't improve White's position.\n- **e3d3** is the most solid, defending b3, attacking c4, and keeping the queen active.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\ne3d3\n```"
