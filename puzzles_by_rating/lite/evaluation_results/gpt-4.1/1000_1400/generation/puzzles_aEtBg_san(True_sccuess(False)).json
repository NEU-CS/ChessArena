White's queen is very active on g7, and the bishop on f3 is also well-placed. Black's queen and rook are coordinating, but the king is vulnerable.\n\nLet's look for forcing moves: checks, captures, threats.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **Qg6+**: Queen check on g6. Black can block with ...Re6 or ...Kc5.\n2. **Qf6+**: Queen check on f6. Black can play ...Re6 or ...Kc5.\n3. **Qe7+**: Queen check on e7. Black can play ...Rxe7 or ...Kc5.\n4. **c5+**: Pawn check. Black's king can only go to e5 or c5.\n5. **Qh6+**: Queen check. Black can play ...Re6 or ...Kc5.\n\nLet's examine **c5+**:\n- c5+ Kxc5 (if ...Kxc5) then Qe7+ wins the rook on e3.\n- c5+ Kxc5 Qe7+ Kb6 Qxe3 Qxe3 wins the rook, but Black's queen is active.\n- c5+ Kxc5 Qe7+ Kb6 Qxe3 Qxe3 Kg2, White is up a piece.\n\nWhat about **Qf6+**:\n- Qf6+ Kc5 (if ...Kc5) then b4+ Kxb4 Qb2+ Kc5 Qb6+ Kxc4 Qxf2, White is up a piece.\n- Qf6+ Re6 Qxe6+ Kc5 Qe3+ Kb4 Qxf2, again White is up a piece.\n\nWhat about **Qg6+**:\n- Qg6+ Kc5 (if ...Kc5) then b4+ Kxb4 Qb1+ Kc5 Qb6+ Kxc4 Qxf2, White is up a piece.\n\nWhat about **Qe7+**:\n- Qe7+ Rxe7, White loses the queen.\n\nWhat about **Qh6+**:\n- Qh6+ Kc5 (if ...Kc5) then b4+ Kxb4 Qb6+ Kxc4 Qxf2, White is up a piece.\n\nWhat about **Qxh7+**:\n- Qxh7+ Kc5, not as forcing.\n\n**Best move: c5+**\n\nThis move forces the Black king to move, and after Kxc5, White can play Qe7+ and win the rook on e3.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc5+\n```"
