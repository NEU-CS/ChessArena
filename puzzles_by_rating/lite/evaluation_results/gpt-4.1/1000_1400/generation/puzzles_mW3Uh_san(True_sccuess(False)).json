If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If ...Kg7, then Rc7+ is possible, attacking the a7 pawn and keeping pressure.\n2. **Bg7+**: Bishop check, but Black can block with Kg5 or Kg7, but then White loses the bishop.\n3. **Rc8**: Attacks the bishop on b1, but Black can play Rd1+ and get counterplay.\n4. **a5**: Pushes the pawn, but not urgent.\n5. **e4**: Opens up the center, but not immediately threatening.\n\n**Deeper look at Rh5+:**\n- 36. Rh5+! gxh5 (if ...Kg7, then Rc7+ wins a7)\n- If 36...Kg7, then 37. Rc7+ Kg8 38. Rg7+ Kf8 39. Rxg6 and White is winning.\n- If 36...Kg5, then 37. h4+ Kg4 38. h3+ Kf3 39. Rf5+ Ke2 40. Rf2+ Kd1 41. Bd4 and White is winning.\n\nBut after 36. Rh5+! Kxh5, White can play 37. Bf6 and Black is in trouble.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is the forcing check:\n\n```\nRh5+\n```"
