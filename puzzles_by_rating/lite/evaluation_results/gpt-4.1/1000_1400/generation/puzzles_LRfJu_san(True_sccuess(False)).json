If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Rfxf8+ Kh7 35. Rh8# is mate! So Bxe4 loses to a back rank mate.\n- **Bg4**: 33...Bg4 attacks the rook. If 34. Rfxf8+ Kh7 35. Rh8# again. So Bg4 also loses to mate.\n- **Bh5**: 33...Bh5, White can try Rfxf8+ Kh7, then Rh8+ Kg6, but no mate.\n- **b4**: 33...b4 34. Rfxf8+ Kh7 35. Rh8# is mate again.\n\n**Defensive necessity:**\n- The back rank is weak. The only way to prevent Rfxf8+ followed by Rh8# is to give the king an escape square or defend the back rank.\n\n**g5**: 33...g5 gives the king an escape square on g7 and h7, so after 34. Rfxf8+ Kh7 35. Rh8+ Kg6, Black is not mated.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is to play g5 to prevent back rank mate.**\n\n```\ng5\n```"
