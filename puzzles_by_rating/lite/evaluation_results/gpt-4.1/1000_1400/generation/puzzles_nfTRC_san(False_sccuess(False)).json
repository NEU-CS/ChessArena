When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...Kf7, then Qf8#.\n2. c5f8: Bishop takes rook, winning material.\n3. f2f5: Attacks the queen, but doesn't seem as strong as the above.\n4. f2h4: Attacks the queen, but again, not as strong.\n5. b1h7: Bishop check, but Black can block with Kf8.\n\nLet's calculate f2f7:\n- f2f7 threatens Qh7#.\n- If Black plays ...Kh8, then Qf8+ Kh7 Qg7#.\n- If ...Kf8, then Qf8# is mate.\n\nIs there any defense for Black after f2f7?\n- ...Qxc5+ is possible, but after Qxc5, Qxc5, Bxc5, White is still up a piece and the attack continues.\n- ...Qe3+ is possible, but after Qxe3, Bxe3, White is still up a piece.\n\nBut after f2f7, Black cannot stop Qh7# without giving up the queen or getting mated.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf2f7\n```"
