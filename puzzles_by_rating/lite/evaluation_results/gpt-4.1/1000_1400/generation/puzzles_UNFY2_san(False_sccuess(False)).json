When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

So this move loses instantly.\n\n**So, e6f5 is immediately losing.**\n\nBetween e6e7, e6d7, and e6d6, let's check for the safest king position and best winning chances.\n\n**After e6e7:**\n- White's queen is far from the action.\n- Black can push c3-c2 next, threatening c1=Q.\n- White has no checks.\n\n**After e6d7:**\n- White's queen can go to f7+ or g7+, but still no checks.\n- Black can push c3-c2.\n\n**After e6d6:**\n- White's queen can go to f8+ or g6+, but still no checks.\n- Black can push c3-c2.\n\n**But e6e7 keeps the king on a dark square, away from checks, and supports the c-pawn.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to play Ke7 (e6e7), keeping the king safe and preparing to push the c-pawn.\n\n```\ne6e7\n```"
