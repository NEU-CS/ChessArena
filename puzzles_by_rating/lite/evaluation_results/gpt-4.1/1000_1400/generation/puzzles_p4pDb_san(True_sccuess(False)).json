If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Let's check for tactics:\n\n- After Qf6, if White plays Qxf6, Black recaptures with Bxf6 (but there is no bishop), so with gxf6, White can play Ne6, but Black is still alive.\n- After Qf6, White cannot play Qh4+.\n\nTherefore, the only move to avoid immediate mate is:\n```\nQf6\n```"
