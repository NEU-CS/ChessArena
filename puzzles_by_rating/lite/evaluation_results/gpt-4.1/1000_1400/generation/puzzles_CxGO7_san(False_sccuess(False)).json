When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White exchanges queens, Black will be up material and the king will be safer.\n- If Black plays **h5h8** or **h5h7**, it's passive and allows White to continue attacking.\n- **c6d4** is tempting but after Qe7+ or Qe5+, White keeps the initiative.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **c6e5**: If White plays Qe5+, Black can block with Qxe5, Rxe5, and then Kf6, and Black is up material.\n- If White doesn't exchange, Black will have a safer king and can consolidate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is **c6e5**, attacking the queen and defending the rook, forcing a queen exchange or at least relieving pressure.\n\nMy move:\n```\nc6e5\n```"
