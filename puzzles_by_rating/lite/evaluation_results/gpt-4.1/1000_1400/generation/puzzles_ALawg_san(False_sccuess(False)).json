When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is relatively safe on f3, and White has a pawn majority on the kingside.\n- Black's rook is active on f4, and the king is centralized on e5. The pawn on d5 can advance to e6, but that opens the e-file for White's rook.\n- Black's best hope is to activate the rook and king to create counterplay, possibly by targeting White's pawns or creating threats against the White king.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **e5d6:** Retreats the king, possibly to support the d5 pawn, but loses activity and allows White to push b7.\n2. **e5f5:** Moves the king closer to the kingside, possibly supporting the rook and threatening to attack White's pawns.\n3. **d5e6:** Advances the pawn, but after Rxe6+ Kxe6, White's king becomes more active, and Black loses the d-pawn.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n- **e5f5:** This keeps the king active, eyes the g5 pawn, and supports the rook. If White pushes b7, Black can play Rf3+ and try to harass the White king.\n- **e5d6:** Passive, and after b7, White is close to queening.\n- **d5e6:** Loses the pawn for no compensation.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **e5f5** is the most active and keeps chances alive, threatening to attack White's pawns and keeping the king in the center.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne5f5\n```"
