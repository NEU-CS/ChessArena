Rxf3+ Kxf3 Bd5+ (forks king and rook)\n   - White must move the king, and Black wins the rook on e7 next move.\n   - After Bd5+, White's king must move (Ke2, Ke1, Kg2, Kg4, etc.), and Black plays Bxe7.\n   - Black will be up a rook and bishop for a pawn, with a winning endgame.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRxf3+ is a decisive tactic, winning the rook on e7 and securing a winning advantage.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRxf3+\n```"
