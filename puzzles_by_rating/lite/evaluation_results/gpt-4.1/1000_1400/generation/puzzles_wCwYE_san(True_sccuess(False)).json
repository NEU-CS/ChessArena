If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Ne5, attacking the bishop on g4 and threatening to open the center.\n\nAlternatively, Ne5 immediately attacks the bishop on g4 and threatens to capture on g4.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the move cxd5 is the most principled, opening the center while Black's king is still in the middle and White is well developed.\n\nMy move is:\n```\ncxd5\n```"
