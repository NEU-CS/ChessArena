If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Legal moves:** Qh2, gxh3\n\n**Material count:**\n- White: Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, 2 pawns (g2, d4), King (h1)\n- Black: Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, 5 pawns, King (f7)\n\n**Position:**\n- Black's last move was ...Rh3, threatening mate on h2.\n- White's king is on h1, and the only legal moves are Qh2 (blocking the check) or gxh3 (capturing the rook).\n\nLet's analyze both moves:\n\n1. **Qh2**\n   - Blocks the check, but after Qxh2+ Kxh2, Black is up a rook and a pawn, and White's king is exposed. White is losing.\n\n2. **gxh3**\n   - Captures the rook, but after Qh2# it's checkmate. So this move loses immediately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- gxh3 loses to Qh2#.\n- Qh2 is forced to block the check.\n\nTherefore, the only move that avoids immediate checkmate is:\n\n```\nQh2\n```"
