Ka6\n- Moves the king closer to support the a-pawn, but a6 is more direct.\n\n#### 3. Bc4\n- Attacks the knight, but the knight can move and White loses tempo.\n\n#### 4. g4\n- Opens the kingside, but the queenside is where White's advantage lies.\n\n#### 5. Other bishop moves (Bg8, Be8, Bg6, etc.)\n- Don't seem to create immediate threats or improve the position.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe most pressing plan is to push the a-pawn. Black's knight is too far to stop the pawn directly, and White's king is perfectly placed to support it. After a6, if Black tries ...Nd6+ or ...Nc3+, White can respond with Kc4 or Kb4, and the pawn will be unstoppable.\n\n### Final Move\n\nThe best move is to push the passed pawn:\n\n```\na6\n```"

The only legal moves are with the king: Kc5, Ka5, Kb4, Ka4.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Kc5:**  \n   - Moves closer to the center and the knight.\n   - Black could play Nxf7, but that's not possible as the knight is on d6 and the bishop is on f7.\n   - Black could play Nxf7 if the bishop moves, but not now.\n   - Black could play Ne4+ (check), but after Kd5, White is still safe.\n\n2. **Ka5:**  \n   - Moves away from the action, not very active.\n\n3. **Kb4:**  \n   - Stays on the b-file, but doesn't threaten anything.\n\n4. **Ka4:**  \n   - Even further away from the center.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- White is up a bishop for a pawn.\n- The a6 pawn is a passed pawn and can be promoted if supported.\n- The king should stay active and support the a-pawn.\n\n**Best Plan:**\n- The king should stay close to the a6 pawn to support its advance.\n- Kc5 keeps the king active and central, and can help push the a-pawn.\n\n**Tactical Considerations:**\n- After Kc5, if Black plays Nxf7, White loses the bishop, but that's not possible as the bishop is protected by the pawn on g3.\n- Black's knight can try to harass the king, but White's king is safe on c5.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to play Kc5, keeping the king active and central, supporting the a-pawn.\n\n```\nKc5\n```"

The move a7 is possible.\n- Black's king is on c7, so after a7, the pawn is one step from promotion, but the king can move to b7 or c8 to try to stop it.\n- The knight on f7 is not immediately threatening anything, but could try to get to d6 to block the pawn.\n- The king on c5 is well placed to support the a-pawn.\n- Advancing the g-pawn (g4) is possible, but the main action is on the queenside.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **a7**: Pushes the pawn to the 7th rank, threatening to promote. After a7, Black must respond. If Kb7, then Kd5 attacks the e5 pawn and supports a8=Q. If Kc8, then Kb6 and a8=Q is unstoppable.\n2. **g4**: Not urgent, as the queenside action is more important.\n3. **King moves (Kd5, Kb5, Kc4, Kb4)**: These don't immediately improve the position compared to a7.\n\n**Calculation after a7:**\n- a7\n  - If Kb7, then Kd5 (attacking e5 and threatening a8=Q)\n  - If Kc8, then Kb6 (threatening a8=Q, and Black cannot stop it)\n- Black's knight is too far to stop the pawn.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to push the a-pawn to a7, threatening promotion and forcing Black to respond.

Let's consider the promotion options:\n\n1. **a8=Q+**: Promoting to a queen with check. The Black king is on b7, so after a8=Q+, Black must respond. The only legal move is Kxa8 (since the queen is on a8 and the king is on b7). But that's not correct: after a8=Q+, the king can't take the queen because it's not adjacent. The king can only move to c7 or c8, but both are not available. Let's check carefully:\n\n- a8=Q+: King is on b7, queen appears on a8. The king cannot move to a8 (occupied), cannot move to a7 (pawn), cannot move to c7 (not available), cannot move to b8 (not available). Wait, let's check the squares:\n    - a7: occupied by pawn\n    - a8: occupied by new queen\n    - b8: empty\n    - c8: empty\n    - c7: empty\n    - b6: empty\n\nBut after a8=Q+, the king can move to c7 or b6, but let's check if those are legal.\n\nBut the king is on b7, so after a8=Q+, the king can move to c7 or b6.\n\n2. **a8=R**: Similar, but less powerful than a queen.\n\n3. **a8=B+**: Promoting to a bishop with check, but less powerful than a queen.\n\n4. **a8=N**: Promoting to a knight with check, but not as strong as a queen.\n\n5. **g4**: Advancing the g-pawn, but not urgent.\n\n6. **King moves**: Not urgent.\n\n**Best move:**\n\nPromoting to a queen with check is the most powerful. Let's check the consequences:\n\n- a8=Q+ Kxa8 is not possible (queen is on a8, king is on b7).\n- a8=Q+ Kc7: King moves to c7.\n- a8=Q+ Kb6: King moves to b6.\n\nBut after a8=Q+, the king can move to c7 or b6.\n\nAfter a8=Q+ Kc7, White can play Kd5, threatening to invade with the king and support the g-pawn.\n\nBut let's check if there's any danger from Black's knight and pawns. The knight is on f7, and Black has pawns on e5 and g5.\n\nWhite is completely winning after promoting to a queen.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to promote the pawn to a queen with check.\n\n```\na8=Q+\n```"
