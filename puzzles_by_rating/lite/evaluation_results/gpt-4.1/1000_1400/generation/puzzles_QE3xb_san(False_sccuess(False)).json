When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black plays Nxc7, White can recapture with bishop or rook.\n2. **c4f7** (Bc4-f7): Check, but Black can simply capture with Rxf7.\n3. **c3d5** (Nc3-d5): Centralizes the knight, attacks f6, and threatens Nxf6+.\n4. **c4e6** (Bc4-e6): Attacks the knight on f6 and threatens to win material.\n5. **e3e4**: Opens the center, but Black's pieces are not ideally placed to exploit it.\n\n**Deep calculation:**\n- **b5c7**: If Nb5-c7, Black must respond. If Qxc7, White wins the exchange after Bxa6. If Rb8, White can play Nxa6, winning a pawn and threatening more.\n- **c4e6**: If Bc4-e6, fxe6 is forced, then White can play Nxe6, forking queen and rook, but there is no queen on the board. So, not as strong.\n- **c3d5**: Nc3-d5 attacks f6 and c7, but Black can play Nxd5, exd5, and White has a strong center.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **b5c7** is a clear fork, attacking both the rook on a8 and the bishop on c8. Black cannot defend both. After Nb5-c7, if Rb8, then Nxa6, and White wins a pawn and keeps up the pressure.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb5c7\n```"
