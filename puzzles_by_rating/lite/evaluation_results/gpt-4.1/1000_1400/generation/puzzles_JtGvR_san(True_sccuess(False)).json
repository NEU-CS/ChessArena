If not, Black wins a pawn.\n- O-O: Safe, brings rook into play, threatens f5-f4 in the future, and secures king.\n\n**Let's check Qxg3:**\n1. ... Qxg3\n2. hxg3 Rxb2+ (check)\n3. Rxb2 Bxb2\n\nBlack wins a pawn and the bishop on b2, gaining material.\n\n**Is there any better?**\n- O-O is safe, but Qxg3 wins material immediately.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe best move is:\n```\nQxg3\n```"
