When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxg7+ (g4g7): This is a forcing move. If ...Kxg7, then Rxf7+ wins the queen on d3.\n2. Rb8: Pins the rook on f8, but doesn't threaten immediate tactics.\n3. Rxa7: Wins a pawn, but not as forcing as Qxg7+.\n4. Qe4: Attacks the queen and threatens mate on h7, but Black can defend.\n5. Qc8: Threatens mate on f8, but Black can defend with ...Qd8.\n\nLet's calculate Qxg7+:\n1. Qxg7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n2. Rxf7+ Rxf7 (forced)\n3. Qg3+ (check, but Black can block with Qg6 or Kh7)\nBut after 2...Rxf7, White can play Qg3+ and then Qxd3, winning the queen.\n\nLet's check the sequence:\n1. Qxg7+ Kxg7\n2. Rxf7+ Rxf7\n3. Qg3+ Qg6 (forced)\n4. Qxg6+ Kxg6\n\nMaterial after this: White has a rook and two pawns vs. Black's rook and three pawns. White is still up a pawn, but the queens are off.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Qxg7+ Kxg7 2. Rxf7+ Kg8, White can play Qg6+ and win the rook on f8.\n\nLet's check that:\n1. Qxg7+ Kxg7\n2. Rxf7+ Kg8\n3. Qg6+ Kh8 (if Kh8)\n4. Qxh6+ Kg8\n5. Qg7#\n\nSo after 3. Qg6+, Black must play Kh8, then Qxh6+ Kg8 Qg7# is mate.\n\nTherefore, the move Qxg7+ is winning by force.\n\nMy move is:\n```\ng4g7\n```"
