If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Qxe1 (forced, otherwise White loses the queen or gets mated)\n- 15...Qxd3 (captures the bishop, regains material)\n- Now, material is even, but Black has won a pawn (since White's c3 pawn is hanging).\n- After 16. Ne5 (forking queen and rook), but the queen can move to f5 or d8, defending the rook.\n\n**Let's check the calculation:**\n\n1. 14...Re1+ 15. Qxe1 Qxd3 16. Ne5 (threatening Nxd3, but also attacking the queen)\n   - 16...Qe4 (defends rook, attacks bishop)\n   - 17. Qxe4 Nxe4 (Black is up a pawn, and the position is simplified)\n\nThis seems to be the best line for Black, as it wins a pawn and simplifies the position.\n\n**Other moves like Bd7 or Qd8 are too passive and don't challenge White's center.**\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\nRxe1+\n```"
