If gxh6, then Qxf6 threatens mate on g7. Black can defend with Re6 or Qe7, but White has strong pressure.\n2. **Qxf6**: Immediately wins a piece, but Black can recapture with Bxf6, so this is just an exchange.\n3. **Bg5**: Attacks the bishop on f6, but Black can play hxg5 or Bxg5, not as forcing.\n4. **Qf4/Qg3+**: Qg3+ checks, but Black can block with Bg7 or Kh8.\n5. **Rd3/Rfe1**: Doubling rooks, but not as urgent as the tactical Bxh6.\n\n**Calculation of Bxh6:**\n- 1. Bxh6 gxh6 (forced)\n- 2. Qxf6 (threatening mate on g7)\n- If Black plays Re6, then Qxf7+ Kh8 Qxe6 fxe6, White is up a pawn and Black's king is exposed.\n- If Black plays Qe7, then Qg6+ Kh8 Qxh6+ Kg8 Rf3, White's attack continues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bxh6 is a strong tactical shot, opening the g-file and exposing Black's king. The attack is very dangerous for Black, and White has a clear initiative.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nBxh6\n```"
