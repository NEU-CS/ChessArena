When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxb4: Exchange queens, but lose some attacking potential.\n2. Qc2: Retreat queen, keep pressure.\n3. Qa2: Retreat queen, stay on the a-file.\n4. Qb1: Retreat queen, defend d3 and keep the queen on the board.\n5. Bxg6: Not possible, as bishop is on e3.\n6. Bd2: Not in the legal moves.\n7. d3-g6: Bishop to g6, attacking the knight and threatening mate ideas.\n\n**Best Candidate:**\n- d3g6: Bishop to g6 attacks the knight on f6 and threatens Bxe8 if the rook moves. Also, it creates threats on the kingside and keeps the initiative.\n\nLet's check for tactics:\n- After d3g6, if hxg6, then Qxb4 and White wins a piece.\n- If Rf8, then Qxb4 and White is up material.\n- If ...Ree7, then Qxb4 and White is up material.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to play d3g6, attacking the knight and creating tactical threats.\n\n```\nd3g6\n```"
