If we play **cxb3**, after axb3, White's rook on a1 is active, but Black can try to contest the b-file. However, if we don't capture, White will play bxc4, and the queen will have to move anyway.\n\n**cxb3** is the most forcing move, and after axb3, Black can consider Rad8 or Rec8 to contest the b-file.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ncxb3\n```"
