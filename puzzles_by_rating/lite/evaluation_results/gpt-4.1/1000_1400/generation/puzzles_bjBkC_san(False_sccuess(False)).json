When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black ignores, bxa7 is coming.\n2. f2xa7: Grabs a pawn, but after Qxa7, White's queen is a bit offside and Black can play b6, solidifying.\n3. f3-g5: Attacks e6 bishop, but after h5, the bishop must retreat.\n4. f3-d4: Centralizes, but doesn't threaten much immediately.\n\nb5-b6 seems the most promising, opening lines against the Black king and threatening to win material or open files for the rooks.\n\nLet's check for tactics:\n- After b5-b6, if axb6, then a4 and the a-file is open.\n- If Qxb6, then Nd4 attacks the queen and c6.\n- If Qd7, then bxa7 wins a pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb5b6\n```"
