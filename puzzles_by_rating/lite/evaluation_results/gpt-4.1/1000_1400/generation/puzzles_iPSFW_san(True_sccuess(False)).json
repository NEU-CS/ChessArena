When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If Kb6, then Nxa6+ is possible.\n2. **Nc6+**: Knight check, but after Kb6, the knight is attacked and must move.\n3. **Nxa6+**: Captures a pawn with check, but after Kb6, the knight is attacked.\n4. **e6**: Advance the pawn, but no immediate threat.\n5. **Other rook moves**: Not as forcing as Rxc7+.\n\n**Calculating Rxc7+:**\n- 1. Rxc7+ Kb6 (forced)\n- 2. Nxa6 (threatening to take b5 next)\n- Black's rook is still active, but White has won a pawn and has a dangerous passed a-pawn.\n\n**Calculating Nc6+:**\n- 1. Nc6+ Kb6 (forced)\n- 2. Nxa6 (again, threatening b5)\n- But after Kxa6, the knight is lost.\n\n**Calculating Nxa6+:**\n- 1. Nxa6+ Kb6\n- 2. Nb4 (retreat), but this is not as strong as Rxc7+.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Rxc7+** is the most forcing move, wins a pawn, and keeps the initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxc7+\n```"
