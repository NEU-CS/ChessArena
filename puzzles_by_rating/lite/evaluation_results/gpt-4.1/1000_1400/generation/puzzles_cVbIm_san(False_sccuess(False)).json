When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's rook is on f7, which can be doubled or used to pressure White's pawns. White's rook is on e2, possibly aiming to invade the seventh rank.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f7g7: Rook to open file, but doesn't threaten much.\n2. f7e7: Rook to e7, challenging White's rook, but White can trade and try to activate the king.\n3. f7f8: Rook back to f8, passive.\n4. h5h4+: Pawn check, but White can play Kxh4, and the h-file opens for White's rook.\n5. d4d3: Pushes the passed pawn, but White can play cxd3, and after Kf5, White's king is active.\n6. a7a5 or b6b5: Pawn pushes on the queenside, but not urgent.\n\nThe most pressing plan is to activate the rook and/or push the passed d-pawn. However, d4d3 is not effective immediately. The move f7e7 is interesting, as it challenges White's rook and could lead to simplification, but White's king is closer to the center.\n\nAnother idea is to play f7g7, keeping the rook active and possibly preparing h5-h4+.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to keep the rook active and flexible. Moving the rook to g7 keeps options open and prevents White's king from advancing via h4.\n\nMy move:\n```\nf7g7\n```"
