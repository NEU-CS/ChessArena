When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position:\n\nWhite: King on b5, Bishop on f5, Pawn on d3, Pawn on g4  \nBlack: King on d4, Knight on e2\n\nWhite to move.\n\nMaterial: White is up a bishop and two pawns vs knight. Black's king is active, but White's bishop and pawns are well placed. The bishop on f5 is very strong, controlling key diagonals and helping to shepherd the pawns.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Bishop moves: f5c8, f5h7, f5d7, f5g6, f5e6, f5e4\n- King moves: b5c6, b5b6, b5a6, b5a5, b5b4, b5a4\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\n1. Bishop moves:\n   - f5c8: Attacks the a6 square, but doesn't threaten much.\n   - f5h7: Not relevant.\n   - f5d7: Attacks the knight, but the knight is protected by the king.\n   - f5g6: Attacks the knight, but again, not decisive.\n   - f5e6: Checks the king. Let's see: after ...Kxd3, White can play d4, but Black's king is very active.\n   - f5e4: Attacks the knight, but the knight is protected.\n\n2. King moves:\n   - b5c6: Centralizes the king, attacks d5 and b7.\n   - b5b6: Heads for promotion squares.\n   - b5a6: Not relevant.\n   - b5a5: Not relevant.\n   - b5b4: Retreats.\n   - b5a4: Retreats.\n\nThe most promising plan is to centralize the king and support the advance of the d-pawn. The move b5c6 is strong, as it brings the king closer to the center and supports d3-d4. Black's knight is awkwardly placed, and White's bishop can help support the pawns.\n\nLet\u2019s check for tactics: Is there any immediate threat from Black? The knight on e2 can jump to f4 or c3, but neither is immediately dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb5c6\n```"
