If ...Rxg8, then hxg8=Q+ is mate next move. If ...Kxg8, then Qg8# is mate. But Black can't play Kxg8 since the king is already on h8. Let's see:\n   - 1. Qg8+ Rxg8 2. hxg8=Q+ Rxg8 3. Qc3+ Rg7 4. Qxg7#\n   - But after 1. Qg8+ Rxg8 2. hxg8=Q+ Rxg8, White has lost the h-pawn and the queen, but can recapture on g8 with the rook, but Black's king is still on h8.\n   - Let's check the line: 1. Qg8+ Rxg8 2. hxg8=Q+ Rxg8 3. Qc3+ Rg7 4. Qxg7# (but after 3...Rg7, White can take on g7 with the queen, which is mate).\n   - So, 1. Qg8+ Rxg8 2. hxg8=Q+ Rxg8 3. Qc3+ Rg7 4. Qxg7#\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nQg8+ is a forced mate in 4. This is the best move.\n\n```\nQg8+\n```"
