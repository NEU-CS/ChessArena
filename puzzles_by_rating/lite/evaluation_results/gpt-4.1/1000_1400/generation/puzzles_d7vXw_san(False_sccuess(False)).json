When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

There are mating threats on h2 (Qxh2# if the h3 pawn moves or is captured).\n- The rook on d5 is active, and Black's pawn structure is solid.\n- White's king is exposed, but the queen and rook are defending.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **e2e5**: Centralizes the queen, attacks the rook on d5, and blocks the e-file.\n2. **e2e4**: Same idea, but less direct pressure.\n3. **e2e6**: Attacks the rook on d5 and pawn on a6, but the queen could be vulnerable.\n4. **d2d3**: Defends the h3 pawn, but is passive.\n5. **h3h4**: Weakens the king, but could try to drive away the queen.\n6. **f3f4**: Attacks the queen, but opens the king.\n7. **f1f2**: Defends h2, but blocks the queen.\n8. **a3a4**: Not urgent.\n\n**Critical lines:**\n- If White plays e2e5, Black must respond to the threat on the rook.\n- If White plays f3f4, Black can play Rxh3+ and after gxh3 Qxh3+ Kg1 Qh1+ Kf2 Qg2+ Ke1 Qg1# (mate).\n- If White plays h3h4, Black can play Qxh4 and White is mated after gxh4 Rxh4+ Kg1 Qh2+ Kf2 Qxg2+ Ke1 Qg1#.\n\n**Defensive priorities:**\n- The h3 pawn is critical. If it falls, mate is imminent.\n- The queen must stay on the e-file to help defend.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **e2e5** is the most active, attacking the rook and keeping the queen on the e-file to defend h2. It also threatens Qb8+ if the rook moves.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne2e5\n```"
