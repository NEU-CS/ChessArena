Ra2 Bd4 18. Rxd4 (if White wants to exchange) Bxa2, but then Nc3 and the bishop is trapped.\n- **Rd8**: 17. Nc3 (developing), then Ba6+ 18. Bb5 Bxb5+ 19. Nxb5 Bxc3 20. Nxc3, White is up a piece.\n- **Bc5**: 17. Nc3, White develops and threatens to double rooks.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Bxb2** is risky because the bishop can get trapped.\n- **Ba6+** is not effective.\n- **Rd8** is solid, contesting the open file and preparing to bring the rook into play. It also indirectly defends the bishop on d4 by increasing the coordination of Black's pieces.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRd8\n```"
