This removes a dangerous passed pawn and threatens to capture on f6 next. Black's king is far from the action on the kingside, and White's b-pawn is a dangerous passer.\n\n2. **Kxf6:** White king captures the pawn on f6. This also removes a dangerous pawn and threatens to capture on g6 next. However, after ...Kxe4, White's king is further from the queenside, where the b-pawn is ready to run.\n\n3. **Ke6:** White king moves to e6, attacking the f6 and e5 pawns. However, after ...Kxe4, White's king is not immediately threatening to capture on the kingside.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- The b-pawn is very close to queening.\n- The kingside pawns are dangerous for both sides.\n- Capturing on g6 or f6 removes Black's passed pawns and gives White a clear path to push the b-pawn.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Kxg6**:\n    - If ...Kxe4, then Kxf6, and White can push the b-pawn.\n    - If ...Kxe4, Kxf6 Kd4, b7, Kxe4, Kxg6, and White is winning.\n\n- **Kxf6**:\n    - If ...Kxe4, then Kxg6, and White is in a similar situation as above.\n\n- **Ke6**:\n    - If ...Kxe4, then Kxf6, but Black may have time to attack the b-pawn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth Kxg6 and Kxf6 are strong, but Kxg6 is slightly better because it immediately removes the most advanced passed pawn and keeps the king closer to the center and queenside, supporting the b-pawn.\n\n**Best move:**\n```\nKxg6\n```"
