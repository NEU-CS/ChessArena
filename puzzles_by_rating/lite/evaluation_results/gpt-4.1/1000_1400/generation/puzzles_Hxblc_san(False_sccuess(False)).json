When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Rxg5 (or Qxa8) Qxg1+ 28. Rxg1 Nxc4\n- **g5f4**: 26...Qxf4+ 27. Qxf4 Nf6 (defends e4, but White is active)\n- **d4d3**: 26...d3 27. Qxa8 Qxf4+ 28. Kb1 dxc2+ 29. Kxc2 Qf2+ 30. Kc3 Qxg1\n\n**Best move:**\n- **d4d3** is very strong, threatening d2 and opening lines against White's king. If White grabs the rook with Qxa8, Black gets a dangerous passed pawn and attacking chances.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd4d3\n```"
