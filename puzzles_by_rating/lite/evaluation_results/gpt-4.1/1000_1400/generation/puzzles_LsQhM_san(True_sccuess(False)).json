Qxg2+ (gives check, forcing White's king to h1, but after ...Qxg2+ Kxg2, Black loses the queen and is mated soon)\n2. ... Qe1+ (check, but White can block with Rxe1 or Qxe1)\n3. ... Qd1+ (check, White can block with Rxd1)\n4. ... Qe3+ (check, White can block with Rxe3 or Qxe3)\n5. ... Qxd4+ (check, White can block with Bxd4 or Qe3)\n6. ... h5 (does not stop mate)\n7. ...
