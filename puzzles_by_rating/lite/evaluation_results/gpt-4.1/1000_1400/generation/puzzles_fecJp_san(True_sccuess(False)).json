If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

After Nxh8, White wins the exchange and keeps up the attack.\n2. **Kf7:** Moves into a discovered check after Nxh8+ (since the bishop on c4 covers f7), and the king is still exposed.\n3. **Kd7:** Moves the king to d7, but after Qxd5+ White wins a pawn with check and keeps up the pressure.\n4. **Ke6:** Moves the king forward, but after Nf4+ or Qxd5+ White keeps up the attack.\n5. **Kd6:** Same as above, Qxd5+ is strong.\n6. **hxg6:** Captures the knight, but after Qxh8 White wins a rook for a knight, a significant material loss.\n\n**Critical lines:**\n\n- If hxg6 Qxh8, White wins a rook.\n- If Ke8 Nxh8, White wins the exchange.\n- If Kd7 Qxd5+ is strong.\n- If Ke6, White can play Nf4+ or Qxd5+.\n\n**Is there any way to avoid losing material immediately?**\n\n- All king moves lose material or allow a strong attack.\n- hxg6 loses the rook.\n\n**Best defense:**\n\n- Among the king moves, **Ke8** at least keeps the king on the back rank and avoids immediate checks. After Nxh8, White wins the exchange, but Black can try to consolidate and develop the bishop and rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nKe8\n```"
