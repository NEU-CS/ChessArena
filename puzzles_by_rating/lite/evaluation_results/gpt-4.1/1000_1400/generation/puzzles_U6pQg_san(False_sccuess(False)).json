When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black loses the right to castle, and White's queen is very active.\n\n**Alternative:**\n- Move the queen to a square where it is not attacked and keeps defending the bishop on b7. Let's check Qg6:\n  - Qg6, then White can play Nxg6+, Kxg6, h5+ (but the king can escape).\n- Qe6: Defends the bishop, but White can play Qxc7.\n\n**Is there a better defensive move?**\n- Qxe7 is forced, otherwise Black loses the queen or bishop.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to capture the knight with the queen.\n\n```\nf6e7\n```"
