When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black plays Qxg7, then hxg7+ is mate.\n2. **h5h6**: Threatens Qg7#, but Black can play g6.\n3. **e5f7**: Forks king and queen, but the king can move to g8.\n4. **b5e8**: Check, but loses the bishop.\n\n**Calculation for g3g7:**\n- 1. Qg7 Qxg7 (forced)\n- 2. hxg7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n- 3. Rdg1+ Kf8 (only move)\n- 4. Rxh8+ Ke7\n- 5. Rg7+ Kd6\n- 6. Rxb7\n\nBut after 1...Qxg7, 2. hxg7+ Kxg7, White can double rooks on the h-file and attack.\n\n**Calculation for e5f7:**\n- 1. Nf7 Qxf7 (forced)\n- 2. Qb8+ Qe8\n- 3. Qxe8#\n\nBut after 1. Nf7, Black can play Qxf7, and White doesn't have a follow-up.\n\n**Calculation for h5h6:**\n- 1. h6 g6 (forced)\n- 2. Qxg6 hxg6\n- 3. Nxg6+ Kg8\n- 4. Nxe7+ Kf7\n\nNot as convincing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **g3g7** is the most forcing and threatens mate. Black is forced to give up the queen or get mated.\n\nMy move is:\n```\ng3g7\n```"
