If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Let's check if White can capture the queen: Qxf6 gxf6, White has no immediate mate, but Black is down a queen for a rook and pawn.\n\nOther moves (like Qe8, Qe7, etc.) do not cover f7, so Qf7# is mate.\n\nTherefore, the only move to avoid immediate mate is:\n\n```\nQf6\n```"
