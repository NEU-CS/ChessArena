If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Pawns: a2, b2, c2, e4, h4.\n- Black: Queenless, both rooks, both bishops, both knights. Pawns: a6, b7, e5, h6, g7.\n\n**Positional assessment:**\n- White's knight on c5 is very active, hitting b7 and a6.\n- White's bishop on e3 eyes the a7-g1 diagonal.\n- White's rook on d1 is well placed.\n- Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's bishop on b6 is strong, but the knight on d4 is centralized.\n- White has a potential for tactics due to the active pieces.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **Ne6+**: Immediate check, forcing Black's king to move. If ...fxe6, then Bxd4+ wins a piece.\n2. **Nxb7**: Grabbing a pawn, attacking the rook on a8 and bishop on b6.\n3. **Nd7**: Forking the rook on f8 and bishop on b6.\n4. **Bxa6**: Capturing the pawn, but less forcing.\n5. **Rhg1+**: Bringing the rook into play with check.\n\nLet's analyze **Ne6+** in detail:\n\n- **22. Ne6+**\n    - If ...fxe6, then Bxd4+ wins a piece (since the knight on d4 is pinned to the king).\n    - If ...Nxe6, then Bxb6 wins a piece.\n    - If ...Kg8, then Nxf8, winning the exchange.\n\n**Ne6+** looks very strong, as it creates immediate tactical threats and may win material.\n\nLet's check the other candidate, **Nd7**:\n- Attacks the rook and bishop, but Black can play Bxd7 or Bc7, defending.\n\n**Nxb7**:\n- Grabs a pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n**Rhg1+**:\n- King can go to h7 or h8, but doesn't seem to lead to a direct win.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Ne6+** is the strongest move, creating multiple threats and likely winning material.\n\nMy move:\n```\nNe6+\n```"
