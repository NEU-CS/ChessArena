If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is exposed, and the knight on f4 is dangerous but also vulnerable. The queen on a6 is far from the kingside.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- **Bh7+**: Immediate check, forces Kf8 or Kh8. If Kf8, then Rxd8 wins a piece (since the bishop on e8 is pinned to the king). If Kh8, then Qh4 threatens mate.\n- **Bxe5**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't threaten immediate tactics.\n- **Nd5**: Attacks the queen and bishop, but Black can play Nxd5.\n- **Qh4**: Threatens mate on h7, but Black can defend with Ng6.\n- **Rxd8**: Wins a piece, but only if the bishop is pinned (after Bh7+ Kf8).\n\n**Let's calculate Bh7+:**\n1. Bh7+ Kf8\n   - Now Rxd8 wins a piece, since the bishop on e8 is pinned.\n   - If Black tries to defend with Qe6, White can play Qh4, threatening mate.\n   - If Kh8, Qh4 threatens mate, and Black cannot defend both f6 and h7.\n\n**Let's check for any defensive resources for Black after Bh7+:**\n- After Bh7+ Kf8 Rxd8, Black cannot recapture with the queen because it's on a6, and the bishop is pinned.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBh7+ is the strongest move, as it forces a decisive attack or wins material.\n\n```\nBh7+\n```"
