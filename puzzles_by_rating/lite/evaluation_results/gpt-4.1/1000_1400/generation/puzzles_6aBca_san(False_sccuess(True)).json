When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves: f2g3, f2g1\n\nLet's break down the situation:\n\n- White's king is on f2, under some pressure.\n- Black's queen is on e4, threatening various checks and attacks.\n- White's queen is on a7, not immediately threatening anything.\n- White's rook is on d3 and e1.\n- White's bishop is on c1.\n- Black's bishop is on d8.\n- Black's rook is on f8.\n- Black's knight is on g4.\n- Black's pawns are not immediately threatening.\n\nLegal moves:\n1. f2g3 (King to g3)\n2. f2g1 (King to g1)\n\nLet's analyze both:\n\n1. **f2g3**: King moves to g3.\n   - Is this safe? Black can play Qe1+ (check), forcing White's king to h4 or f4, which looks very dangerous. After Qe1+, White's only move is Kxg4, but then ...h5+ and the king is exposed. This looks very dangerous and likely losing.\n\n2. **f2g1**: King moves to g1.\n   - Is this safe? Black can play Qxe1, but then White can recapture with the rook or bishop. However, after Qxe1 Rxe1, Black still has a dangerous attack, but White is not immediately mated.\n\nBetween the two, **f2g1** is much safer. Moving to g3 walks into a forced mate or loss of material.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf2g1\n```"
