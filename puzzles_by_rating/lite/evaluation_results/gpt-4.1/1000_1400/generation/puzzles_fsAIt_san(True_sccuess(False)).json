If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

If White plays f5, then Qd5 is possible, trading queens and relieving pressure. If White plays Bxd5, then Qxd5 and the queen is active.\n- **Bd5**: If Bxd5, cxd5, White's knight is still strong, and the pawn structure is weakened.\n- **Rf7**: Defends, but after Nxf7, Rxf7, White can play Qe6, forking rook and bishop.\n- **Kh8**: Passive, doesn't solve problems.\n- **Qf7**: Loses material after Nxf7.\n\n**Best move: Qe6**\n\nIt attacks the knight, covers the kingside, and keeps the queen active.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nQe6\n```"
