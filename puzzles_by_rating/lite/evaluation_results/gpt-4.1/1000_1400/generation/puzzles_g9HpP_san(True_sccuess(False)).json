When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White must address the mate threat immediately.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rf3 defends h3 and blocks the mate.\n- Nf3 also defends h2.\n- Rf2 defends h2.\n- Ng2 defends h2.\n- Bf3 blocks the h-file and attacks the queen.\n- Qd3 defends h3 and attacks the queen.\n- Qd2 defends h2.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. **Rf3**: Defends h3, but Black can play Qg4, keeping pressure.\n2. **Nf3**: Defends h2, but the knight is pinned to the king by the bishop on d6.\n3. **Rf2**: Defends h2, but blocks the knight on e1 and is passive.\n4. **Ng2**: Defends h2, but blocks the g-pawn and is passive.\n5. **Bf3**: Attacks the queen and blocks the h-file. If ...Qf5, White can play Qd3, defending f5 and h3.\n6. **Qd3**: Defends h3, but Black can play Qxd3, cxd3, and White loses the queen for a bishop.\n7. **Qd2**: Defends h2, but is passive.\n\nOf these, **Bf3** is the most active and blocks the mate threat while attacking the queen. If Black plays ...Qf5, White can play Qd3, defending f5 and h3.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nBf3\n```"
