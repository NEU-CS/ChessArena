If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Rxg8+ Kxg8\n2. Rxa7\n\nWhite will be up two pawns in a rook endgame, with active rooks and a safer king.\n\nAre there any better options?\n- Rhh7 is not a threat.\n- Rxh6 wins a pawn, but Rxg8+ is stronger, as it forces the king to move and wins a pawn anyway.\n- Rc8 is interesting, but after ...Re1+ White's king is exposed.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRxg8+\n```"
