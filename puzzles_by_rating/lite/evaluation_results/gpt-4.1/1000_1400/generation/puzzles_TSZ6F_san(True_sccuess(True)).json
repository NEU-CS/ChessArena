Legal move:** Kh1\n\nLet's break down the position:\n\n- **Material:** White is down a queen for a rook and a pawn.\n- **King safety:** White's king is on g1, Black's king is on b8.\n- **Threats:** Black's queen on f2 is threatening mate on f1, but the only legal move for White is Kh1, which avoids immediate mate.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The only legal move is Kh1. All other moves would leave the king in check or are not possible.\n\nTherefore, the move is:\n```\nKh1\n```"
