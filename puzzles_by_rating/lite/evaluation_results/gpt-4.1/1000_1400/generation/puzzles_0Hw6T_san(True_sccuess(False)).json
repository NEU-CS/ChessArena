If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

        "content": "Let's analyze the position:\n\n- Black to move.\n- Material: Black is up a bishop for a pawn.\n- White's king is on g5, somewhat exposed, but not immediately threatened.\n- Black's bishop on d7 is active, and Black has a passed a-pawn.\n- White's pawns are advanced but somewhat blockaded.\n- Black's bishop on g3 is very strong, eyeing the h4 pawn and f2 square.\n- White's bishop on e2 is passive.\n- Black's king is on d7, relatively safe.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **Bxh4+**: This checks the king and wins a pawn. White's king must move, and Black can follow up with Be1 or Be8, keeping the bishop active.\n2. **Bf4+**: Also a check, but White can play Kxf4, and then Black loses the bishop.\n3. **Be8**: Retreats the bishop, but not active.\n4. **Bxe5**: Captures a pawn, but after Kxe5, White's king becomes more active.\n5. **a5**: Pushes the passed pawn, but immediate tactics seem more promising.\n6. **Bh2**: Attacks the e5 pawn, but not as forcing as Bxh4+.\n7. **Be1**: Attacks the bishop, but not as forcing.\n\n**Calculation of Bxh4+:**\n- 1...Bxh4+ 2. Kxh4 (forced)\n- Now, Black can play a5, pushing the passed pawn, or Be1, attacking the bishop.\n- White's king is far from the queenside, so Black's a-pawn can be very dangerous.\n\n**Calculation of Bxe5:**\n- 1...Bxe5 2. Kxe5, White's king becomes very active, threatening to invade.\n\n**Calculation of a5:**\n- 1...a5, White can try h5, but Black's bishop is still very strong.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe move **Bxh4+** wins a pawn with check, keeps the initiative, and leaves White's king far from the queenside, where Black's a-pawn can become a decisive factor.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nBxh4+\n```"
