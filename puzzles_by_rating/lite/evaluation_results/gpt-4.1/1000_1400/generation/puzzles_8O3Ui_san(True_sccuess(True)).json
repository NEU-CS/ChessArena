Qxg4: Win a piece.\n2. Bxc6: Exchange and then win the knight.\n3. O-O: Castle and keep the attack going.\n4. hxg4: Immediate recapture, but loses the queen.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Qxg4 Qxg4 hxg4, White is up a piece.\n- If Black tries e5 after Qxg4, then Bxe5, White is still up a piece.\n- No immediate counterplay for Black.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to take the knight with the queen.\n\n```\nQxg4\n```"

White simply wins the queen.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **hxg4** \u2014 wins the queen for a pawn.\n2. **Bxc6+** \u2014 check, but after bxc6, hxg4 still wins the queen.\n3. **Other moves** \u2014 less forcing.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- hxg4: White wins the queen. Black has no immediate compensation.\n- Bxc6+ bxc6 hxg4: White wins the queen, but Black gets the bishop pair and opens the b-file. Still, White is up a queen for a bishop and a pawn.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the queen immediately.\n\n```\nhxg4\n```"
