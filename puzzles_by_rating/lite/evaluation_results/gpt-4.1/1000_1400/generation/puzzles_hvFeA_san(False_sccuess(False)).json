When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has two rooks and a queen in the attack.**\n\n**Legal moves:**\n- h1g1 (King to g1)\n- e7e4 (Rook e7 to e4)\n- h3g2 (Queen h3 to g2)\n\n**Candidate move analysis:**\n\n1. **e7e4** (Rook e7 to e4):\n   - Attacks the Black queen on d5.\n   - If Black exchanges queens (d5xe4), White can recapture with the rook (Rxe4), maintaining pressure and material advantage.\n   - If Black moves the queen, White can double rooks on the seventh rank or increase pressure.\n\n2. **h3g2** (Queen h3 to g2):\n   - Retreats the queen, possibly to avoid tactics, but loses attacking potential.\n\n3. **h1g1** (King h1 to g1):\n   - Moves the king to a slightly safer square, but doesn't change the position significantly.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- Black's king is very boxed in.\n- White's rooks and queen are well placed for an attack.\n- e7e4 is an active move, attacking the queen and possibly opening the e-file for more pressure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is **e7e4**, attacking the Black queen and keeping the initiative.\n\n```\ne7e4\n```"
