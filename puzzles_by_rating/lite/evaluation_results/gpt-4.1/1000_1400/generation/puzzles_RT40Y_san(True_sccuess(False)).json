If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If Kf5, then Rf7+ is possible. If Ke3, then Re1+ is strong.\n2. **Re1+**: Immediate check, but White can block with Re2 or Be2.\n3. **Rf4+**: Check, but White can play Kd5 or Ke3.\n4. **Rxa1**: Captures the bishop, but allows White to play h6 or Rxb6.\n5. **Raf7**: Doubling rooks, but not forcing.\n6. **h5**: Pushes the pawn, but not urgent.\n\n**Deep analysis:**\n- **Nc3+**: \n    - If Kf5, then Rf7+ wins the rook on g6.\n    - If Ke3, then Re1+ is very strong, threatening mate and picking up material.\n    - If Kd3, then Rd7+ is possible.\n- **Rxa1**: \n    - White can play h6, threatening mate ideas, but Black can defend.\n- **Re1+**: \n    - White blocks with Re2 or Be2, not as forcing as Nc3+.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Nc3+** is the most forcing move, and after Kf5 Rf7+ wins the rook, or after Ke3 Re1+ is crushing.\n\nMy move:\n```\nNc3+\n```"
