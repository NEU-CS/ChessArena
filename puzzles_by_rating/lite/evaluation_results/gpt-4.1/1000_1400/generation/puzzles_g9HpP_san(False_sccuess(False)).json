When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Nf3 (block the mate, but not legal in the list)\n2. Rf2 (defend h2, but not legal in the list)\n3. Bf3 (block the mate, not legal in the list)\n4. Qd3 (defend h3, not legal in the list)\n5. Bf3 (move bishop to f3, legal: e2f3)\n6. g1f2 (move king to f2, legal)\n7. f1f2 (move rook to f2, legal)\n8. f1f3 (move rook to f3, legal)\n\nFrom the legal moves, **e2f3** (Bf3) is the only one that directly blocks the mate threat on h2.\n\n**Check for tactics:**\n- e2f3 blocks the mate, but does Black have any way to exploit this? After e2f3, if Black captures Bxf4, White can recapture with the queen or rook.\n- If White plays f1f3, Black can play Qg4, threatening mate again.\n- If White plays g1f2, Black can play Qh2+ and after Kf3, Qg3# is mate.\n- f1f2 is similar, but after Qg4, White is still in trouble.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**e2f3** is the best move, blocking the mate and defending h1.\n\nFinal move:\n```\ne2f3\n```"
