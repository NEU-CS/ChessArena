If K moves, White wins the rook on d1. If Rxf1, White plays Kxf1, and White is up a full rook.\n- **c8h8**: Threatens mate, but Black can play Kg6 or Ng6.\n\nLet's check **e5f7**:\n1. Nxf7 (fork)\n   - Kg6 (only move)\n   - Nxd8, White wins the rook.\n\nAlternatively, if Black plays Rxf1+:\n1. Nxf7 Rxf1+\n2. Kxf1, White is up a full rook.\n\n**Conclusion:** The move **e5f7** wins material by forking king and rook.\n\nFinal move:\n```\ne5f7\n```"
