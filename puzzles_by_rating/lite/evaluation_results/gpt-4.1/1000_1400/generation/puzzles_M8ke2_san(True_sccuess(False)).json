When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Qe8: Threatens Qxf8+, but Black can respond with Rxe8, and after Qxe8+ Qg8, White has no immediate win.\n2. Qxa4: Wins a pawn, but does not create an immediate threat.\n3. fxe6: Opens the f-file, threatens f6, and if Black recaptures, White can play Be5+.\n4. Qxc8: Wins a bishop, but loses the queen after Rxc8.\n5. Qxe6: Wins a pawn, but Black can respond with Bxe6.\n6. f6: Threatens fxg7+, but Black can play Qxf6.\n\n**Deeper Calculation:**\n\n- Qe8 Rxe8 Qxe8+ Qg8 Qxg8+ Kxg8: White is up a rook for a queen, but Black has two connected passed pawns on the queenside. Not clearly winning for White.\n- fxe6: If ...Qf6, then Be5 wins the queen. If ...Bxe6, then Qxe6 wins a piece.\n- f6: If ...Qxf6, then Be5 wins the queen. If ...Qh6, then Be5 is still strong.\n\n**Best Move:**\n\nLet's check f6:\n\n- f6 Qxf6 Be5 wins the queen.\n- f6 Qg8, then f7 threatens fxg8=Q+.\n\nSo, f6 is a very strong move, threatening f7 and also Be5.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nf6\n```"
