If ...Qxg7, then hxg7+ and White will promote. If ...Ke8, then Qxh8+.\n2. **Nf7**: Forks queen and rook, but after Qxf7, White loses the knight.\n3. **Nd7+**: Check, but after Nxd7, White loses the knight.\n4. **Ng6+**: Check, but after hxg6, White loses the knight.\n5. **Rh4**: Threatens to swing the rook to g4 or h3 for attack.\n6. **Be8**: Attacks the queen, but not forcing.\n7. **Rd3**: Defends c2 and prepares to double rooks.\n\n**Deep calculation for Qxg7+:**\n- 1. Qxg7+ Qxg7 (forced, otherwise hxg7+ and White queens)\n- 2. hxg7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n- 3. h6+ (White has no pawn on h6, so not possible)\n- 3. Rdg1+ Kf8 (if ...Kf8, then Nd7+ wins the queen)\n- 3. Nd7+ Kf7 (if ...Nxd7, then Bxd7)\n- But after Qxg7+ Qxg7, hxg7+ Kxg7, White has lost the queen for two pawns.\n\n**Alternative:**\n- 1. Qxg7+ Qxg7\n- 2. hxg7+ Kxg7\n- 3. h6+ Kg8 (if ...Kg8, then Rdg1, threatening mate)\n- 4. Rdg1 (threatening h7#)\n- Black must play ...Ne8 to cover h7, but then White can play Bxe8, and after ...Rxe8, White can play Nd7, threatening Nf6+.\n\nBut let's check if Qxg7+ is really winning.\n\n**Let's check the line:**\n1. Qxg7+ Qxg7\n2. hxg7+ Kxg7\n3. h6+ Kg8\n4. Rdg1 (threatening h7#)\n5. ...Ne8 (only move)\n6. Bxe8 Rxe8\n7. Nd7 (threatening Nf6+)\n8. ...Re7 (only move)\n9. Nxf6+ Kf7\n10. Nxh7\n\nWhite is up material and has a winning attack.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nQxg7+ is a forced sequence that leads to a decisive attack for White.\n\nMy move:\n```\nQxg7+\n```"
