When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is active, and the rook is centralized. Black's rook is on e3, potentially threatening to become active.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. d6d7: Rook to the 7th rank, attacking g7 and threatening to invade.\n2. d6d8: Rook to the 8th, but not threatening anything immediate.\n3. d6g6: Rook attacks g6 pawn, but Black can defend with ...Re7.\n4. d6f6: Rook attacks f5 square, not very effective.\n5. h4h5: Pawn push, but Black can respond with ...g5+.\n6. f4f5: Pawn push, but Black can play ...gxf5.\n7. a3a4: Pawn push, but not urgent.\n\nThe most promising move is d6d7, putting pressure on g7 and threatening to invade the 7th rank. If Black plays ...Kf8, White can double up with Rd6-d8 and threaten mate or win material. If Black plays ...Kf6, White can play Rd6-d6 and keep the rook active.\n\nLet's check for any tactics:\n- After d6d7, if Black plays ...Kf6, White can play g5+ and after hxg5+, hxg5# is mate.\n- If Black plays ...Kg8, White can play Rd6-d8+ and after Kf7, Rd7 wins the rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd6d7\n```"
