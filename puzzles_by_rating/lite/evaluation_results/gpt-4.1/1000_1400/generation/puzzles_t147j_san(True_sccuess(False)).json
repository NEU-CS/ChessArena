When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black has a dangerous passed pawn on g3, but White's king is safe and White's rook is very active.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rxf7: Captures the rook, but after ...g2, Black threatens to promote. White can play Rxg7+ and then f5, but the g-pawn is dangerous.\n- Rd8: Pins the bishop, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.\n- Re7: Shifts the rook, but not as strong as capturing.\n- f5: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't address the g-pawn.\n- Kc1: King move, not urgent.\n- c3, b3, a3, c4, b4, a4: Pawn moves, not urgent.\n\nLet's calculate Rxf7:\n1. Rxf7 g2\n2. Rxg7+ Kxg7\n3. f5\n\nNow, Black's only hope is to push the b-pawn or a-pawn, but White's king can help stop them, and White has a passed f-pawn. White is winning.\n\nAlternatively, if White doesn't take the rook, Black can play ...g2 next move, so White must act now.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRxf7\n```"
