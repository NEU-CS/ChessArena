When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

After Kg4, White can continue to harass the king or bring the king closer.\n\nLet's check d6f6+:\n1. d6f6+ Kg4 (forced)\n2. Re6 (attacking the knight and threatening Re4+)\nBut after Kg4, White can also consider h3+ ideas, but that's not available.\n\nAlternatively, d6d5+:\n1. d6d5+ Kxe4 (if king takes, rook can check again)\nBut then the king is centralized.\n\nAlternatively, d6d4: Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, d6d8: Not threatening.\n\nAlternatively, d6d7: Not threatening.\n\nAlternatively, d6e6: Attacks the knight, but the knight is defended by the king.\n\nSo, d6f6+ is the most forcing move, driving the king further away and keeping the initiative.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd6f6\n```"
