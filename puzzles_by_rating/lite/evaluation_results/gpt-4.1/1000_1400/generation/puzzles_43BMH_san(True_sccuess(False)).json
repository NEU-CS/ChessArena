If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Are there tactics for White?\n2. **Qe5**: Retreats the queen, keeps pressure, but loses activity.\n3. **Qd8/Qd6**: Retreats queen, but loses initiative.\n4. **Bxc3**: Removes knight, but after bxc3, White has bishop pair and open b-file.\n5. **Nd7**: Develops knight, but blocks bishop.\n6. **c5**: Gains space, but weakens d6.\n7. **a6**: Prevents Nb5, but slow.\n8. **Bd7**: Develops bishop, prepares to castle.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- Is White threatening anything immediate? Nb5 is a threat, but not decisive.\n- If O-O, is there a tactic? After O-O, White can play Nb5, but after Qd8, Black is fine.\n- If Bxc3, bxc3, Qxc3, White can play Rc1, attacking the queen, but after Qe5, Black is safe.\n\n**Best move:**\n- Castling kingside (O-O) is safe and develops the rook, gets the king out of the center, and keeps options open. There are no immediate tactics for White that punish this.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nO-O\n```"
