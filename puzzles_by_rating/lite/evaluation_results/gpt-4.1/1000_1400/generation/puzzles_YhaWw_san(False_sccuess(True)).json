When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:** a6a7, a6a5, b7b6\n\n**Material:**\n- Black: King on a6, Rook on b7, Pawn on b5, Pawn on a4, Queen on e2\n- White: King on h1, Rook on b1, Queen on c6, Pawn on h3, Pawn on g2\n\n**Position:**\n- Black is up a queen and rook for a queen and rook, but White's queen is very active and close to the Black king.\n- Black's king is on a6, a bit exposed, but White has no immediate checks.\n- Black's queen is on e2, attacking g2 and h3 (potential mating net).\n- White's king is on h1, very boxed in, with only the h3 pawn and g2 pawn as cover.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. a6a7: King to a7. This doesn't do much, just moves the king.\n2. a6a5: King to a5. This puts the king on the edge, but doesn't seem to help.\n3. b7b6: Rook to b6. This blocks the c6 queen's access to the 6th rank, and also potentially threatens to play ...Qe1+ and mate on g1.\n\n**Tactical ideas:**\n- If Black plays b7b6, then Qc6xb6+ is possible, but then Qe2b5 is mate (since the king is on a6 and the rook is on b6).\n- Let's check: 1... b7b6 2. Qc6xb6+ Qxb6 (forced) 3. Rxb6+ Kxb6, and Black is up a queen and a pawn for a rook, which is winning.\n- Alternatively, after b7b6, if White does not take, Black threatens Qe1+ and Qxb1, or Qe1+ and Qg1# if the rook moves.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- 1... b7b6 2. Qc6xb6+ Qxb6 3. Rxb6+ Kxb6, and Black is completely winning.\n- 1... b7b6 2. Qc6e4 (trying to defend), then Qxe4, and Black is up a queen.\n- 1... b7b6 2. Qc6c1 (trying to defend the back rank), then Qe1+ 3. Qxe1 Rxe1+ 4. Kh2 Rxb1, and Black is up a rook and a pawn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move b7b6 is the best, as it forces a queen trade or wins material, and White has no perpetual or counterplay.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nb7b6\n```"
