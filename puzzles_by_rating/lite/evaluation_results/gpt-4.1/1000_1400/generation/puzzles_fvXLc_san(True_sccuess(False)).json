Qxe7 (capture the knight)\n2. Qh6/Qg6/Qf6 (move the queen to a safe square)\n3. Rb8 (develop rook, but doesn't address the threat)\n4. Nf6 (develop knight, but doesn't address the threat)\n5. Re8 (defend e7, but not useful)\n6. Rd8 (defend d7, but not useful)\n7. Nb6 (move knight, but doesn't address the threat)\n8. Bb7 (develop bishop, but doesn't address the threat)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Qxe7:** This is the most forcing move. If Black plays Qxe7, White can play Qxe7, then Nf6, and White's queen is on e7, but Black can try to develop and defend.\n- **Qh6/Qg6/Qf6:** Retreating the queen, but then White can play Nxc8, forking the rook and bishop, winning material.\n- **Qxe7** is the only move that doesn't lose material immediately.\n\nLet's check Qxe7:\n\n1. ... Qxe7\n2. Qxe7 Nf6 (attacking the queen)\n3. Qxc7 (White grabs a pawn and attacks the rook on a8)\n4. ... Re8+ (check)\n5. Kf2 (or Kd1) (if Kd1, then Black can play Bg4+)\n\nBut after Qxe7, White's queen is very active, but Black is not losing material immediately.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to capture the knight with the queen.\n\n```\nQxe7\n```"
