You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

If White plays Qxf4, then Nf2 forks king and queen. If White plays Kb1, then Qxf3 wins the queen.\n2. **Ne3**: Attacks the queen and threatens Qxf4+ next.\n3. **f5**: Kicks the knight, but White can play Qxa8.\n4. **Nh2**: Attacks the rook, but not as forcing.\n5. **Qh4**: Threatens mate on e1, but White can defend.\n6. **Qe5**: Centralizes the queen, but less forcing.\n\n**Calculating Qxf4+:**\n- 26... Qxf4+ 27. Qxf4 (forced, otherwise White loses the queen) Nf2 (forks king and queen)\n- 28. Qxf2 Nxf2, Black wins the queen for a knight and is up material.\n\nAlternatively, after 26... Qxf4+ 27. Kb1 (avoiding the queen trade), then 27... Qxf3, Black wins the queen outright.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe move 26... Qxf4+ wins material by force, either the queen or a decisive fork.\n\nMy move:\n```\nQxf4+\n```"
