When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If Kd1, then Qxc3, and Black wins a piece.\n2. **Qa3**: Threatening mate on c3, but White can defend.\n3. **Nxf3**: Captures a pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n4. **Qxc3**: Captures a piece, but the rook on b2 is hanging.\n5. **Nd7**: Retreats, but passive.\n6. **Qd8**: Defends, but passive.\n\n**Calculation of Rxc2+:**\n- 1... Rxc2+ 2. Bxc2 (forced, otherwise Kd1 Qxc3 wins a piece)\n- 2... Qxc3 3. Rac1 (defends c2) Qxf3+ 4. Kd2 Qxf8\n\nBut after 1... Rxc2+ 2. Bxc2 Qxc3 3. Rac1, Black has won a piece for a rook, but White's king is still exposed.\n\nAlternatively, after 1... Rxc2+ 2. Bxc2 Qxc3 3. Rac1 Qxf3+ 4. Kd2 Qxf8, Black is up material.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n- 1... Rxc2+ is the most forcing and seems to win material.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\nRxc2+\n```"
