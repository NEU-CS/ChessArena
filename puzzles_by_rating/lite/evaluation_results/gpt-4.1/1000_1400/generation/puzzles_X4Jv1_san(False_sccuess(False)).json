When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed, but White's king is also exposed.**\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- h1e4 (Queen captures rook with check)\n- f8f5 (Rook blocks check and attacks queen)\n- h1h5 (Queen check)\n- f8h8 (Rook to h8, defending h5)\n- h1c1 (Queen to c1, attacking c5 pawn and threatening c4 check)\n- g6h5 (Pawn captures queen)\n\n**Key tactical point:** White's queen is on h4, and Black can play g6xh5, capturing the queen. But is this safe? Let's check:\n\n1. g6xh5\n   - White can play Rh4, but that's not check.\n   - White can play Qxh5+, but after Kg8, there is no immediate mate.\n   - White's queen is hanging, so capturing it is strong.\n\n**Let's check for any immediate mates for White if we take the queen:**\n\n1. ... g6xh5\n2. Kxh5 (if White recaptures)\n   - Black can play f8g8, threatening mate on g4.\n   - White has no immediate checks.\n\nAlternatively, if Black plays h1e4, capturing the rook with check:\n\n1. ... Qxe4\n2. dxe4 (pawn recaptures)\n   - Black is up material, but White's king is still exposed.\n\nBut g6xh5 simply wins the queen for a pawn, which is decisive.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng6h5\n```"
