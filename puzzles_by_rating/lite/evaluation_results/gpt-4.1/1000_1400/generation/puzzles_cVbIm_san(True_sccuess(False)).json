If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

If 36.Kh4, then ...Rg4+ is possible, harassing the king further.\n2. **Re7**: Centralizing the rook, but less active than a check.\n3. **h4+**: Pawn check, but after Kxh4, Black loses the h-pawn for nothing.\n4. **d3**: Advancing the passed pawn, but White can blockade with c2-c3.\n5. **a6, b5, a5**: Pawn moves on the queenside, but not urgent.\n6. **Kg7, Kg6**: King moves, but not improving the position.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Rg7+** is the most forcing move. Let's see the lines:\n    - 36.Kh3 (or h4): Black can play ...Rg4, threatening ...Rxf4 and keeping the White king boxed in.\n    - 36.Kf3: Black can play ...h4, and if gxh4, then ...Rg3+ wins the rook on e2.\n    - 36.Kf2: Black can play ...h4, again threatening ...Rg3.\n\n- **h4+** is not good because after Kxh4, Black loses the h-pawn.\n\n- **d3** is interesting, but White can play c2-c3 and blockade.\n\n- **Re7** is passive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**Rg7+** is the most active and forcing move, putting pressure on the White king and keeping the initiative.\n\nMy move:\n```\nRg7+\n```"
