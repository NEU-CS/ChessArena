When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The queenside pawns are blockaded for now. The best chance is to use the king to attack Black's pawns, then return to support the queenside pawns.\n\n**Let's check e4f5:**\n1. e4f5 g3 (if f3, then Kxg4, and White is winning)\n2. Kxg4, and White can start mopping up pawns.\n\nAlternatively, after e4f5, if Black does nothing, White can play Kxg4, then Kxh4, and then return to support the queenside pawns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to play e4f5, attacking Black's pawns and creating a winning plan.\n\nMy move:\n```\ne4f5\n```"
