When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:**  \n- g8h8 (Kg8-h8)\n- g8h7 (Kg8-h7)\n- f8f7 (Rf8-f7)\n\n**Position assessment:**\n- Black is down significant material (White has a queen, Black only a rook and king).\n- White's queen is very active on e6, threatening multiple checks and possible mates.\n- White's bishop on e5 is also very strong, controlling key diagonals.\n- Black's king is on g8, rook on f8, queen on a8.\n- White's king is on g2, relatively safe for now.\n- Black's only legal moves are with the king and rook.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **g8h8 (Kg8-h8):** Moves the king to the corner. However, this allows Qxh6+ with a devastating attack, as the king is now on the h-file and the rook is pinned.\n2. **g8h7 (Kg8-h7):** Moves the king to h7. After Qg6+, the king is forced to h8, and White can continue the attack.\n3. **f8f7 (Rf8-f7):** Moves the rook to f7, blocking the queen's access to the 7th rank and possibly preparing to defend along the 7th rank.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- After **f8f7**, if White plays Qg6+, Black can play Rg7, blocking the check. If White plays Qxf7+, Black must recapture with the king, but then White can play Bxc3, winning more material.\n- After **g8h8**, White plays Qxh6+ Kg8 (forced), Qg7# (mate).\n- After **g8h7**, White plays Qg6+ Kh8, Qxh6+ Kg8, Qg7# (mate).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Both king moves (g8h8 and g8h7) lead to immediate mate.\n- The only move that avoids immediate mate is **f8f7**.\n\nTherefore, the best (and only) move is:\n```\nf8f7\n```"
