When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...Rxd8, then Nxd8, but that doesn't seem to lead to a quick win.\n2. **Qd5-a8**: Attacks the queen on b8 and threatens mate on g7 if the bishop moves.\n3. **Qd5-g5**: Attacks the bishop on h6 and threatens Qxg6.\n4. **Ne6xf8**: Captures the rook on f8 with check. If ...Qxf8, then Qxf3, but that loses the knight.\n5. **Qd5-d7**: Attacks the rook on f3 and threatens Qxg7# if the bishop moves.\n6. **Qd5-e4**: Attacks the rook on f3 and threatens Qxg6.\n\n**Tactical calculation:**\n- **Ne6xf8+**: After ...Qxf8, White can play Qxf3, but then Black has ...Qxf3+, and White's king is exposed.\n- **Qd5-d8+**: After ...Rxd8, Nxd8, White is up material, but Black still has threats.\n- **Qd5-g5**: Threatens Qxg6, but Black can play ...Bxg5.\n- **Qd5-d7**: Attacks the rook on f3 and threatens Qxg7# if the bishop moves.\n\n**Best move:**\nAfter careful analysis, the move **Qd5-d7** stands out. It attacks the rook on f3, keeps pressure on g7, and maintains the threat of Qxg7#. Black cannot easily defend all threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd5d7\n```"
