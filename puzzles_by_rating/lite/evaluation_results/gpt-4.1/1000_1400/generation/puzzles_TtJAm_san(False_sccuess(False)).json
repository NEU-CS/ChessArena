When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a queenside pawn majority, but White is up the exchange (White has two rooks vs. rook and knight for Black).\n\nWhite's plan:\n- Activate rooks, possibly double on the e-file or invade the 7th rank.\n- Consider pushing pawns to create weaknesses or open lines.\n- Avoid allowing Black's knight to become too active or Black's rook to invade.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e2e4: Attacks the knight, but after dxe4, White's pawn structure is compromised.\n2. e2e3: Prepares to double rooks or defend the third rank.\n3. e2d2: Doubles rooks on the d-file, but not immediately threatening.\n4. f1g1 or f1e1: King safety, but not urgent.\n5. a3a4: Fixes Black's queenside pawns, but may not be urgent.\n6. f2f3: Attacks the knight, but weakens the king.\n7. g2g3: Prepares to fianchetto or support f4.\n8. e2e1: Retreat, not useful.\n\nThe most active plan is to double rooks or prepare to invade the 7th rank. However, e2e4 is also tempting to challenge the knight, but after dxe4, Black's rook becomes more active.\n\nI prefer to double rooks on the e-file, as Black's king is on g8 and the e-file is open. So, a logical move is a1e1.\n\nTherefore, my move is:\n```\na1e1\n```"
