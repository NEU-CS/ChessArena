When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

If ...Kxh8, then Nxf7+ forks king and rook. If ...Kg6, White can continue the attack.\n2. **Nxf7**: Forks king and rook, but after ...Ne2+ and Kh1, Black can take the rook on c8.\n3. **Nd7**: Attacks b6 and f8, but not as forcing.\n4. **Other rook moves**: Not as forcing as Rh8+.\n\nLet's calculate **Rh8+**:\n- 1. Rh8+ Kxh8 (forced)\n- 2. Nxf7+ Kg8 (forced)\n- 3. Nxd8\n\nBut after 1...Kg6, White can play Nxf7, and after ...Kxf7, Rc7+ picks up the knight on f4.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Rh8+ Kxh8 2. Nxf7+ Kg8 3. Nxd8, White wins the exchange and remains up material.\n\nTherefore, **Rh8+** is a strong move, forcing Black to give up material or get mated.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nRh8+\n```"
