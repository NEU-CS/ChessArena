When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The queen on c6 is very active, and the bishop on h3 eyes the g4 square.\n- Black's queen on g7 and rook on f8 are defending, but the back rank is weak.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. **c6e8**: Queen to e8, threatening Qxf8+ and possibly Qg6.\n2. **e1e6**: Rook to e6, attacking the queen and pawn on g6.\n3. **f5e6**: Pawn takes e6, opening lines and attacking the queen.\n4. **h3g4**: Bishop to g4, attacking the queen and threatening f6.\n5. **g3g4**: Pawn to g4, attacking the queen and opening lines.\n\n**Tactical Considerations:**\n- **c6e8**: If Qe8, Black must respond. If Rxe8, then Rxe8+ is mate. If Qg8, then Qxf8 is mate.\n- **f5e6**: Pawn takes e6, if Qf6, then Qxf6+ Rxf6, Rf1 wins.\n- **e1e6**: Rook attacks the queen, but Black can play Qf7 or Qg8.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **c6e8**: \n    - If ...Rxe8, then Qxe8+ Qg8, Qxg8+ Kxg8, f6 wins.\n    - If ...Qg8, then Qxf8 Rxf8, f6 wins.\n    - If ...Qf7, then Qxf7 Rxf7, fxe6 wins.\n\n- **f5e6**: \n    - If ...Qf6, then Qxf6+ Rxf6, Rf1 wins.\n    - If ...Qh6, then Qxa4.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **c6e8** is a direct threat, and Black cannot defend both f8 and g8. It threatens Qxf8# and forces Black to give up material or get mated.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc6e8\n```"
