If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Qe8+ (forcing the king to c7, then Qxc6+)\n2. Qxd7+ (winning a bishop, but losing pressure)\n3. Qxc6+ (winning a bishop, but after bxc6, less pressure)\n4. Rxf6 (removes a defender, but after Qe1+ Kh2, Qe5+ is not dangerous)\n5. Bg7 (threatening mate on f8, but not immediate)\n6. Qg8 (threatening mate, but Black can defend)\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Qe8+ Kc7 Qxc6+ bxc6 Bxc6 (threatening mate with Rf8, and Black's king is exposed)\n- After Qe8+ Kc7 Qxc6+ bxc6 Bxc6, White is up a full rook and has a crushing attack.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to start with the forcing check:\n\n```\nQe8+\n```"
