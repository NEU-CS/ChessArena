If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

If Kf6, then Qh6+ is mate.\n- fxe4 attacks the rook, but White can respond with dxe4.\n- gxh5 opens the g-file, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n\nLet's check Qc1+:\n\n1. ... Qc1+\n   - If Kf6, then Qh6+ is mate (the king is trapped by its own pieces).\n   - If Kf4, then Qe3# is mate (the king is trapped).\n\nSo, Qc1+ is a forced mate in one or two.\n\nLet's check the lines:\n\n1. ... Qc1+\n   - Kf6 Qh6# (mate)\n   - Kf4 Qe3# (mate)\n\nTherefore, Qc1+ is a forced mate in two.\n\nThe best move is:\n```\nQc1+\n```"
