If Kg3, then Rd3+ repeats.\n- **Rxd7**: If Rxe6, then Nxe6, but White's knight is active.\n- **Nf4**: Threatens mate on g2, but White can defend.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Rd2+** is very forcing and keeps the initiative. After Kh1, Black can continue with Rd1+ and keep checking, or after Kg3, Rd3+ repeats. This keeps White's king exposed and allows Black to probe for more.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nRd2+\n```"
