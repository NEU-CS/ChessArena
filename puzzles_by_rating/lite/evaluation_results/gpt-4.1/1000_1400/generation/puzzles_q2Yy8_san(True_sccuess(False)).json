If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Let's see what happens:\n    - 1. Ne7+ Qxe7 (if ...Kf8, then Nxg6+ wins the queen)\n    - 1. Ne7+ Kf8 2. Nxg6+ fxg6 3. Qxg6 and White is winning.\n\n- The move Qxg6+ is also a check, but after ...fxg6, White doesn't have a follow-up check.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n- Ne7+ (forcing, check)\n- Qxg6+ (check, but less forcing)\n- Nxb8 (wins a bishop, but less forcing than Ne7+)\n- Other moves are less forcing.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. Ne7+ Kf8 (if ...Kh7, then Qxg6+ fxg6 Nxg6# is mate)\n    - 2. Nxg6+ fxg6 3. Qxg6 and Black is in trouble (threatening Qxh6, mate threats)\n    - If ...Ke8, then Qg8# is mate.\n\nLet's check for mate:\n1. Ne7+ Kf8 2. Nxg6+ fxg6 3. Qxg6 Qh2+ 4. Kf1 Qh1#? No, Black can't mate.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Ne7+ Kf8 2. Nxg6+ fxg6 3. Qxg6 Qh2+ 4. Kf1 Qh1+ 5. Qg1 Qxg1+ 6. Kxg1, White is up a piece and has a winning endgame.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is the forcing check:\n\n```\nNe7+\n```"
