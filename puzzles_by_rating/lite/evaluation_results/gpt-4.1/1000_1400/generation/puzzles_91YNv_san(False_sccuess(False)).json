When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is centralized and can try to support the h-pawn or create counterplay on the queenside.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- h3h2: Pushes the h-pawn, one step from queening. White's king is not close enough to stop it immediately.\n- d5e6/d5d6: King moves, but don't immediately support the h-pawn.\n- d5c4: Approaches the queenside pawns, but White's king is closer to the kingside.\n- d5e5: Centralizes, but doesn't help the h-pawn.\n- d5c5: Similar.\n- d5d4: Approaches the queenside, but White's king can support f3-f4-f5.\n\nIf h3h2, White's only way to stop h1=Q is to play Kg2, but that allows Black to play Kd4 and support the h-pawn's promotion.\n\nLet's check:\n1. ... h3h2\n2. Kg2 (only move to stop h1=Q)\n3. Kd4 (threatening h1=Q)\n4. Kxh2 (forced)\n5. Ke3 (Black's king invades, and Black can try to win the f3 pawn and support the a-pawn)\n\nAlternatively, after h3h2, if White ignores and pushes f4, Black queens.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to push the h-pawn:\n\n```\nh3h2\n```"
