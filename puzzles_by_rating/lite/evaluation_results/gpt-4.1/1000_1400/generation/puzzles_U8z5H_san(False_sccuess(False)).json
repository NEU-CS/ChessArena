When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Rxb7, White can play Bxc6+, winning the exchange. If Black ignores, White can take on b8 next.\n- **g2c6**: Bishop takes pawn, attacks rook and queen. If Qd7, Bxd7+ Kxd7, White wins the exchange and has a strong position.\n- **f4e5**: Bishop attacks queen, but Black can play Qa5+ or Qd7, defending.\n- **e1g1**: Castling is safe, but not urgent since White has initiative.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **g2c6** is very strong: Bishop takes pawn, attacks rook and queen, and threatens Bxc6+ if Black recaptures on b7. This wins material and keeps initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng2c6\n```"
