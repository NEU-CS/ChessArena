You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

If White plays Rc2, then Qc4 attacks a2 and supports c3. If White plays Qd7, then Qxd7 Rxd7, and Black can play c2, threatening to queen.\n\n**Best move:**\nAfter careful consideration, **Rb2** is the most active and dangerous move, threatening to invade the second rank and putting pressure on f2 and c2.\n\n```\nRb2\n```"
