If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

So Black must prevent this.\n\n**Defensive move:**\n- h6: If h6, then Qxg6, and White threatens Qh5+ and Qf7. Not good.\n- Bf6: If Bf6, then Nxg6+ hxg6 Qxf6 is devastating.\n- Rg8: If Rg8, then Nxg6+ hxg6 Qh4+ Bh6 Qxh6# (mate).\n- Qc7: If Qc7, then Nxg6+ hxg6 Qh4+ Bh6 Qxh6# (mate).\n- Qb5: If Qb5, then Nxg6+ hxg6 Qh4+ Bh6 Qxh6# (mate).\n- Qxe3+: If Qxe3+, White can play Qxe3 Bxe3+ Kh1, and Black is down a queen.\n\n**Only move to survive:**\n- Qxd5: If Qxd5, then Nxg6+ hxg6 Qxd5, White wins a piece and Black is lost.\n- dxe2: If dxe2, White can play Nxg6+ hxg6 Qh4+ Bh6 Qxh6# (mate).\n\n**Is there any way to defend against Nxg6+?**\n- The only way to stop Nxg6+ is to move the queen to g6 or f6, but those squares are not available.\n\n**Is there a way to create a counter-threat?**\n- d2: If d2, White can still play Nxg6+ hxg6 Qh4+ Bh6 Qxh6# (mate).\n\n**Is there a way to give a perpetual or force a draw?**\n- Qxe3+ is the only check, but after Qxe3 Bxe3+ Kh1, Black is lost.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBlack is in a losing position, but the only way to avoid immediate mate is to give a check and hope for a blunder.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nQxe3+\n```"
