When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxc6: Captures a bishop, threatens mate, and keeps up the pressure.\n2. Qe8+: Forces Rh8, but no immediate follow-up.\n3. Bxc6: Captures with bishop, but queen is more powerful.\n4. Rf6: Threatens to double on the 6th rank, but not as forcing.\n5. Qg8+: Not possible due to knight.\n6. Qe7: Threatens mate on e8, but can be blocked.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- After Qxc6+, if Black plays bxc6, then Bxc6 is mate (since the king is boxed in).\n- If Qxc6, Black cannot recapture with b7 pawn because it's pinned by the rook on f4.\n- After Qxc6, Black's only move is Kd8, but then Qc7# is mate.\n\nLet's check:\n1. Qxc6+ bxc6 (illegal, pawn is pinned)\n2. Qxc6+ Kd8\n   - Qc7# is mate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move Qxc6+ is crushing and leads to forced mate.\n\nMy move is:\n```\ne6c6\n```"
