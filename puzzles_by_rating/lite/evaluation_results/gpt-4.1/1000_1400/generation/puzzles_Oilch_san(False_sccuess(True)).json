Legal moves:** g1h2, g2h3\n\n- White's king is on h1, rook on f1, bishop on c1, knight on c3, rook on a1, pawns on d4, g2, a2.\n- Black's king is on f7, queen on d6, rook on c2, bishop on b8, knight on d7, pawns on a7, b7, d5, f6, g6, h3.\n\n**White's only legal moves:** g1h2 (move the rook from g1 to h2), g2h3 (pawn from g2 to h3).\n\nLet's check the consequences of both moves:\n\n### 1. g1h2 (Rook to h2)\n- This move puts the rook on h2, but Black can play Qxh2+ and after Kxh2, Black has Rh8# (checkmate).\n- So, g1h2 loses immediately to Qxh2+.\n\n### 2. g2h3 (Pawn to h3)\n- This move blocks the h-file, preventing Qxh2+.\n- After g2h3, Black can try to continue the attack, but White survives for now.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only move that avoids immediate checkmate is g2h3.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng2h3\n```"
