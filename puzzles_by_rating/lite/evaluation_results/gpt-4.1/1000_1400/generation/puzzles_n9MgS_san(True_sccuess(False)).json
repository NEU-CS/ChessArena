If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Kg1\n\n- Black plays ...Qh1# (checkmate).\n\n### 2. Ke1\n\n- Black plays ...Qh1# (checkmate).\n\n### 3. Bg2\n\n- This blocks the h1 square, preventing ...Qh1#.\n- Now, Black cannot mate immediately.\n- Let's check if Black has any other immediate threats:\n\nAfter 37. Bg2, Black could try:\n- ...Qh1+ (not possible, blocked by Bg2)\n- ...Qxg2+ (captures the bishop, but then White can recapture with the queen or king)\n- ...Qh3xg2+ Kxg2, then Black can try ...Rh1# but the king is on g2, so not mate.\n\nSo after 37. Bg2 Qxg2+ 38. Qxg2 Nxg2, White loses the queen for two pieces, but avoids immediate mate.\n\nBut let's check if there is a better defense.\n\nIf 37. Bg2 Qxg2+ 38. Qxg2 Nxg2, White is down material, but not mated.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Bg2** is the only move that avoids immediate checkmate. The other two moves lose instantly.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nBg2\n```"
