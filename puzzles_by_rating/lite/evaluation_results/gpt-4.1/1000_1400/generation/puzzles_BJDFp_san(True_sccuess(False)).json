If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

If Black recaptures with Kxh7, then Qf4 threatens Qxf5 and Qh4+ ideas.\n2. **Nxf7**: Forking the queen and rook, but after Kxf7, White's attack may fizzle out.\n3. **Ne6**: Forking the queen and rook, but Black can respond with fxe6.\n4. **Qa5**: Attacks a7, but not very forcing.\n5. **Qf4**: Threatens Qxf5, but Black can defend.\n6. **Re4**: Lifts the rook for an attack, but not as forcing as Nxh7.\n\n**Calculation of Nxh7:**\n- 21. Nxh7 Kxh7 (forced)\n- 22. Qf4 (threatening Qxf5 and Qh4+)\n- If ... Qg5, then Qxg5 Rxg5, White has won a pawn and the attack continues.\n- If ... Qd7, then Qh4+ Kg8, Re3, White is building up a strong attack.\n\n**Calculation of Nxf7:**\n- 21. Nxf7 Kxf7 (forced)\n- 22. Qf4+ Kg8, White doesn't have a clear follow-up.\n\n**Calculation of Ne6:**\n- 21. Ne6 fxe6 (forced)\n- 22. Qxh6 Rxh6, not enough compensation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **Nxh7** is the most promising, as it opens up Black's king and gives White a strong attack.\n\nMy move:\n```\nNxh7\n```"
