If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

If 47. d4+ Kd6, White's king is cut off.\n- **Bb4**: 46...Bb4 attacks d3, but White can defend with d4+.\n- **Bc3**: 46...Bc3 attacks d3, but White can defend with d4+.\n- **Kd4**: 46...Kd4 47. Ne6+ Kd5 48. Nf4+ and White can harass the king.\n- **f4**: 46...f4 47. gxf4+ Kd4 48. Ne6+ Kd5 49. Nf8 and White's knight is active.\n\n**Best plan:**\n- The move **g5** fixes White's h4 pawn and prepares to play g4, potentially creating a passed pawn. If White takes hxg5, then Black can play Bd2 and attack the d3 pawn. If White ignores, Black can play g4+ and try to create a passed pawn.\n\n**Let's check the consequences of 46...g5:**\n- 47. hxg5 Bd2 48. g6 Kf6 and Black is threatening to win the d3 pawn and push the kingside pawns.\n\n**Therefore, the best move is:**\n```\ng5\n```"
