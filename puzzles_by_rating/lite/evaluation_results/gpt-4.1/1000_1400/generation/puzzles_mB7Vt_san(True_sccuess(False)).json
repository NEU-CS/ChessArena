If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Legal moves:** Kg6, Kf4, Ke4\n\nLet's reconstruct the board:\n\n- Black king: f5\n- Black rook: c1\n- Black rook: f5\n- Black pawns: a5, b4, f6, h4\n- White king: f2\n- White rook: d7, d5\n- White bishop: d7\n- White pawns: a2, b3, g2, h4\n\nWhite is up material (two rooks and a bishop for two rooks), but Black has some activity and White's king is not very safe.\n\n**Legal moves:** Kg6, Kf4, Ke4\n\nLet's analyze each:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Kg6**\n- Moves the king to g6, possibly defending the h-pawn and getting out of the center.\n- However, after Kg6, White can play Bxf5+ (bishop captures rook with check), and after Kxf5, White is up a piece and the attack is over.\n\n### 2. **Kf4**\n- Moves the king to f4, attacking the h4 pawn and threatening to invade.\n- However, White can play g3+ (pawn check), and after hxg3+, White can play Kg2, and Black's king is exposed.\n\n### 3. **Ke4**\n- Moves the king to e4, centralizing and attacking the d7 bishop.\n- After Ke4, White can play Bxf5+ (bishop captures rook with check), and after Kxf5, again White is up a piece.\n\n---\n\n**Tactical check:**\n\n- All three moves seem to allow Bxf5+.\n- However, let's check if any of these moves create a mating net or a perpetual.\n\n#### Let's check the consequences of each move:\n\n**After Kg6:**\n1. Bxf5+ Kxf5\n2. Rxa5+ (rook captures pawn with check)\n3. Kg6 (king returns)\n4. Rxa5, White is up a piece and wins.\n\n**After Kf4:**\n1. Bxf5 Kxf5\n2. Rxa5+, Kg6\n3. Rxa5, White is up a piece.\n\n**After Ke4:**\n1. Bxf5+ Kxf5\n2. Rxa5+, Kg6\n3. Rxa5, White is up a piece.\n\n**But what if White doesn't take the rook?**\n\n- All three moves allow Bxf5+.\n\n**Is there any way to avoid losing material?**\n\nNo, all three legal moves lose the rook on f5 to Bxf5+.\n\n**Which is the best practical try?**\n\n- Kg6 at least keeps the king closer to the kingside pawns and may allow some counterplay with h4-h3.\n- Kf4 exposes the king to checks.\n- Ke4 centralizes the king but doesn't seem to help.\n\n**Therefore, the best try is:**\n\n```\nKg6\n```"
