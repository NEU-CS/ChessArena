White's king is far away and cannot defend.\n- **Ke5** is also strong, but Ke4 is more direct.\n- **b5** is premature; better to use the king first.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Ke4** is the best move, maximizing the king's activity and threatening to win material.\n\nMy move:\n```\nKe4\n```"

If White plays Kf5, Black can play Kc3, attacking b3 and c4.\n- **b5:** If cxb5, then Kxd5, but White's king can become active.\n\n**Key point:** Black's king is much more active, and the queenside pawns can be supported by the king. The move **Kd4** is the most active, attacking c4 and threatening to invade. White's king is far from the action.\n\n**Best move:**  \n```\nKd4\n```"
