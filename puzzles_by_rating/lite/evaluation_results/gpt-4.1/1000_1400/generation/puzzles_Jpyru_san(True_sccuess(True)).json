Legal moves:** Kh8, Rxf7\n\n**Material count:**\n- Black: King (g8), Rook (f8), Bishop (h4), Knight (e4), Queen (c2), Pawns (g7, h7, c6)\n- White: King (g2), Queen (f7), Bishop (c4, c3), Pawn (c5, h2), Rook (a1)\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- White's queen on f7 is very active, threatening mate on g8 if the rook moves.\n- White's bishops are well placed, especially the one on c4, which controls the long diagonal.\n- Black's king is exposed.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n1. Kh8: Moves the king to h8, but this allows Qxf8# (mate).\n2. Rxf7: Rook captures the queen on f7.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- If 1...Kh8, then 2. Qxf8# is checkmate.\n- If 1...Rxf7, Black captures the queen, removing the immediate threat of mate and gaining material.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only move that avoids immediate checkmate is Rxf7.\n\n```\nRxf7\n```"
