When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has an extra pawn, but White has more active pieces.\n\nTactical and strategic considerations:\n- The Black king is somewhat exposed on c7.\n- The White knight on b4 is attacking c6 and a6.\n- The rook on c1 is well placed on the open file.\n- The knight on e1 is passive but can be repositioned.\n- Black's knight on f4 is active and attacks g2 and e2.\n- Black's rook on d2 is active, possibly threatening to invade.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. c1c7: Rook to 7th rank, attacking g7 and possibly a6.\n2. b4c6+: Knight check, but after Kb7, the knight could be trapped.\n3. e5e6: Pawn push, attacking f7 and opening lines.\n4. e1d3: Knight to d3, attacking f4 and supporting e5.\n5. h2h4: Pawn push, attacking the knight.\n6. g2g3: Kicking the knight.\n\nLet's analyze the most forcing moves:\n\n1. c1c7+:\n- If Kb8, then Nxa6+ wins the rook after Ka8, or White can continue attacking.\n- If Kd8, White can continue with Nc6+.\n\n2. b4c6+:\n- Kb7, then Na5+ Ka7, Nc6+ Kb7, and the knight is not trapped, but White is not making progress.\n\n3. e5e6: \n- Threatens e7, but Black can play Nxe6 or Ne2+.\n\n4. g2g3: \n- Kicks the knight, but Nxe2+ is possible.\n\n5. c1c6: \n- Attacks the knight, but doesn't seem as strong as c1c7.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the most promising move is:\n```\nc1c7\n```\nThis puts the rook on the 7th rank, attacking the king and threatening to invade."
