Kc5, the king attacks the knight on d6. If the knight moves, the a6 pawn can advance. For example, 1...Nxf7 2. a7 Kb7 3. Kd6 Kxa7 4. Ke6 e4 5. Kf5 e3 6. Ke4 e2 7. Ke3 e1=Q+ 8. Kf3, but this is a race. However, after 1...Nxf7, White can play a7 and the pawn is unstoppable.\n- **b5a5:** If 1. Ka5, the king stays close to the a-pawn, but doesn't threaten the knight.\n- **b5b4** and **b5a4:** Both moves abandon the a6 pawn, which is not advisable.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **b5c5** is the strongest, attacking the knight and supporting the a-pawn. If Black plays Nxf7, White can push a7 and the pawn will queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb5c5\n```"

After Kb7, the pawn is blockaded, but the White king can try to help.\n2. g3g4: Try to create a passed pawn on the kingside, but Black's king is far, and White's king is needed on the queenside.\n3. King moves: c5d5, c5b5, c5c4, c5b4. These are all king moves, but the king is already well-placed to support the a-pawn.\n\n**Deeper look:**\n- After a6a7 Kb7, White can try Kd5, but Black can play Kxa7 if the king leaves the pawn.\n- If White plays a6a7 and Black plays Kb7, White can try Kd5, but Black's king is still blockading.\n- If White plays g3g4, Black can ignore it and focus on the queenside.\n\n**Best plan:**\n- Push a6a7 to force Black's king to b7, then try to maneuver the king to support the pawn or create zugzwang.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to push the a-pawn.\n\n```\na6a7\n```"

The a7 pawn is ready to promote, but the Black king is on b7, directly next to the promotion square. However, the Black king cannot capture on a8 after promotion, so promotion is possible. The Black knight is on f7, far from the action, and Black has pawns on e5 and g5.\n\nLet's consider the candidate moves:\n\n1. **a7a8q** (promote to queen): After this, Black can play Kxa8, but that's not possible since the king is on b7 and a8 is not occupied. So after a7a8Q, the queen is on a8, king on c5, Black king on b7, knight on f7, pawns on e5 and g5. Black's best is probably Kxa8, but that's not legal. So Black will have to move the knight or push a pawn.\n\n2. **a7a8r**, **a7a8b**, **a7a8n**: Promotions to rook, bishop, or knight are inferior to queen.\n\n3. **g3g4**: This is slow and doesn't address the promotion.\n\n4. **King moves**: c5d5, c5b5, c5c4, c5b4: All these king moves don't threaten anything immediate, and allow Black to play Ka8 and block the pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.\n\nLet's check for stalemate: After a7a8Q, Black's king is on b7, queen on a8, White king on c5, Black knight on f7, Black pawns on e5 and g5. Black has moves: the knight can move, pawns can move, king can move to a8 or c8. No stalemate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na7a8q\n```"
