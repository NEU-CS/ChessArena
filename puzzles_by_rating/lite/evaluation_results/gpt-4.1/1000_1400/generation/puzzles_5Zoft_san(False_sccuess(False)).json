When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This is a strong tactical shot.\n2. **c5d4**: Bishop takes d4, but that just exchanges pieces.\n3. **e7g6**: Knight to g6, attacking the bishop on f4, but White can just move the bishop.\n4. **d7d6**: Solid, but passive.\n5. **h7h6**: Kicks the bishop, but not urgent.\n6. **d8e8**: Centralizes the queen, but not active enough.\n\n**Tactical Check:**\n- After **c6d4**, if White plays exd4, then Bxd4, and Black is very active.\n- If White plays Qg3, then Nxf5, and Black wins a piece.\n- If White plays Qf2, then Nxf5, and Black wins a piece.\n- If White plays Qh5, then Nxf5, and Black wins a piece.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **c6d4** attacks both the queen and the bishop, and White cannot defend both. This is a classic fork, and Black is winning material.\n\nMy move is:\n```\nc6d4\n```"
