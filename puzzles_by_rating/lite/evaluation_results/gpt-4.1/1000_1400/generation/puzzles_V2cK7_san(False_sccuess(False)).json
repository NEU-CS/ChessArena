When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is far away from the action.\n\n**Candidate moves:**  \n- f4g5: King moves closer to the center, but doesn't threaten anything immediately.\n- f4f5: King steps up, but doesn't threaten to invade.\n- f4e5: King centralizes, attacks d5 pawn.\n- f4e4: King steps forward, attacks c4 and d5 pawns.\n- f4f3: King steps toward the queenside, but not optimal.\n- f4e3: King heads toward the queenside pawns.\n- b6b5: Pawn push, but could allow White to create a passed pawn on the a-file.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n\n- **f4e5:** This move attacks d5, and if White pushes d5-d6, Black can play Kxd6 and start eating pawns. If White plays Kg4, Black can continue to centralize and attack pawns.\n- **f4e4:** This move attacks c4 and d5, and also keeps options open to go to d3 or f3.\n- **b6b5:** This move is risky, as it allows a4xb5, and after a5xb5, White's a-pawn could become dangerous.\n\n**Best move:**  \nThe most active and aggressive move is **f4e5**, attacking d5 and threatening to invade White's position. White's king is too far to help, and Black's king will start gobbling up pawns.\n\nTherefore, my move is:\n```\nf4e5\n```"
