If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Bxc6+ bxc6\n   - Nxe4 (attacks bishop on e6 and threatens to win a pawn)\n   - If ...Bd5, then Nc3, defending the queen and developing.\n   - If ...Rc8, then O-O.\n\n2. O-O (castling)\n   - Black can play ...Nd6 or ...Qd5, but White is safe and can play d3 next.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Bxc6+ is the most forcing and seems to win a pawn after Nxe4, with no immediate counterplay for Black.\n- O-O is safe but less ambitious.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nBxc6+\n```"
