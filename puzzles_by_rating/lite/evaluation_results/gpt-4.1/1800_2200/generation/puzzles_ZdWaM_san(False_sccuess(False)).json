When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...Re1, then White can play Rd1 and after ...Qe1, Kc2, and White is safe. But after Qd6, Black can play Qe1, but White can block with Rd1.\n- **g7g8**: Rook to 8th, but Black can play Rxg8, then after Qg8, Qe1 is check, but White can block with Rd1.\n- **e5d6**: Bishop takes knight, but after ...Re1, White must be careful.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **a3d6**: This wins a piece (the knight), and if Black tries ...Re1, White can block with Rd1. If ...Qe1, then Rd1, and White is safe. White is up a piece and should be winning.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na3d6\n```"
