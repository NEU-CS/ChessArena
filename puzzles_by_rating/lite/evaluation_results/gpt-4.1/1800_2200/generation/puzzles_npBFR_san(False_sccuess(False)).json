When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Queen moves: e1-e5, e1-e4, e1-e3, e1-f2, e1-e2, e1-d2, etc. Only e1-e5 blocks the f7 square.\n4. Rook moves: d8-d7, d8-d6, etc. Only d8-d7 blocks the f7 square.\n\n**Best defense:**\n- The only way to stop Qxf7# is to block the f7 square.\n- e6-e5 is possible, but after Rxd8+ Kxd8 Qf8# is mate.\n- e1-e5 is possible, but after Qxe5, White wins the queen.\n- d8-d7 is possible, but after Rxd7 Nxd7 Qxf7# is still mate.\n- e1-f2 is possible, but after Qxf7# is still mate.\n\n**Is there any way to prevent mate?**\n- No. All legal moves fail to prevent Qxf7#.\n\nBut let's check e1-e5:\n- 1... Qe5 2. Qxe5 Nd7+ 3. Rxd7 Kxd7 4. Qe7+ Kc8 5. Qc7#\n\nBut after 1... Qe5, White can simply play Qxe5, and Black is lost.\n\n**Is there any move that gives Black a check?**\n- No, Black has no checks.\n\n**Is there any move that covers f7?**\n- Only e6-e5 and e1-e5.\n\nBut both lose to Rxd8+ or Qxe5.\n\n**Conclusion:** Black is lost, but the only way to delay mate is to block the f7 square.\n\n**Best move:** \n```\ne1e5\n```"
