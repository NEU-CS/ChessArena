When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Not directly, but White has more space and could double rooks on the d-file.\n- Consider exchanges: Trading queens or rooks could relieve pressure.\n- Improve piece placement: The knight on c6 could move to d4, but it's protected.\n- d6d4: Exchange knights, which would relieve some central pressure.\n- d8d7: Double rooks on the d-file, contesting White's control.\n- h7h6: Give the king luft, but not urgent.\n- f7f6: Not needed, weakens e6.\n- c6d4: Not a legal move, as White's knight is on d4.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- d6d4: If Qxd4, Nxd4, Rxd4, Rxd4, White wins a pawn.\n- d6d4: If Nxd4, Qxd4, cxd4, Rxd4, White wins a pawn.\n- So, d6d4 is not good.\n\n- d8d7: Prepares to double rooks, contesting the d-file.\n- d8e7: Also possible, but less active.\n\n- c6d4: Not legal.\n\n- d6g3: Queen to g3, attacking g2, but White can defend easily.\n\n- b7b6: Slightly weakens c6, not necessary.\n\n- g8h8: King to h8, not necessary.\n\n- d6c5: Queen to c5, attacks d4, but White can defend.\n\n- d6e5: Queen to e5, centralizes, but White can play Rfe1.\n\n- d8e5: Not legal.\n\n- d8d7: Seems the most logical, contesting the d-file.\n\n**Final decision:**\n- d8d7 is solid, contests the d-file, and prepares to double rooks. No immediate tactics for White.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd8d7\n```"
