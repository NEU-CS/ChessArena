When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This is a natural move to get the king to safety, but White can play Nxe5, and after Nxe5, Bxe5, Black's bishop on d7 is hanging.\n- **d8a5:** Queen move, possibly to pin the knight on c3, but White can respond with Qd2.\n- **c6d4:** Knight jump, attacking the queen and bishop, but White can play cxd4.\n- **f7f6:** Supports the e5 knight, but weakens the kingside.\n\n**Critical lines:**\n- If Black castles kingside (e8g8), White plays Nxe5, and after Nxe5, Bxe5, Black loses the bishop on d7.\n- If Black plays c6d4, White can play cxd4, and Black loses a piece.\n- If Black plays e5xf3, White recaptures with Nxf3, and Black's center is still under pressure.\n\n**Best move:**\nThe most prudent move is to castle kingside (e8g8), getting the king to safety and connecting the rooks. Although White can win a pawn with Nxe5, Black will have compensation with the bishop pair and active pieces.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne8g8\n```"
