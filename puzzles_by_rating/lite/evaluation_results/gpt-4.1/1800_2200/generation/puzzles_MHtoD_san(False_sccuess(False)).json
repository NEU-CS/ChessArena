When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:**\n- f7f8\n- f7e7\n- f7e6\n- g8g6\n\n**Material:**\n- Black: King on f7, Rooks on d8 and g8, Queen on d7, pawns on b7, h7, f6\n- White: King on d3, Queen on h5, Rook on g1, pawns on a3, b2, c2, d4, Bishop on e3\n\n**Threats:**\n- White threatens Qxh7+ and Qg7# (mate).\n- Black's king is exposed.\n- Black's queen and rooks are active, but the king is in danger.\n\n**Move analysis:**\n\n1. **f7f8**: Retreating the king to f8. This doesn't address the threat of Qxh7+ followed by Qg7# (mate).\n2. **f7e7**: King to e7. After Qxh7+ Ke6, White can continue with Qe4+ and Black's king is in a mating net.\n3. **f7e6**: King to e6. After Qh3+ f5, White can play Qh6 and Black is still in trouble.\n4. **g8g6**: Rook to g6, defending the g7 square and blocking Qg7#. After Qxh7+ Rg7, White can't mate immediately.\n\n**Best move:**\n- The only move that prevents immediate mate is **g8g6**. All other moves allow White to deliver mate or win significant material.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng8g6\n```"
