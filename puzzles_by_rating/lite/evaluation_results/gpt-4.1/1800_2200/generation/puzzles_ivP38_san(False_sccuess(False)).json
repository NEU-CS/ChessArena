When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black plays Qc1+, White can play Qd1, blocking the check. If Black plays Qc2, White can play Qxc2. If Black plays d4, White can play Qb4+ and then Qxd4. If Black plays d5-d4, White can play Qb4+ and then Qxd4.\n- **e5e6**: If e6, Black can play Qxe6, but then Qb4+ wins the queen after Kg8. If Black plays fxe6, then Qb4+ is strong.\n- **b3b7**: Queen to b7 attacks d5, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n**Best Move:**\n\nThe move **g5g7** is extremely strong, threatening to promote the f7 pawn and tying Black down. Black cannot stop f7-f8=Q without heavy material loss.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5g7\n```"
