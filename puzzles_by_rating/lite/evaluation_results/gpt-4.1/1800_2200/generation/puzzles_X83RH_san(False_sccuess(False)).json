When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black must respond.\n2. **b3c5**: Knight attacks bishop and threatens to jump to e6 or d7.\n3. **a5a6**: Advance the pawn, but Black can take with the queen.\n4. **b3d4**: Knight centralizes, but not as forcing.\n5. **a1a4**: Attack along the a-file, but not immediately threatening.\n\n**Calculation of f3f7:**\n- 35. Qxf7 Rf8 (forced, to block mate)\n- 36. Qxa7+ Bxa7\n- 37. Nc5 (threatening mate on b7)\n- Black is in trouble; White is winning.\n\n**Calculation of b3c5:**\n- 35. Nc5 Bxc5\n- 36. Qxf7 Qxf7\n- 37. Rb8+ Rxb8\n- 38. Rb1 Rxb1#\n- Not as strong.\n\n**Calculation of b3d4:**\n- 35. Nd4 Bxd4\n- 36. Qxf7 Qxf7\n- 37. Rb8+ Rxb8\n- 38. Rb1 Rxb1#\n- Same as above.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **f3f7** wins material and threatens mate, forcing Black to give up the queen or get mated. This is the strongest move.\n\nMy move:\n```\nf3f7\n```"
