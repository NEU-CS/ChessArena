When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Also, the pawn on e5 is weak.\n2. **g6xf5**: Captures the knight, but after exf5, White's queen and rook become more active.\n3. **e6xd5**: Captures the pawn, but after exd5, White's pieces become more active.\n4. **e5e4**: Pushes the pawn, attacking the queen and gaining space.\n5. **f8h6**: Moves the bishop to h6, attacking the rook on c1 and possibly defending the king.\n6. **d8d7**: Defends the queen and prepares to double rooks.\n7. **e6e8**: Retreats the queen, but is passive.\n\n**Deep Calculation:**\n- After **e5e4**, if White plays fxe4, then Nxe4, and Black has a strong knight in the center.\n- If White plays Qxe4, then Nxe4, fxe4, and Black can play Bc5+ or Rd7, gaining activity.\n- **e5e4** also attacks the queen, forcing White to react.\n\n**Tactical Check:**\n- Is there any immediate threat to the Black king? Not directly, but White's pieces are active.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **e5e4** is a strong move, attacking the queen, gaining space, and opening lines for Black's pieces.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\ne5e4\n```"
