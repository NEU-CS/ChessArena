When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Nf5-g7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n2. Qe3 (threatening Qxh6+ and Qxh6 is mate, since the king is on g7 and the bishop is pinned)\n\nBut after 2...Bg5, Black can defend.\n\nAlternatively, after Nf5-g7+ Kxg7, White can play Qe3, threatening Qxh6, but Black can play Bg5, defending h6.\n\nIs there a better move?\n\nWhat about Qe3 immediately? That threatens Qxh6, but Black can play Bg5.\n\nWhat about Qe1? That threatens Qxg7#.\n\nBut after Qe1, Black can play Qxc1+ and after Kxc1, Bg5+.\n\nBut White can play Qe1, and if Qxc1+ Kxc1, Bg5+ Bxg5 hxg5, White is still winning.\n\nBut let's check the most forcing move: Nf5-g7+.\n\n1. Nf5-g7+ Kxg7\n2. Qe3 Bg5\n3. Qxg5 hxg5\n\nWhite is up a pawn, but loses the queen for two pieces.\n\nAlternatively, after Nf5-g7+ Kxg7, is there a better follow-up?\n\nAlternatively, what about Qe3 immediately?\n\n1. Qe3 (threatening Qxh6)\nIf Black plays Bg5, then Qxg5 hxg5, White is up a pawn.\n\nAlternatively, what about Qe1?\n\n1. Qe1 (threatening Qxg7#)\nIf Black plays Qxc1+, then Kxc1, Bg5+ Bxg5 hxg5, White is still up a queen for a bishop.\n\nBut let's check for a mate:\n\n1. Qe1 Qxc1+\n2. Kxc1 Bg5+\n3. Bxg5 hxg5\n\nWhite is up a queen for a bishop.\n\nAlternatively, after Qe1, if Black plays Qd3+, White can play Ka1, and Black has no follow-up.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3e1\n```"
