When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is also active, and White has a passed f-pawn.\n\n**Legal moves:**\n- Rook moves: g5g8, g5g7, g5g6, g5h5, g5f5, g5e5, g5d5, g5c5, g5b5, g5a5\n- King moves: e3f4, e3e2\n- Pawn moves: f2f3, f2f4\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. Rook moves: The rook can swing to the 8th rank or along the 5th rank. \n   - g5g8, g5g7, g5g6: These don't threaten anything immediately.\n   - g5h5: Lateral move, doesn't threaten much.\n   - g5f5, g5e5, g5d5: These attack the e4 pawn, but the c4 rook defends it.\n   - g5c5: This would exchange rooks, but White is ahead, so trading is good.\n   - g5b5, g5a5: Not relevant.\n\n2. King moves: e3f4, e3e2\n   - e3f4: Moves toward the center, but could allow checks from Black's rook.\n   - e3e2: Retreats, not ideal.\n\n3. Pawn moves: f2f3, f2f4\n   - f2f3: Supports g4, but doesn't change much.\n   - f2f4: Attacks e4, but Black can capture en passant (e4f3).\n\n**Key ideas:**\n- Trading rooks is good for White, as White is up material.\n- The c5 square is protected by Black's rook, so g5c5 would force a trade.\n- After g5c5, if Black takes, White recaptures with the king, and the endgame is easily won with the extra rook and pawns.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. g5c5 Rxc5 Kxc5 Kd3 (Black tries to activate king) Kd4 (White centralizes) and White will win easily.\n2. If Black avoids the trade, White can double rooks on the 5th rank or push pawns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to force the rook trade with g5c5.\n\n```\ng5c5\n```"
