The pawn is still weak and can be captured by White's queen or rook.\n\n### 2. c7d6\n- This captures White's pawn on d6, opening the c-file for the rook and removing White's passed pawn.\n- After c7d6, White could play dxe5, attacking the queen and bishop. But after Qxe5, Black maintains material balance and central control.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- If c7d6, White cannot recapture with the pawn (since the pawn is on e4), but could try dxe5, but that's not possible since d4 is the only pawn on the d-file.\n- Actually, after c7d6, White's queen on b6 is still active, but Black has removed a dangerous pawn.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Removing White's passed pawn is important.\n- Keeping the c-file open for the rook could be useful.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to capture the pawn with c7d6, removing White's dangerous passed pawn and opening the c-file for the rook.\n\nMy move:\n```\nc7d6\n```"
