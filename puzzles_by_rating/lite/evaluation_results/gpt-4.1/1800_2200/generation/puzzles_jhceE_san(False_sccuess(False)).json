When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The knight on c4 is powerful, and both bishops are active.\n- White's pieces are somewhat passive, and the king is vulnerable.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. **h5h4**: Kicks the bishop, possibly opening the h-file for attack.\n2. **c4d2**: Knight jump, attacking the rook on b1 and threatening Ne4+ ideas.\n3. **e7f6**: Retreats bishop, but not aggressive.\n4. **e6d7**: Retreats bishop, not necessary.\n5. **g8h8**: Rook lift, not urgent.\n6. **d5d4**: Opens the center, but White's king is on f2, so this could be dangerous for White.\n7. **c4e3**: Forks the king and rook, but the pawn on e3 covers that.\n\n**Deep Analysis:**\n- **h5h4**: If 31.Bh2, then ...h3 is possible, opening the h-file. If 31.Bxh4, then ...Bxh4+ and the king is exposed.\n- **c4d2**: Attacks the rook on b1. If 31.Nxd2, then ...h4, but White can play Bh2.\n- **d5d4**: If 31.cxd4, then ...c3, but White can play Rgc1. If 31.Nxd4, then ...h4.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **h5h4** is the most direct, as it attacks the bishop and threatens to open the h-file against the White king. White's bishop is forced to move, and after ...h3, the h-file could be opened for a rook swing or bishop attack.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh5h4\n```"
