When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's bishop on c7 is very active, and Black's bishop on c3 is blockading the f3 pawn.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- c7d8: Bishop attacks e6 pawn, but doesn't threaten much.\n- c7b8: Retreats bishop, not active.\n- c7d6: Attacks e6 pawn, but Black can defend.\n- c7b6: Attacks a5 pawn, but Black can defend.\n- c7e5: Centralizes bishop, attacks e6 pawn.\n- c7a5: Attacks a5 pawn, but Black can defend.\n- c7f4: Bishop to f4, attacks h2 and g3, but doesn't threaten much.\n- c7g3: Bishop to g3, attacks h4 pawn.\n- c7h2: Bishop to h2, attacks h4 pawn.\n- f1f2, f1e2, f1g1: King moves, not urgent.\n- f3f4: Pawn push, attacks e5 square, but e6 pawn is defended.\n- b3b4: Pawn push, attacks a5 pawn.\n\nThe most promising moves are c7g3 and c7h2, attacking the h4 pawn, which is a weakness. If we play c7g3, Black cannot defend the h4 pawn, and after Bxh4, White will have two connected passed pawns on the kingside, which should be decisive.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc7g3\n```"
