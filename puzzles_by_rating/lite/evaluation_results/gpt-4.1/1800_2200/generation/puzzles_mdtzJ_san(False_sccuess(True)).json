This keeps the king on the h-file, but White can play Qf7+ (check), and after Kh8, Qf6+ is mate (since the g7 and h7 squares are covered by the knight and queen). So h6h7 loses to a forced mate.\n\n2. **h6g5**: King moves to g5. Let's see if White has a forced mate:\n   - Qf5+ is possible, but after Kh4, White can play Qh5# (mate).\n   - Alternatively, after Kg5, White can play Qf4# (mate).\n\nSo, both moves seem to lose to immediate mate, but let's check carefully:\n\nAfter h6g5:\n- Qf5+ Kg4 (only move)\n- Qg4# (mate)\n\nSo, both moves lose to forced mate.\n\nBut since only two legal moves are available, and both lose, I must select one.\n\nLet's play:\n```\nh6g5\n```"
