When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Legal moves:**\n- g1h2 (King to h2)\n- g1h1 (King to h1)\n- g1f1 (King to f1)\n- f6d4 (Queen to d4)\n- d6d4 (Rook to d4)\n- d1d4 (Rook to d4)\n\n**Material:**\n- White: Queen (f6), Rook (d6), Rook (d1), Bishop (c4), pawns\n- Black: Queen (c5), Rook (e7), Rook (f8), Knight (f7), pawns\n\n**Position:**\n- White's queen and rook are very active, especially on the 6th rank.\n- Black's king is on e8, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's queen is on c5, eyeing the kingside and center.\n- White's king is relatively safe for now.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. f6d4 (Queen takes d4): This grabs a central square, but the queen is already very active on f6. Also, it may allow Black some counterplay.\n2. d6d4 (Rook takes d4): Similar, but less active than the queen.\n3. d1d4 (Other rook takes d4): Same as above.\n4. King moves (g1h2, g1h1, g1f1): Defensive, but not necessary unless there is a direct threat.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- Is there a threat of mate or a strong attack for either side?\n- Is there a way to increase pressure on Black's king?\n\n**Calculation:**\n- f6d4: If Qxd4, Black can play Qxd4+, Rxd4, and then perhaps g5, but White is still pressing.\n- d6d4: Rook takes d4, but then Black can play Qxd4+, Rxd4, and again, White is pressing.\n- d1d4: Rook takes d4, but then Black can play Qxd4+, Rxd4, and again, White is pressing.\n\nBut let's look for tactics:\n- f6d4 threatens to double up on the 8th rank with Rd8+.\n- If f6d4, and Black plays Qxd4+, White can play Rxd4, and Black has no immediate checks.\n\n**Is there a direct mate?**\n- f6d4, if Black plays Qxd4+, Rxd4, and then Black has no checks.\n- If Black does not exchange queens, White threatens Rd8+.\n\n**Let's check f6d4:**\n1. f6d4 Qxd4+ 2. Rxd4 (now what can Black do?)\n   - Black's king is still stuck on e8.\n   - White threatens Rd8# (if the rook leaves f8).\n   - Black can try to defend with moves like Re1+ or Qc7, but White is still pressing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- f6d4 is the most active move, centralizing the queen, threatening to double rooks on the 8th rank, and keeping up the pressure.\n- The king moves are too passive.\n- Rook moves to d4 are less effective than the queen move.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf6d4\n```"
