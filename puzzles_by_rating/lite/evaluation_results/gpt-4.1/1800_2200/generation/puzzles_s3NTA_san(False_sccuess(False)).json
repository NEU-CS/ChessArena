When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's c3 pawn is advanced and could be a threat if it can promote, but White's king is nearby. Black's a5 pawn can also advance, but White has a pawn majority on the queenside.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f5g6: King moves toward the kingside, possibly to support h5-h4 or to attack White's pawns.\n2. f5f6: King steps back, less active.\n3. f5e6: King centralizes, possibly to support c3 or d5.\n4. f5g5: King stays active, but not clear what it achieves.\n5. f5g4: King invades kingside, but White's pawns are safe for now.\n6. h5h4: Pushes the h-pawn, but White can block with g4.\n7. a5a4: Pushes the a-pawn, but White can respond with b4.\n8. c3c2: Pushes the c-pawn, threatening promotion, but White can play Kd2 and stop it.\n\nDeep analysis:\n- c3c2 is tempting, but after Kd2, Black cannot promote and White will win the c-pawn.\n- a5a4 is met by b4, and Black cannot make progress.\n- h5h4 is met by g4, and White's kingside is solid.\n- King moves: f5e6 or f5g6. f5e6 centralizes and keeps options open, possibly supporting c3 or d5. f5g6 heads to the kingside, but White's king is closer to the queenside, where the main action is.\n\nBest move:\n- Centralizing the king with f5e6 is the most flexible and keeps Black's options alive. It supports both the c3 pawn and can help on the queenside if needed.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf5e6\n```"
