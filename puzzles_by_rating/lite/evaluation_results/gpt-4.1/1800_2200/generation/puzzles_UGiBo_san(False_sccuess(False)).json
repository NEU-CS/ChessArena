When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxd8 Rfxd8 (forced)\n2. Bxa8 Nc2+ (forks king and rook)\n3. Ke2 Nxa1\n\nSo, after Qxd8 Rfxd8 Bxa8 Nc2+ Ke2 Nxa1, White is up the exchange (rook for bishop), but Black's knight is very strong.\n\nAlternatively, what about Bxa8 first?\n1. Bxa8 Qxd2+ (forced)\n2. Kxd2 Nc4+ (forks king and rook)\n3. Kc2 Rxa8\n\nNow, White is down material.\n\nWhat about Qxe3?\n1. Qxe3 Qxd2+ (forced)\n2. Kxd2 Rfd8+ (skewers king and queen)\n3. Kc2 (only move) Bf5+ (develops bishop with tempo)\n4. Kb3 Be6+ (another tempo)\n5. Kc2 Bf5+ (draw by repetition)\n\nSo, Qxe3 leads to a draw by perpetual check.\n\nWhat about Qxd2?\n1. Qxd2 exd2+ (pawn promotes soon)\n2. Kd1 Rad8 (threatening to promote)\n3. Bb7 (try to stop pawn) Rd6 (supports pawn)\n4. fxe3 (finally capture knight) Rb8\n\nNot promising.\n\nWhat about fxe3?\n1. fxe3 Qxd2+ (forced)\n2. Kxd2 Rfd8+ (skewer)\n3. Kc2 Bf5+ (tempo)\n4. Kb3 Be6+ (tempo)\n5. Kc2 Bf5+ (draw by repetition)\n\nAgain, perpetual check.\n\nWhat about a quiet move like h4?\nBlack will just take the queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the queen with Qxd8+, forcing Black to recapture, then take the rook on a8, and after Nc2+ Ke2 Nxa1, White is up the exchange but Black's knight is very strong.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd2d8\n```"
