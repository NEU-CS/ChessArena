When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's carefully analyze the position:\n\n**FEN:** r2q1r2/2p5/p2p1pbk/1p1PP3/4n3/2P1Q1R1/PP4PP/5RK1 b - - 0 27\n\n**Black to move. Legal moves:**  \n- h6h7 (King retreat to h7)  \n- h6g7 (King captures on g7)  \n- h6h5 (King to h5)  \n- e4g5 (Knight to g5)\n\n**Position assessment:**\n- Black's king is on h6, exposed but not immediately in danger of mate.\n- White has a queen on e3, rook on g3, and rook on f1, with pawns on d5 and e5. White is threatening a kingside attack.\n- Black's knight is on e4, bishop on f6, queen on d8, rook on f8, rook on a8, pawns on a6, b5, c7, d6, and g7.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **h6h7:** Retreats the king to h7, but White can continue the attack, possibly with Rh3+ or Qh6+.\n2. **h6g7:** King captures rook on g7. This is risky, as the king becomes even more exposed, but it does remove a major attacker.\n3. **h6h5:** King to h5, walking into the open. This looks very dangerous.\n4. **e4g5:** Knight to g5, blocking the g-file and attacking the queen on e3. This is a defensive resource, possibly stopping immediate threats.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n\n- **h6g7:** If Kxg7, White can play Qh6+ and after Kf7, Qg6+ Ke7, Qe6# is mate. So this loses immediately.\n- **h6h7:** If Kh7, White can play Rh3+ Kg8 (forced), then Qh6, threatening mate on h8. Black can try Re8, but after Qh8+ Kf7, e6# is mate. So this also loses.\n- **h6h5:** If Kh5, White can play Qh6+ Kxh6, Rh3# is mate.\n- **e4g5:** Knight to g5 attacks the queen and blocks the g-file. Let's see what happens:\n    - If Qxg5+ (White queen captures knight), then Bxg5, Rxg5, Qxg5, fxg5, Rxf8, Qxf8, Rxf8, Rxf8. Black loses a lot of material, but let's check if there is a forced mate.\n    - If White doesn't take the knight, Black has blocked the g-file, so immediate mate threats are gone.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe only move that doesn't lose immediately is **e4g5**. It blocks the g-file and attacks the queen, forcing White to respond.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne4g5\n```"
