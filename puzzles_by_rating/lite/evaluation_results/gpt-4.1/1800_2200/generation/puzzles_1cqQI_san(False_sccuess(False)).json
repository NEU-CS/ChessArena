When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's carefully analyze the position:\n\n**Position Overview:**\n- Black to move.\n- Material: Black is down the exchange (rook for minor piece), but White's king is exposed on c1 and Black has some tactical resources.\n- White's threats: White is threatening to double rooks on the 7th rank (Rd7), and the queen is centralized. White's knight on g3 is also eyeing f5/h5.\n- Black's pieces: The queen on h2 is very active, threatening mate on c2 if the c-pawn moves. The bishop on g2 is also well-placed, controlling key diagonals. Black's rooks are on the back rank, but can be activated.\n\n**Immediate Tactics:**\n- The move ...Qxg1 is possible, but after Rxg1, Black loses the queen for a rook.\n- The move ...Qh1 is possible, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.\n- The move ...Bf3 is possible, attacking the queen and threatening ...Qxg1.\n- The move ...Qh3 is possible, attacking the knight on g3.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n1. ...Bf3: Attacks the queen and threatens ...Qxg1. If White plays Qxf3, then Qxg1+ and Black wins material.\n2. ...Qh3: Attacks the knight, but White can defend with Rd2 or Qf2.\n3. ...Qxg1: Loses the queen for a rook.\n4. ...h5: Prepares ...h4 to attack the knight.\n\n**Calculating ...Bf3:**\n- 20...Bf3\n  - If 21. Qxf3, then 21...Qxg1+ 22. Rd1 Qc5 and Black is better.\n  - If 21. Nf1, then 21...Qxg1 22. Qxg1 Bxd1 and Black wins a rook.\n  - If 21. Rd2, then 21...Qxg1+ 22. Qxg1 Bxd1 and Black wins a rook.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move ...Bf3 is a strong tactical shot, threatening to win material and possibly the game.\n\n**Final Move:**\n```\ng2f3\n```"
