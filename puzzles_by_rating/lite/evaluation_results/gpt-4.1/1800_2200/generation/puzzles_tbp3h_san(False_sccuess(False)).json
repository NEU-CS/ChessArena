When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's knight on c4 is active, but White's pieces are coordinated for an attack.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- f4e6 (Nxe6): Captures bishop, but after fxe6, Black's pawn structure is weakened, but White's knight is exchanged for a bishop.\n- e4d6 (Bxd6): Captures knight, but after Nxd6, Black's knight is exchanged for bishop.\n- f4g5: Knight moves to g5, threatening h7 and e6.\n- h4h5: Pawn push, threatening hxg6 and opening the h-file.\n- g4g5: Pawn push, attacking the knight and opening lines.\n- d1d6: Rook to d6, attacking the bishop on e6 and possibly doubling on the d-file.\n- f4g3: Retreats knight, but loses pressure.\n\nKey tactical ideas:\n- The move h4h5 threatens hxg6, opening the h-file for an attack.\n- The move f4g5 threatens to bring more pieces into the attack, especially with the bishop on e4 and potential rook lifts.\n- The move d1d6 attacks the bishop and could double rooks on the d-file.\n\nLet's calculate h4h5:\n1. h4h5 g5 (if Black takes) 2. h5g6 h7g6 3. f4g6 fxg6 4. Bxg6 and White has a strong attack on the h-file.\nIf Black does not take, White can play hxg6 next move.\n\nLet's calculate f4g5:\n1. f4g5 Bxg4 2. fxg4 and White has opened the f-file, but lost the knight.\n\nLet's calculate d1d6:\n1. d1d6 Nxd6 2. Rxd6 and White has won a piece, but is that possible? No, the bishop on e4 is not protected.\n\nLet's calculate f4e6:\n1. f4e6 fxe6 and White has exchanged knight for bishop, but Black's pawn structure is weakened.\n\nBetween these, h4h5 is the most aggressive and keeps the initiative, threatening to open the h-file and attack Black's king.\n\nMy move:\n```\nh4h5\n```"
