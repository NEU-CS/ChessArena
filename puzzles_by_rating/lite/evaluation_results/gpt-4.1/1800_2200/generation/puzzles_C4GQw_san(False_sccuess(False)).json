When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black plays fxe6, White can play Qxe6, threatening mate on f7 and attacking the rook on h8. If Black plays Bxe6, White can play Qxe6, again threatening mate and attacking the rook.\n2. **c2f5**: Attacks the bishop on e7 and puts pressure on g7, but Black can respond with g6.\n3. **e2e3**: Develops the bishop, but is slow.\n4. **c2e4**: Attacks the knight on c6 and bishop on b4, but Black can play dxe4.\n5. **f3g5**: Attacks the bishop on e7 and threatens Qh5, but Black can play h6.\n\n**Deep analysis of e5e6:**\n- e5e6 fxe6 (forced, otherwise White wins a piece)\n- Qxe6 Qd7 (defending f7)\n- Qxd7+ Kxd7\n- White has won the right to castle queenside, Black's king is exposed, and White has a lead in development.\n\nAlternatively,\n- e5e6 Bxe6\n- Qxe6 fxe6\n- dxe5 d4 (trying to open the center)\n- White has a strong passed pawn on e6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **e5e6** is the most aggressive and opens lines against Black's king, taking advantage of Black's lack of development and the king in the center.\n\nMy move is:\n```\ne5e6\n```"
