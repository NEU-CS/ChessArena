When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White plays Rb1, then ...Nxa1 Qxa1, Black has exchanged a knight for a rook, but White's bishops remain strong.\n- ...c5 is a thematic break, but after dxc5, bxc5, White can play e5, and the knight on f6 is still pinned and under pressure.\n- ...Rae8 brings another defender to the e-file, but doesn't solve the pin.\n- ...Qxe4+ is risky, as the queen could get trapped after Qe2.\n- ...h6 is dangerous, as after Bxf6+ Qxf6, White's queen can come to g4 with tempo.\n\n**Best move:**\n\nAfter careful consideration, ...Nb3 is the most forcing and concrete move. It attacks the rook and threatens to exchange off a defender. If White plays Rb1, then ...Nxa1 Qxa1, Black gets the exchange, and the pressure on f6 is reduced. If White ignores and plays e5, then ...Nxa1 Qxa1 dxe5, and Black is up material.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na5b3\n```"
