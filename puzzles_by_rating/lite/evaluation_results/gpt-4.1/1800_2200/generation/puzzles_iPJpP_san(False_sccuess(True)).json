No immediate checks.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. e7-e8=Q Qxf4+ (forced, otherwise White is up a queen)\n2. gxf4 (recapture)\n3. Ra1+ (Black tries to check)\n4. Kd2 (only move)\n5. Rxd1+ (Black tries to trade)\n6. Kxd1\n\nWhite is up a full queen for a rook and should be winning.\n\n**Alternative moves:**\n- Qf4-h6+ is a check, but Black can play Kf7 and White has no immediate mate.\n- Qf4-c7+ is a check, but Black can play Kg6.\n- Qf4-f6 is a queen trade, but White is winning after e7-e8=Q.\n- e7-e8=Q is the most forcing and decisive move.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to promote the pawn to a queen.\n\n```\ne7e8q\n```"

This doesn't seem to change much, but it may allow the king to escape checks or connect the rooks.\n2. **b2c3:** Pawn captures rook on c3. This is a huge material gain, as White captures a rook for a pawn.\n\n**Tactical check:**  \n- Is b2c3 safe? After b2c3, Black could try to check with Ra1+ or Qc3, but White's king is relatively safe on c1/d2, and White has two queens and two rooks. Capturing the rook is a massive gain.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to capture the rook with the pawn.\n\n```\nb2c3\n```"
