When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If hxg3, then Rxf1 is possible, but White can respond with Qf6+ or Qg7#.\n2. **h1h5+**: Rook to h5 check. If Kf4, then Qxg5 is possible, but White can play Qxh5+.\n3. **f8f4+**: Rook to f4 check. But f4 is not a legal move.\n4. **f8g8**: Rook to g8, defending g7. But then White can play Qxg6, threatening mate again.\n5. **e5g7**: Queen to g7, blocking mate, but White can capture with hxg7+ or Qxg7+.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **h1h5+** is the most forcing, as it gives check and forces the White king to move. Let's see the lines:\n\n1. h1h5+ Kf4 (only move)\n   - Now Qxg5 is possible, but then White can play Nxg6+ or Qxg5.\n   - If Qxg5+, then Kf4, but White is still threatening mate.\n\n2. h1h5+ Kf4 Qxg5+ Ke4 (only move)\n   - Now, Black can try Qxe7, but White is still very active.\n\nAlternatively, **e5xg3+**:\n- hxg3 Rxf1\n- Kf4 (only move), then Qxg5+.\n\nBut after hxg3, White is still threatening mate.\n\n**But what about Qxg3+?**\n- If hxg3, Rxf1, then White can play Qf6+ or Qg7#.\n\n**Is there any way to stop mate?**\n- **f8g8**: Rook to g8, defending g7.\n  - White plays Qxg6, threatening mate on g7 again.\n  - Black can play Qxe7, but then Qxg8+ Rxg8 hxg7+ Rxg7 hxg7+ Kxg7, and Black is down material.\n\n**But the only way to avoid immediate mate is to give check.**\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh1h5\n```"
