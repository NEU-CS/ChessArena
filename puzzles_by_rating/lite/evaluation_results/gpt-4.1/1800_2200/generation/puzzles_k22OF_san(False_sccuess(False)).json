When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's knight on f6 is well-placed, but White's king is active.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f6g8: Retreats the knight, but doesn't threaten anything.\n2. f6e8: Retreats the knight, but doesn't threaten anything.\n3. f6h7: Moves knight to the rim, not ideal.\n4. f6d7: Knight to d7, attacks c5 pawn, but White can defend.\n5. f6d5: Knight to d5, attacks c3 and e3, but White's king can take on e5.\n6. f6g4: Knight to g4, attacks h2 and e3, but White can play fxg4.\n7. f6e4: Knight to e4, attacks c3 and g3, but White can play Bxe4+.\n8. c6d7: King to d7, centralizes king, but doesn't threaten much.\n9. c6c7: King to c7, not active.\n10. c6b7: King to b7, not active.\n11. e5e4: Pawn push, attacks f3, but White can play Bxe4+.\n\nLet's consider the most forcing moves:\n\n- f6d5: Knight to d5, attacks c3 and e3, but White can play Bxe4, and after Kxc5, Black is down a piece.\n- f6g4: Knight to g4, attacks h2 and e3, but White can play fxg4.\n- f6d7: Knight to d7, attacks c5, but White can defend with Bf5.\n- e5e4: Pawn push, attacks f3, but White can play Bxe4+.\n\nThe best move seems to be:\n- f6d7: This attacks the c5 pawn and keeps the knight active. If White plays Bf5, then Black can consider Nxc5, and if Kb5, then Nb7.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6d7\n```"
