The king is centralized, and the knight can jump to squares that attack the pawns or support the king.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e4f6: King attacks the g5 pawn, but Black can push f4 or g4.\n2. e4d6: King moves away from the pawns, not ideal.\n3. e4g5: King captures pawn, but then f4 check, king must move, and Black can push the other pawn.\n4. d4f5: Knight attacks g7, but not possible (illegal).\n5. d4e2: Knight moves away, not useful.\n6. d4f3: Knight attacks g5, but not possible (illegal).\n7. d4e6: Knight attacks f4, but not possible (illegal).\n\nAmong the legal moves, the most promising is:\n- e4f6: King attacks the g5 pawn, and if Black pushes f4, White can play knight e6+ or king g5.\n\nLet's check e4f6:\n1. e4f6 f4\n2. Knight moves (e.g., d4e6+), Black king moves, White can try to capture pawns.\n\nAlternatively, e4g5 captures the pawn immediately:\n1. e4g5 f4\n2. Knight moves, but Black's f-pawn is dangerous.\n\nBut after e4g5 f4, White can play knight e6+:\n- e4g5 f4\n- d4e6+ Ke4 (forced)\n- Nxf4 (captures pawn)\n\nNow, White is up a piece and should win.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne4g5\n```"

The only Black pawn is on g5, and Black's king is on f5. White's king is on d4.\n\nObjective: White must stop Black's pawn from queening, and ideally win the pawn to force a draw (since with only kings, it's a draw).\n\nFirst, let's see if White can approach the pawn in time.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- d4e5: King moves closer to the pawn.\n- d4d5: King moves forward, but not toward the pawn.\n- d4c5: King moves toward the center, but away from the pawn.\n- d4c4, d4e3, d4d3, d4c3: All move away from the pawn or do not approach it efficiently.\n\nThe best move is to approach the pawn as quickly as possible. The fastest route is d4e5, heading toward g5.\n\nLet's check if Black can keep the pawn after d4e5:\n1. d4e5 Kg4 (protecting the pawn)\n2. Ke4 (approaching)\n3. ... Kf3 (if Black tries to shield the pawn)\n4. Kf5 (attacking the pawn directly)\n\nWhite will be able to capture the pawn or force a draw.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd4e5\n```"
