When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

But does not address the threat of White castling and increasing pressure.\n- **f6d7:** Retreats the knight, but loses central control and may allow White to continue development with tempo.\n- **e5d7:** Trades off the knight for the bishop, but after Bxd7+ Qxd7, White can castle and have a lead in development.\n- **e5c6:** Attacks the bishop on b5, but after Bxc6+ bxc6, White can play h3, kicking the bishop, or castle.\n- **g4d7:** Bishop takes on d7, but after Bxd7+ Qxd7, White can castle and have a comfortable position.\n\n**Deeper analysis:**\n- The move **e5c6** attacks the bishop, forcing White to decide. If Bxc6+ bxc6, Black has doubled pawns but opens the b-file for rook activity. White's king is still in the center. If the bishop retreats, Black can play a6 and b5, gaining space on the queenside.\n\n- The move **d8d7** is solid, but passive.\n\n- The move **e5d7** simplifies, but White's development advantage remains.\n\n**Best move:**\nThe most dynamic move is **e5c6**, attacking the bishop and forcing a decision. It also prepares to recapture with the b-pawn, opening the b-file for rook activity and possibly giving Black counterplay.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne5c6\n```"
