When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The best way is to play N(e7)xg6, so Black should try to keep the knight on f4 to prevent this.\n\nIf Black plays f4e6, White can play Nxg6, and after N(g6)xg7, White threatens f8=Q. If Black plays d7e8, White plays Nxg6, and again threatens f8=Q.\n\nBut if Black plays f4d5+, White must move the king, and then Black can play Nxf6, removing the dangerous pawn.\n\nLet's check f4d5+:\n1. ... Nf4-d5+  \n2. Kxd5 (illegal, king can't capture knight)  \n2. K moves (e.g., Kd4, Ke4, Ke6, Kd6)  \nBut after K moves, Black can play Nxf6, capturing the dangerous f7 pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf4d5\n```"
