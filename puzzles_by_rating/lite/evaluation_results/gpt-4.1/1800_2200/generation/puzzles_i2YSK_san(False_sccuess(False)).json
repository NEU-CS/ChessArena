When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed.\n\nTactical ideas:\n- The Black king is on e7, and the queen on h6 is very active.\n- The move Qxf6+ is possible, but after Kxf6, White loses the queen.\n- The move Qh8 is check, but Black can block with Rg8.\n- The move Qh7+ forces Kf8, but then Qh8 is not mate due to Rg8.\n- The move Qf4 is possible, threatening Qxf6+ and Qxc7.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Qh7+ (forces Kf8, but no immediate follow-up)\n2. Qh8 (forces Rg8, then Qxg8 Rxg8, Kf2, but White loses the queen for two rooks)\n3. Qf4 (threatens Qxc7 and Qxf6+)\n4. dxe6 (opens the e-file, but after fxe6, nothing immediate)\n5. d6+ (forces cxd6, but then Qxf6+ is possible)\n6. h5 (prepares h6, but slow)\n7. e4 (opens the center, but Black's king is still safe for now)\n\nLet's calculate Qh7+:\n- Qh7+ Kf8 (forced)\n- Qh8 Qxh8 (if Rg8, then Qxg8+ Kxg8, Kxg2, White is up a rook and a pawn for a queen, not enough)\n- So after Qh7+ Kf8, no immediate follow-up.\n\nWhat about Qf4?\n- Qf4 threatens Qxc7 and Qxf6+.\n- If Black plays Rg1+ (Rg2), then Ke2, and White is safe.\n\nWhat about d6+?\n- d6+ cxd6 (forced)\n- Qxf6+ Kxf6, White loses the queen.\n\nWhat about h5?\n- h5 is slow.\n\nWhat about c3e4?\n- c3e4 attacks the rook on g3 and the knight on b4, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n\nWhat about e3e4?\n- e4 opens the center, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n\nWhat about Qh8?\n- Qh8 Rg8\n- Qxg8 Rxg8, White loses the queen for two rooks.\n\nWhat about Qh6f4?\n- Qf4 threatens Qxc7 and Qxf6+.\n- If Black plays Qg2+, then Ke1, and White is safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh6f4\n```"
