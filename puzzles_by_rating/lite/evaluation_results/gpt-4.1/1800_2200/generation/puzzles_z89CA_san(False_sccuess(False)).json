When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's rook is defensive, and Black's king is not very active.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Rook moves: b4b8, b4b7, b4b6, b4b5, b4c4, b4a4, b4b3, b4b2, b4b1\n- King moves: g3h4, g3g4, g3f4, g3h3, g3g2\n- Pawn moves: d4d5, f3f4, h2h3, h2h4\n\nLet's consider the best plan:\n- The rook on b4 is well placed, but could become more active by invading the 7th or 8th rank.\n- d4d5 is a strong candidate, gaining space and possibly opening lines.\n- King moves (f3f4, g3f4) could help centralize, but may allow Black counterplay.\n- h2h3 is a waiting move, but not ambitious.\n\nLet's look at d4d5:\n- d4d5 attacks the rook on d6. If Black plays exd5, White can recapture with the rook, activating it further.\n- If Black ignores, White can push d6, creating a passed pawn.\n\nLet's look at b4b7:\n- Invading the 7th rank, attacking g7 and f7 pawns. Black could defend with Rd7, but then White can double on the 7th rank.\n\nLet's look at b4b8:\n- Invading the 8th rank, but there are no immediate threats.\n\nBetween d4d5 and b4b7, d4d5 is more forcing and challenges Black immediately.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nd4d5\n```"
