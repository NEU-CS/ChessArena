When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black plays h5, then gxh6 and White gets a passed pawn. If hxg5, then f4xg5 and White's king can support the advance.\n- e3f3 is also strong, centralizing the king and supporting the kingside pawns.\n- h4h5 is less effective because after gxh5, White's kingside majority is less mobile.\n\n**Let's calculate g4g5:**\n- 1. g4g5 hxg5 (forced, otherwise gxh6 is strong)\n- 2. f4g5 h5 (trying to hold)\n- 3. e3f4 (centralizing king)\n- White can try to create a passed pawn with h4-h5 next.\n\nAlternatively, after 1. g4g5, if Black plays h5, then gxh6 and White has a passed pawn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is to play g4g5, breaking up Black's kingside structure and preparing to create a passed pawn.\n\nFinal move:\n```\ng4g5\n```"
