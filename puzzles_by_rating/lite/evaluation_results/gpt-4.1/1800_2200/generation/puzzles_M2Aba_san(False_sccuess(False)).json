When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Dangerous.\n2. **f6e4**: Exchanges off a dangerous knight, but after Qxe4, White centralizes the queen and increases pressure.\n3. **c6e5**: Attacks the g5 knight and centralizes the knight. If Nxf6+ Bxf6, White has no immediate threat. If f4, then Nc6.\n4. **b5b4**: Gains space, but doesn't address the kingside tension.\n5. **e6e5**: Kicks the knight, but after Nxf6+ Bxf6, White can play f4, gaining space.\n6. **d8d1**: Rook exchange, but after Rxd1, White's pieces are more active.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **c6e5** stands out. It attacks the g5 knight, centralizes the knight, and if White exchanges on f6, Black can recapture with the bishop, keeping the kingside solid. It also opens the c6 square for the queen or bishop in the future.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nc6e5\n```"
