When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's bishop on h3 is also eyeing the e6 square.\n- Black's king is relatively safe for now, but White has some attacking chances.\n- Black's rook on c7 is well placed, and the rook on g4 is active.\n- Black's bishop on d3 is strong, controlling key diagonals.\n\n**Immediate tactical considerations:**\n- White threatens to play Bxe6, attacking the rook on c7 and threatening mate ideas.\n- The pawn on f6 is close to queening, but currently blocked by Black's king.\n- Black can consider rook moves to harass White's king or defend.\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n1. **g4g8**: Rook to g8, defending the back rank and possibly preparing to double rooks.\n2. **c7c2**: Rook to c2, attacking the a2 pawn and threatening to invade the second rank.\n3. **d3f5**: Bishop to f5, attacking the rook on h3 and defending e6.\n4. **g4g6**: Rook to g6, attacking the bishop on h3.\n5. **d3e4**: Bishop to e4, centralizing and attacking the rook on h5.\n6. **c7c3**: Rook to c3, attacking the bishop on h3.\n\n**Tactical checks:**\n- If Black plays **g4g8**, White can play Bxe6, but after Rc1, Black can threaten mate on h1.\n- If Black plays **d3f5**, White's rook on h5 is attacked, and the bishop covers e6.\n- If Black plays **g4g6**, White's bishop is attacked, but White can play Rh8+ and then Bxe6.\n\n**Deep calculation:**\n- After **d3f5**, if White plays Bxf5, exf5, the rook on h5 is attacked and the pawn on f6 is defended.\n- If White plays Rh8+, Kf7, Rh7+ Bxh7, f4, Black is still up material.\n\n**Best move:**\n**d3f5** attacks the rook on h3, defends e6, and keeps control. It also threatens to exchange off White's dangerous bishop.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd3f5\n```"
