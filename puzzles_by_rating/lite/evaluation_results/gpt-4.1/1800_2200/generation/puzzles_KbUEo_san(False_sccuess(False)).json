When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White plays gxh3, then Black's king can try to invade via the center or queenside. If White ignores, Black can push h2 and threaten to promote.\n- **c7c5:** This move tries to create a passed pawn on the queenside, but White's king is closer to the queenside.\n- **a7a5/a7a6:** These moves try to slow down White's a-pawn, but White can just push a5 or a6 in response.\n- **King moves:** Moving the king doesn't seem to help much, as White's king is more active.\n\n**Critical line:**\n- If h4h3, White's best is probably gxh3, then Black can try to activate the king or push c5.\n- If c7c5, White can play a5, and after cxd4, f5, White's king is very active.\n\n**Best chance for Black:** The h-pawn is the furthest advanced and can create immediate problems for White. Forcing White to capture on h3 may distract the White king or create a passed pawn.\n\n**Final decision:** Push the h-pawn to h3.\n\n```\nh4h3\n```"
