When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

After ...Nxe8, White can continue with Bxb7, winning material.\n2. **Qxh7+ (h5h7):** Grabs a pawn with check, but after ...Nxh7, White loses the queen.\n3. **Bxh7 (e4h7):** Bishop takes pawn, but after ...Nxh7, White loses a bishop for a pawn.\n4. **Bxb7 (e4b7):** Bishop takes pawn, but Black can respond with Qxb7.\n5. **Qf7 (h5f7):** Queen attacks f7, but not a check and doesn't threaten much.\n6. **Rd3 (d1d3):** Prepares to double rooks or defend c4.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **Qxe8+ (h5e8)**: This wins a full rook with check. After ...Nxe8, White can continue with Bxb7, winning another pawn and threatening to win more material. Black's king remains exposed, and White's pieces are very active.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh5e8\n```"
