When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Let's calculate:\n   - 1. Rxf7+ Rxf7 (if Kg8, then Qg5+ wins the rook on b8)\n   - 2. Qf4+ (threatening mate on f7 and f8)\n   - But after Rxf7, Black's king is still exposed.\n\n2. **Qf4+**: Immediate check.\n   - 1. Qf4+ Ke8 (if Kg8, then Qg5+ and mate threats)\n   - 2. Qxf7+ Kd8, but Black escapes.\n\n3. **Qh6**: Threatening mate on g7.\n   - 1. Qh6+ Ke8 (if Kg8, then Qg5+)\n   - 2. Qc6 (defending g7), but White can continue attack.\n\n4. **Bxe4**: Capturing the knight, but loses momentum.\n\n5. **Bishop moves**: Not forcing.\n\n**Best Forcing Move:**\n- **Rxf7+** is the most forcing, as it exposes Black's king and opens lines for White's queen and bishop.\n\nLet's calculate:\n1. Rxf7+ Rxf7 (if Kg8, then Qg5+ and mate)\n2. Qf4+ Ke8 (if Kg8, Qg5+ and mate)\n3. Qxf7+ Kd8\n4. Qxd5+ (winning material and keeping the attack)\n\nAlternatively, after Rxf7+ Kg8:\n- Qg5+ Nxg5 (forced)\n- Qxg5+ Kh8\n- Qg7#\n\nBut after Rxf7+ Kg8, Qg5+ is mate in a few.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n- 1. Rxf7+ Kg8\n- 2. Qg5+ Nxg5\n- 3. Qxg5+ Kh8\n- 4. Qg7#\n\nSo, **Rxf7+** leads to forced mate.\n\n**Best Move:**\n```\nf1f7\n```"
