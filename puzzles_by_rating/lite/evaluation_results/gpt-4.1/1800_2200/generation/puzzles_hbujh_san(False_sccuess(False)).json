When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

After that, White can consider Rb7 or Qg4.\n2. e3g2 (Knight to g2): Defends h4 and f4, but blocks the rook.\n3. Rb8h8: Rook to h8, but doesn't threaten much.\n4. d3d4: Opens the center, but may be too slow.\n5. g3g4: Weakens the king, not recommended.\n6. f1e1: Rook move, but doesn't address threats.\n\nLet's calculate 1. Qg7+:\n- 1. Qg7+ Kg6 (forced)\n- Now, White can play Rb7, threatening Qg4+ and Qxf3, or even Qg4+ immediately.\n\nAlternatively, 1. Qb7 is possible, but Qg7+ is more forcing.\n\nLet's check for any tactics for Black after Qg7+ Kg6:\n- If White plays Qg4+, Black can block with Kf6 or Kh6, but then White can take on f3 with check.\n\nSo, 1. Qg7+ looks very strong.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb2g7\n```"
