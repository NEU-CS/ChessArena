When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is active, and the g3 pawn is close to promotion as well. The rook on h2 is well placed to support the g3 pawn or check the White king.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g3g2: Pushes the pawn, threatening to promote. If White takes with the rook (Rh2xg2), Black can try to check with the rook or advance the king.\n2. h2h7: Rook to h7, but that's not possible since White's rook is already there.\n3. e3f4: King moves closer to the White king, but doesn't address the pawn race.\n4. h2g2: Rook to g2, attacking the White king and threatening to promote the g3 pawn.\n\nLet's look at g3g2:\n- If g3g2, White can play g7g8=Q, but Black can play g2g1=Q, and after Rook takes on g1, Black can recapture with the rook. But White's rook is on h7, so after g2g1=Q, White can play Rh8, but that's not check. Black is queening with check if the king is on g1.\n\nAlternatively, h2g2+:\n- h2g2+ forces the White king to h1, then g3g2 threatens mate with Rg1#.\n\nLet's calculate h2g2+:\n1. ... h2g2+\n2. Kg1 (forced)\n3. g3g2\n\nNow, White cannot stop g2g1=Q#, because the rook on g2 covers the g1 square. White's rook on h7 is too far to help.\n\nTherefore, h2g2+ is a forced mate in a few moves.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nh2g2\n```"
