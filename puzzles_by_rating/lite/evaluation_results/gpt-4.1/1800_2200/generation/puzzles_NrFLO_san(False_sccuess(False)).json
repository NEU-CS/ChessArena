When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a king on f5 and pawns on d6, c5, and g6.\n- White's pawns are very advanced, especially d6 and g6. The c5 pawn is also close to promotion.\n- Black's bishop is on g7, which can control some promotion squares, but the king is cut off from the queenside.\n- White threatens to promote soon, especially with d6-d7 or c5-c6.\n- Black's only hope is to use the bishop to stop the pawns or try to sacrifice for two pawns and reach a drawn endgame.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Moving the bishop: g7h8, g7f8, g7h6, g7f6, g7e5, g7d4, g7c3, g7b2, g7a1.\n- Moving the king: d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7c6.\n\nLet's consider the best defensive resource:\n\n1. If the bishop moves away from the g7 diagonal, White can play c6+ and d7, and the pawns will promote.\n2. If the bishop goes to e5, it attacks the g3 pawn, but that's not relevant.\n3. If the bishop goes to f8, it keeps an eye on c5 and d6, but White can still advance.\n4. If the king moves to c6, it attacks the c5 pawn, but after Ke6, White will promote the d-pawn.\n\nThe best try is to play:\n- d7c6, attacking the c5 pawn and trying to sacrifice the bishop for two pawns.\n\nLet's check if this holds:\n1. ... Kc6\n2. Ke6 (threatening d7)\n   - If ... Bf8, then d7, and White will promote.\n   - If ... Kxc5, then d7, and White will promote.\n\nAlternatively, try to keep the king close to the pawns.\n\nBut after d7c6, White can play Ke6, and after Kxc5, d7, and the bishop can't stop both pawns.\n\nAlternatively, try to keep the bishop on the diagonal to control promotion squares.\n\nBut all lines seem lost for Black, but the best try is to play d7c6.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd7c6\n```"
