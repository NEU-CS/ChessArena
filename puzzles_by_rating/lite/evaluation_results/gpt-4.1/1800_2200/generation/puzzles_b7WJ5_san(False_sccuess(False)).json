When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's queen is on d6, bishop on d4, and a dangerous passed pawn on f6. Black's king is on h6, somewhat exposed. Black has a queen on b3 and pawns on f7, g5, h4, b4.\n- White's king is on e1, relatively safe for now.\n- Black's queen on b3 is active and can give checks or harass White's king.\n- Black's king is in danger of back rank mates or perpetual checks, but White's queen and bishop are well coordinated.\n- Black's only real chance is to give perpetual checks or try to force a draw, as White's threats are overwhelming (f6-f7-f8=Q is coming, and Qf8# is a threat if the Black king moves).\n\n**Candidate moves:**\n- h6h7: Moves the king to h7, but White can play Qf8 and mate soon.\n- h6g6: King to g6, but Qf8 is mate.\n- h6h5: King to h5, but White can play Qf8, and after Kg6, Qg7#.\n- g5g4: Pawn push, but doesn't stop White's threats.\n- b3e6: Queen to e6, attacking the bishop and possibly threatening Qe1+.\n- b3d1: Queen to d1, check, but White can block with Kf2 or Kf1.\n- b3b1: Queen to b1+, check, but White can block with Kf2 or Kf1.\n\n**Best defensive try:**\n- The only way to avoid immediate mate is to give checks or threaten perpetual. Let's check if b3b1+ or b3d1+ gives any hope.\n\n1. b3b1+ Kf2 (forced)\n2. ... Qc2+ (only check)\n3. Ke3 (forced)\n4. ... Qc1+ (only check)\n5. Kf2 (cycle repeats)\n\nSo, Black can force a perpetual check with b3b1+.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best move is to start the perpetual check sequence.\n\n```\nb3b1\n```"
