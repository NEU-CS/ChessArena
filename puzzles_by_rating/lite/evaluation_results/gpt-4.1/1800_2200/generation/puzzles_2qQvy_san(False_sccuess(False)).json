When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

After Bxf3, Black can play Nxf3+ again, but that's not possible since the knight is gone.\n- If Nxf3+ Bxf3, Black can play Nxf3+ (not possible), so that's not a sequence.\n- If Nxf3+ Bxf3, Black can play c5, attacking the queen and bishop.\n\n**Let's calculate Nxf3+:**\n1. ... Nxf3+ \n2. Bxf3 (if gxf3, White's king is exposed)\n   - Now, c5 attacks the queen and bishop.\n   - If Qd3, then d5 is possible, gaining space.\n   - If Qe3, then d5 is possible.\n   - If Qc3, then d5.\n\nAlternatively, after Nxf3+ Bxf3, Black can play d5, attacking the queen and opening the center.\n\n**What about immediate c5?**\n- c5 Qxe4 Nxf3+ Qxf3 d5, but White is up a pawn.\n\n**What about f5?**\n- f5 Nxe5 dxe5 Qxe5, White wins a pawn.\n\n**What about Nc6?**\n- Nc6 Qxe4, White wins a pawn.\n\n**What about Nxf3+?**\n- Nxf3+ Bxf3 c5 (threatening cxd4 and cxd4), but White can play Qd3.\n\n**What about d5?**\n- d5 Nxe5 dxe4 Qxe4, White wins a pawn.\n\n**What about Nxf3+ gxf3?**\n- Nxf3+ gxf3 c5, White's king is exposed, but White can play Qe3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most forcing move is **Nxf3+**. It forces White to recapture, and then Black can play c5, gaining tempo on the queen and bishop. This gives Black initiative and opens lines against White's king.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne5f3\n```"
