When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White plays Ke3, Black can play Kxf6 and win the pawn.\n- If 1...f7e5, Black centralizes the knight and attacks c4 and f3.\n- If 1...a4a3, Black pushes the passed pawn, but White can play Bd4 or c5+.\n- If 1...e4e3, Black threatens exf2+ and e2, but White can play Kxe3.\n\n**Best move:**\nThe most direct way to stop White's f6 pawn is to attack it with the king. The move 1...Ke6 attacks the f6 pawn and threatens to capture it. If White tries to defend with Ke3, Black can play Kxf6. If White tries to push c5+, Black can play Kxf6 as well.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd6e6\n```"
