When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's queen and rook are coordinated, but there is no immediate mate threat.\n- White can play e2e5, attacking the queen and possibly winning material.\n- h3f4 attacks the rook on f3, which is only defended by the queen on d6.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- After h3f4, if Black plays Rxf4, Qxf4, Qxf4, Rxf4, White is up a rook.\n- After h3f4, if Black moves the rook, White has a strong position and can continue to attack.\n- e2e5 attacks the queen, but after fxe5, White loses a rook.\n\n**Best move:**\n- h3f4 is a strong move, attacking the rook and threatening to win material.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nh3f4\n```"
