The king is also less exposed to checks from the rook on h3.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne3f4\n```"

Black can try ...Rh5+ to check, but after Kf6, White is threatening e7-e8=Q. Black's rook is far from the action, and White's bishops control the queening square.\n- **f4g3, f4f3, f4e3:** All retreat the king and lose momentum.\n\n**Tactics:**\n- After f4e5, if Black tries ...Rh5+ Kf6, the e-pawn is unstoppable.\n- If Black tries ...g5, White can play e7, and the pawn is still unstoppable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best move is to centralize the king and support the e-pawn's advance.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nf4e5\n```"
