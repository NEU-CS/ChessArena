When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black could play Qb2+ or Qxc3, threatening the king and possibly picking up material.\n\n2. **a4a5 (King to a5):**\n   - King moves to a5, but this is dangerous. The king is exposed and could be checked by Black's queen or rook.\n\n3. **a4b3 (King to b3):**\n   - King moves to b3, slightly safer, but still exposed.\n\n4. **d5b5 (Queen to b5):**\n   - Queen moves to b5, possibly threatening mate on b8, but Black can defend with Qb1+ or Qc2+.\n\n5. **c4b5 (Bishop captures b5):**\n   - Bishop captures b5, attacking the rook on g6 and threatening to win material. Also, this opens the a-file for the king to escape if needed.\n\n**Tactical considerations:**\n- c4b5 is the most aggressive and promising move. It wins a pawn, attacks the rook, and keeps the initiative. After c4b5, if Black plays axb4, White can play cxb4, keeping the position closed and safe for the king.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\nc4b5\n```"
