When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is relatively safe for now, but Black's pawns are threatening to advance.\n\nImmediate threats:  \n- Black's c4, b4, a4 pawns are very advanced and could create a passed pawn.\n- White's rooks are active, but not coordinated for an immediate attack.\n- White's bishop on d1 eyes the a4 pawn, but is otherwise passive.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f3h3: Rook to h3, attacking h1 rook, but Black can play Rxh3.\n2. f3g3: Rook to g3, attacking g6 pawn.\n3. f3e3: Rook to e3, attacking e6 pawn.\n4. f3d3: Rook to d3, attacking d4 pawn.\n5. f2h2: Rook to h2, attacking h1 rook.\n6. b2b3: Pawn to b3, trying to break up Black's queenside pawns.\n\nLet's consider the most promising options:\n\n- f3g3: Attacks g6, but after ...Rh2, White's king is in danger of back rank mate.\n- f3e3: Attacks e6, but again, ...Rh1+ is dangerous.\n- f2h2: Rook to h2, threatening to exchange rooks and relieve back rank pressure. If ...Rxh2, Bxa4 and White wins a pawn and relieves pressure.\n- b2b3: Tries to break up the queenside, but after ...axb3, axb3, cxb3, White's queenside collapses.\n\nThe move f2h2 stands out: it offers to exchange rooks, which would relieve the back rank pressure and allow White to play more freely. If Black refuses the exchange, White can double on the h-file or play Rh7, threatening mate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf2h2\n```"
