When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's pieces are very active, especially the rooks on the 7th and 3rd ranks. Black's king is exposed on h6, and White has attacking chances.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- g7g8: Rook to 8th rank, but doesn't threaten much immediately.\n- g7h7: Rook to h7, threatening mate on h5, but Black can defend with Bg6.\n- g7f7: Rook to f7, attacking the bishop on f7.\n- g3g6: Rook to g6+, check, forcing the king to h7 or h5.\n- e1f2: King to f2, but not urgent.\n- e1e2: King to e2, not urgent.\n\nTactical ideas:\n- g3g6+ is a forcing move. If ...Bxg6, then Rxg6# is mate.\n- If ...Kh7, then Rg7g7 threatens mate on g7.\n- If ...Kh5, then Rg7g5# is mate.\n\nLet's check g3g6+:\n\n1. g3g6+ Kh7 (if Kh5, then Rg7g5# is mate)\n2. Rg7g7+ Kh8 (if Kh8, then Rg8# is mate)\n3. Rg8# is mate.\n\nSo after 1. g3g6+, Black's king is in a mating net.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng3g6\n```"
