When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is somewhat centralized, but White's king is also active. The knight on c5 is well-placed, controlling key squares.\n\nImmediate threats:\n- White threatens to push e7, and if Black does nothing, e7-e8=Q is coming.\n- Black must stop the e6 pawn.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e7f8: King steps back, but doesn't help much.\n2. e7e8: King to e8, blocks pawn but allows f6, and White can try to maneuver.\n3. c5e6: Knight attacks e6 pawn, but fxe6 is not possible (White pawn is on e6). But after c5e6, White can play fxe6, but that's not legal.\n4. c5b7: Knight to b7, not relevant.\n5. c5d7: Knight to d7, attacks e5 and covers e8.\n6. c5e4: Knight to e4, attacks f6 and g3, but White can still push e7.\n7. e7f6: King to f6, attacks e6 pawn directly.\n\nLet's look at e7f6:\n- If 44...Kf6, then 45.e7 Kxe7 46.Kg5 and White is threatening f6 and f7. But Black can try to hold.\n\nWhat about c5d7:\n- 44...Nd7 covers e8, so after 45.exd7 Kxd7, White's pawn is gone, and Black is only down a bishop for two pawns, but White's king is active.\n\nWhat about c5e4:\n- 44...Ne4, White can play e7, and after Kxe7, Kxe4, but Black is still down.\n\nWhat about e7e8:\n- 44...Ke8, White plays f6, and Black is in trouble.\n\nBest move: 44...Nd7 seems to be the best defense, as it covers e8 and attacks the e6 pawn.\n\nFinal move:\n```\nc5d7\n```"
