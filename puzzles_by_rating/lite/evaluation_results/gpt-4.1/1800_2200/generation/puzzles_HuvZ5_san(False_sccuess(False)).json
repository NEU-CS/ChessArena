When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's pieces are somewhat passive except for the queen and rook. White has a space advantage and the bishop pair.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- f3xc6: Bishop takes on c6, attacking the rook on f6 and threatening to win material.\n- f3h5: Bishop to h5, attacking the rook and possibly threatening g3 to trap the queen.\n- d3d4: Opens the center, but Black's pieces are well placed to respond.\n- a3a4: Expands on the queenside, but not urgent.\n- g2g3: Attacks the queen, but Black can play Qh3 or Qg5.\n- f3g4: Bishop to g4, attacks the rook and covers h5.\n- d1g4: Not a legal move.\n\nLet's look at f3xc6:\n1. f3xc6 Bxc6 (if Black recaptures)\n2. d4 (opens the center, threatens d5)\nBut after f3xc6, Black can also play Rh6, defending the bishop and keeping the rook active.\n\nWhat about f3h5?\n1. f3h5 Rh6 (forced)\n2. g3 (attacks the queen)\n3. Qh3 (forced)\n4. g4 (traps the queen, but h5 is now hanging)\nBut after g3, Black can play Qg5, and the queen escapes.\n\nWhat about d3d4?\n1. d3d4 exd4\n2. Bxd4 (attacks the queen)\nBut then Qg5, and Black is fine.\n\nWhat about g2g3?\n1. g2g3 Qg5\n2. Bc1 (defends h3)\nBut then Qf5, and the queen is still active.\n\nWhat about f3g4?\n1. f3g4 Rh6 (defends h5)\n2. h3 (attacks the queen)\n3. Qg5 (queen escapes)\n\nWhat about f3e4?\n1. f3e4 (attacks h7, but not much else)\n\nWhat about f3d5?\n1. f3d5 (attacks c6 and e7, but c6 is defended)\n\nBest move:\nThe most forcing move is f3xc6, winning a pawn and threatening to win more material. Black's best response is Bxc6, but then White can play d4, opening the center with the bishop pair.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf3c6\n```"
