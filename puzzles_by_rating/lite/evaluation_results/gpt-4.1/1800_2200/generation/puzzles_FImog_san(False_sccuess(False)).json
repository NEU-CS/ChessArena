When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

But after ...Kh8, White can play Rxd7, but Black may defend.\n2. **d1d7**: Rook takes d7, attacking the queen and bishop, but Black can play Qd7.\n3. **g3g5**: Queen attacks the knight on h5, but it's not forcing.\n4. **g3e5**: Queen centralizes, attacks the knight and e5 pawn.\n5. **c4f7**: Bishop takes f7+, but after Rxf7, White loses the bishop.\n6. **g3g4**: Attacks the knight, but not very forcing.\n\n**Critical calculation:**\n- **g3g7**: If 14. Qxg7+ Nxg7 (forced), 15. Bxg7 Kxg7, 16. Rxd7 Qxd7, 17. Rd1 Qe7, and White is up a piece (since the knight on h5 is hanging), but let's check if that's true.\n- After Qxg7+ Nxg7, Bxg7 Kxg7, Rxd7 Qxd7, Rd1 Qe7, White can play Rd7, but Black can defend. But White is up material.\n\n**Is there a more forcing move?**\n- **g3g7** is very strong, as it wins material and keeps the attack going.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ng3g7\n```"
