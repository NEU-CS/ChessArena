When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

But after ...Qf6, Black can defend.\n2. **c7c8** (Rc8): Threatens to invade the 8th rank, but Black can play ...Rxc8, Qxc8+, Be8 and defend.\n3. **d4e5** (Qe5): Centralizes the queen, but doesn't create an immediate threat.\n4. **d4a7** (Qa7): Attacks b7 and pins the bishop, but Black can defend.\n5. **d6d7** (d7): Threatens d8=Q, but Black can play ...Qf6 or ...e5.\n6. **g2b7** (Bxb7): Captures a pawn, but not decisive.\n7. **d4f6** (Qf6): Attacks the bishop, but Black can play ...Qf6.\n\n**Critical lines:**\n- **d4g7+** Kxg7 d6-d7 Qf6 Qxf6+ Kxf6 Rxb7: White wins a piece and has a winning endgame.\n- **d4g7+** Kxg7 d6-d7 Nf3+ Bxf3 Qxf4: Black gets some counterplay, but White is still better.\n\n**Calculation for d4g7+:**\n1. Qxg7+ Kxg7\n2. d6-d7 Qf6 (only move to stop d8=Q)\n3. Qxf6+ Kxf6\n4. Rxb7\n\nWhite is up a piece and has a winning endgame.\n\n**Check for tactics:**\n- Is there any better move than Qxg7+?
