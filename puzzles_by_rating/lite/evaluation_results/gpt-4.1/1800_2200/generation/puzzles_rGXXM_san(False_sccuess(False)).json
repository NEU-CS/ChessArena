When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's rook on e8 is blocking promotion. Black's king is on f6, close to the action. White's king is on h4, far from the queenside. Black's b6 pawn is blockaded by the rook but could advance.\n\nImmediate threats:\n- White threatens e8=Q, but Black's rook is blocking.\n- White's rook on b7 is very active.\n- Black must prevent pawn promotion and seek counterplay.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e8e7: Rook blocks pawn, but allows White to double up with Rxb6+.\n2. e8h8: Rook swings to h-file, but White can play Rxb6+.\n3. f6f5: King steps up, but White can play Rxb6.\n4. b6b5: Pawn push, but White can play Rxb6.\n5. f6e6: King steps aside, but White can promote with e8=Q+.\n\nBest move:\n- The only way to stop the pawn from promoting is to keep the rook on the 8th rank.\n- Moving the rook along the 8th rank (e.g., e8h8) keeps the blockade and may allow lateral defense.\n- e8e7 allows White to exchange rooks and promote.\n- e8h8 keeps the rook active and may allow for counterplay along the h-file.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n```\ne8h8\n```"
