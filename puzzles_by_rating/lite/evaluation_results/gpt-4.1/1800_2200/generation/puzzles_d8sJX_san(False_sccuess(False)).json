After Qf4+ g3, the queen is attacked and must move.\n2. **c1f4+** Kg1, Qf7 (defending), but White can play Ng5.\n3. **c1c8** (Queen to c8): Defends the 8th rank, but White can play Qxe6.\n4. **d7f7** (Rook to f7): Defends the 7th rank, but White can play Ng5.\n5. **g7h7** (King to h7): Passive, and White can invade.\n6. **b7b6** or **b5b4**: Pushes pawns, but White is threatening too much.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **c1f4+** is the most forcing move, giving check and possibly buying time or forcing a perpetual if White's king is exposed.\n\nLet's check the consequences:\n\n1. **c1f4+**\n   - If Kg1, then Qf7 (defending the 7th rank).\n   - If g3, then Qxf3 (winning the knight).\n   - If Kh1, then Qf7 (again defending).\n\nAfter **c1f4+ g3**, Black wins the knight with Qxf3, so White cannot play g3.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc1f4+\n```"

If White exchanges queens, Black can recapture with the rook, and the d7 pawn is no longer protected by the queen, so Black can capture it next move. This neutralizes White's threats and wins material.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf4f8\n```"
