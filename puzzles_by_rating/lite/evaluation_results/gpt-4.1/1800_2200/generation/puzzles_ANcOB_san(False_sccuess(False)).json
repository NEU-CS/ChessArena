When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has two active rooks and a bishop, while Black's bishop on f7 is not very active. Black has a dangerous passed pawn on e2, but it is currently blockaded.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. h6h8 (Rook to h8, threatening mate on h4)\n2. h6h7 (Rook to h7, not threatening much)\n3. f3f4+ (Check, but Black can block or move)\n4. b4b5 (Pawn push, but doesn't threaten much)\n5. d1e2 (Bishop captures pawn, but loses the bishop to rook)\n6. f3h3 (Rook to h3, threatening mate on h4)\n7. h6g6 (Rook to g6, attacking bishop)\n8. f3f2 (Rook to f2, defending against e1=Q)\n\nThe most forcing move is f3f4+, which checks the king. Let's see what happens:\n- f3f4+ Kf5 (or Kg4)\n- Then h6h8, threatening mate on h4.\n\nAlternatively, h6h8 immediately threatens mate on h4, but Black can play Bxh5.\n\nBut if I play f3f4+, Black must move the king. If Kf5, then h6h8 threatens mate on h4, and Black can't stop it because the bishop is pinned.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf3f4\n```"
