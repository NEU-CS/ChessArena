Nxc6, Black must respond. If 23... Bxc6, then 24. bxc6, and White has a dangerous passed pawn on c6, and the bishop on d3 is very strong. If 23... Qxa3, then 24. Qxa3 Bxa3, White can play 25. Nxd8 Rxd8, and White is up a pawn with a strong position.\n- **e5g6**: 23. Ng6 fxg6 24. Bxg6, but Black can play Nf8, defending.\n- **c4c5**: 23. c5 bxc5 24. Nc6, but Black can play Qf8, defending.\n- **b3b4**: Prepares c5, but not as direct as Nxc6.\n\n**Best move:**\nAfter careful analysis, **23. Nxc6** looks the strongest. It wins a pawn, threatens the rook, and creates a dangerous passed pawn on c6. Black's pieces are tied up, and White's initiative grows.\n\n**Final move:**\n```\ne5c6\n```"

Bxh7+ Kxh7 2. Qh3+ Kg8 (forced), White can play bxc6, but Black's king is still exposed.\n- Alternatively, after Bxh7+, if Black declines the bishop, White can continue the attack.\n- The rook lift with e1e6 is also tempting, as it attacks the queen and threatens to double on the e-file.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. d3h7+ Kxh7\n2. Qh3+ Kg8\n3. bxc6 (threatening Qh8# if the bishop moves)\n   - If Nf6, then Bxf6 Qxf6, c7, and White is winning.\n   - If Qg5, then cxd7, and White is still pressing.\n\nAlternatively, if Black does not take the bishop, White has a strong attack.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe bishop sacrifice with Bxh7+ is very strong and opens up the Black king for a decisive attack. The rook lift is also strong, but the bishop sacrifice is more forcing.\n\nMy move:\n```\nd3h7\n```"
