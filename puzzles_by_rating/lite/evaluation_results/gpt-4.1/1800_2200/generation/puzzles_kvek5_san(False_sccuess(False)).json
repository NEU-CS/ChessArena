When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If ...Kxg6, then Nxe5+ forks king and rook.\n2. **g4h6**: Knight to h6, check, but Black can play ...Kg7 and the knight is trapped.\n3. **g3e5**: Bishop to e5, attacking the knight on d4 and possibly threatening discovered attacks.\n4. **b4b5**: Pawn push, attacking c6 and opening the b-file for the rook.\n5. **f2f3**: Supporting the e4 pawn, but not urgent.\n6. **g4f6**: Knight to f6, check, but Black can capture with the knight.\n7. **h4f5**: Knight to f5, attacking e7 and g7, but not as forcing.\n\n**Deep calculation:**\n- **h4g6**: If ...Kxg6, then Nxe5+ forks king and rook, winning material.\n- If ...Kg7, then Nf5+ forks king and rook, and if ...Kf7, then Nxe5+ again.\n- If ...Kg8, then Nxf6+ wins the exchange.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move **h4g6** is a powerful tactical blow, threatening a fork and exploiting the exposed king. It is the strongest move.\n\nMy move:\n```\nh4g6\n```"
