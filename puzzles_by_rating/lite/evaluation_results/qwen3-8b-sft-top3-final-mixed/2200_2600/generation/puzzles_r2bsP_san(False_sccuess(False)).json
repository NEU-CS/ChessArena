When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, rook, pawns. Black has queen, 2 rooks, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h7\n- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black's rooks are doubled on the e-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: d5g8 looks tempting as it threatens mate (Qg8#)\n- Rook moves: f1f5 could be strong, attacking the e5 pawn and opening lines\n- King moves: g2h3 gets the king to safety\n\n4. Calculating d5g8:\n- After Qg8#, it's checkmate! Black has no way to prevent this:\n  - The king can't move to h6 because of Qg6#\n  - The rook on f8 can't block\n  - The queen can't capture the queen\n\n5. Other queen moves don't lead to immediate mates, and some might even be bad (like d5d8 allowing Rxd8).\n\n6. The h-pawn push (h6) isn't as forcing as the queen mate.\n\nTherefore, the most decisive and winning move is:\n\n```\nd5g8\n```"
