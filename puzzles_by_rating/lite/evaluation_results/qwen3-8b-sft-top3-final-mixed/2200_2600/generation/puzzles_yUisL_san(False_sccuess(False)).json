When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on c3\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- White's queen on f3 is very active\n- Black's queen on e5 is under attack by White's rook on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c6c7: King moves forward but into potential checks\n- c6b6: King moves away from center but still exposed\n- c6c5: King moves forward but into potential danger\n- c6b5: King moves to corner, possibly safer\n- e7d5: Knight moves to defend queen\n- e5d5: Queen moves to safety\n- e5e4: Queen moves forward, attacking pawn\n\n4. Best options:\n- e5d5 seems most logical, getting the queen to safety while maintaining control\n- e5e4 is tempting but after Qxe4, Black's position becomes messy\n- King moves all leave the king exposed to future attacks\n\nAfter considering all options, e5d5 is the most solid move, protecting the queen while keeping the position balanced.\n\n```\ne5d5\n```"
