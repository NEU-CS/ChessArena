When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 2 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 6 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but Black's king is more exposed\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's king is on g4, very exposed\n   - White has a queen on c5 attacking the bishop on b7\n   - White has a bishop on d3 controlling important squares\n   - Black's queen is on b2, potentially threatening the white king\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - g4h5: King moves to h5 - but this walks into potential checks from White's rook or queen\n   - g4g5: King moves forward - this seems dangerous as it brings the king closer to White's pieces\n   - g4h4: King moves to h4 - this keeps the king more centralized but still exposed\n   - g4f4: King moves to f4 - this seems most promising as it:\n     * Gets the king away from the g-file where White's rook could potentially attack\n     * Moves toward the center where it might be safer\n     * Doesn't immediately walk into any discovered attacks\n\n4. The other moves seem riskier:\n   - g4h5 allows Rh1-h5+ next move\n   - g4g5 allows Qc5-g5+ winning the bishop\n   - g4h4 still leaves the king exposed to potential checks\n\nAfter careful consideration, g4f4 seems like the safest move that also keeps some central control.\n\n```\ng4f4\n```"
