When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and queen vs White's queen and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on e6 is attacking the g7 queen\n- White's bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White has a passed pawn on b4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's king is relatively safe on g1\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h6: Gets the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- f8f7: Blocks the queen's attack and defends g7\n- g7g6: Moves the queen away while keeping it active\n- f5f4: Pushes the pawn to gain space\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- g7h6 looks tempting but after Qxh6, Black loses material\n- f8f7 is solid but passive\n- g7g6 maintains queen activity while getting out of attack\n- f5f4 gains space but doesn't address the immediate threat\n\nThe best move appears to be g7g6, which:\n- Gets the queen out of attack\n- Maintains queen activity\n- Keeps pressure on White's position\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\n```\ng7g6\n```"
