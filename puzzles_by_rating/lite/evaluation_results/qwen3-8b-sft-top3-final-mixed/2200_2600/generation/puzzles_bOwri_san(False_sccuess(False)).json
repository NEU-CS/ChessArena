When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's pawn on b2 is one square away from promotion, but White's queen controls b1.\n2. Black's queen is very active on h1, eyeing the white king.\n3. White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger.\n4. White has a passed pawn on d4 that could be advanced.\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Queen moves that stop the pawn: d4b4 or d4b2\n2. King moves that improve safety: e5f5 or e5d5\n3. Pushing the pawn: d4d5\n\nLet's evaluate:\n- d4b4: stops the pawn but allows Qh1-h4+ skewer\n- d4b2: captures the pawn but Qh1xb2 is check and wins the queen\n- e5f5: moves king away from potential checks but doesn't address the pawn\n- d4d5: pushes the pawn but doesn't stop the b-pawn\n\nThe best move appears to be d4b4, stopping the pawn while keeping the queen active. After d4b4, if Black plays Qh1-h4+, we can respond with Ke5-f5, and the position remains balanced.\n\n```\nd4b4\n```"
