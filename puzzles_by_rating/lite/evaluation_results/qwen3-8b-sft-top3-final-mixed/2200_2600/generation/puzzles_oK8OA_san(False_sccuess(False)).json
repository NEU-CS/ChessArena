When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black has a strong centralized queen on c7 and bishop on d6\n3. White's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n4. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n5. White has potential attacking ideas against Black's king\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's king is vulnerable on the g-file\n- White has a knight on f3 that can jump to g5 with tempo (attacking the bishop on d6)\n- The bishop on c2 can potentially join the attack via h7 or g6\n- The queen on d2 is well placed to support an attack\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f3g5 - Immediate knight jump attacking the bishop\n2. c2h7 - Bishop sacrifice to open the h-file\n3. d2h6 - Queen move threatening mate on h7\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- f3g5 looks tempting but after ...Bxg5, White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- c2h7 is interesting but after ...Kxh7, White's attack may not be decisive\n- d2h6 is very strong as it threatens Qxh7# and Black has no good defense:\n  - If ...g6, then Qxh7+ Kg8 Qg7+ Kh8 Qxg6+ with a winning attack\n  - If ...Qxh6, then Bxh6 and White is up material\n  - Other moves allow Qxh7#\n\nThe most forcing and decisive move is d2h6, creating immediate threats against Black's king.\n\n```\nd2h6\n```"
