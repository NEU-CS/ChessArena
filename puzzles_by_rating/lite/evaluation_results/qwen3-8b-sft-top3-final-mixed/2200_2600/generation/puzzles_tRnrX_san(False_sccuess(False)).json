When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active, attacking f7 and g6\n- Black's queen on f5 is also active, eyeing h5 and g3\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's rook on e4 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h8: Queen sacrifice to win the rook, but after ...Rxh8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- h5f7: Forking king and rook, but after ...Kxf7 White loses the queen for rook\n- e4e6: Threatening mate on g8, but Black can defend with ...Qxe6\n- d1d5: Centralizing the rook and attacking the bishop, but not immediately threatening\n- h5g6: Forking queen and bishop, winning material\n\nAfter careful consideration, h5g6 is the strongest move:\n- It forks Black's queen and bishop\n- After ...Qxg6, White can play Rxe6 winning a pawn and maintaining pressure\n- If Black doesn't take, White wins the bishop next move\n- It maintains White's active piece play while gaining material\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to consolidate. The queen fork is the most forcing and advantageous continuation.\n\n```\nh5g6\n```"
