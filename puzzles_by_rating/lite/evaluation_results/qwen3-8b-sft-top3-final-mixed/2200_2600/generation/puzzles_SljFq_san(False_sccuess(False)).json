When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key threats:\n- White's c-pawn is one move from queening (c6-c7)\n- White's bishop controls the a8-h1 diagonal, preventing Black's king from escaping via h7\n\n3. Black's options:\n- The rook can check on h2-h1, but after Kxh1, Black loses the rook for nothing\n- The rook can attack the bishop (h2-b2), but White can just move the bishop\n- The king has some moves, but needs to prevent the c-pawn from queening\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\n- The king must stay near the c-pawn to prevent it from queening\n- g8h7 is tempting but allows c7 with mate threats\n- g8f8 is better, keeping the king near the pawn\n\nAfter considering all options, g8f8 is the most resilient move, keeping the king near the c-pawn while maintaining some rook activity. Other moves either lose immediately or allow the pawn to queen with devastating effect.\n\n```\ng8f8\n```"
