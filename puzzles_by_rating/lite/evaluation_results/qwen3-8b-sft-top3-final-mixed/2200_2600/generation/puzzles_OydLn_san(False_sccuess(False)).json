When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop vs White's queen, rook, bishop. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on f5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- Black's rook on c5 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's queen on b3 is eyeing the b7 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f7f8: King moves to corner, but doesn't improve safety\n- f7e8: King moves towards center but into potential checks\n- f7e7: King moves towards center but still exposed\n- f7f6: King moves away from center but towards edge\n- c6d5: Rook takes bishop, but after Qxd5 White's queen becomes very active\n- c5d5: Rook moves to d5, attacking the f5 pawn\n- c5c4: Rook moves to c4, attacking the b3 queen\n- d6d5: Queen moves to d5, centralizing but blocking the rook\n\n4. Best options seem to be:\n- c5c4: Immediately challenges White's queen, forcing it to move\n- c5d5: Attacks the f5 pawn while keeping rook active\n\nAfter considering:\n- c5c4 is more forcing as it immediately challenges White's queen\n- After c5c4, if Qxc4 then Rxc4 and Black's rook becomes very active\n- If White moves the queen away, Black can consider pushing the d-pawn or activating the king\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc5c4\n```"
