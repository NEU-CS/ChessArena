When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a pawn (White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight). However, Black has some compensation with the active queen and potential threats.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on a5 is very active, eyeing the b7 pawn and potentially threatening mate on g5\n- Black's queen on e1 is extremely dangerous, threatening multiple things including Qxg1#\n- Black's knight on h6 is awkwardly placed but could become active\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White has Qxb7+ winning a pawn\n- Black has Qxg1# if not prevented\n\n4. Candidate moves to prevent mate:\n- e1e2 blocks the queen's path to g1\n- e1f2 also blocks\n- h6g4 develops the knight and covers g2\n- e8e7 blocks the queen's path to g5\n\nAfter considering these, e1e2 seems most forcing as it:\n- Prevents Qxg1#\n- Maintains the queen's activity\n- Doesn't allow White to simply take on b7 with check\n\nOther moves like h6g4 allow Qxb7+ with a strong attack, while e8e7 allows Qxg1#.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne1e2\n```"
