When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and two pawns vs Black's bishop and two pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is centralized at e5\n- White's king is at d1, somewhat passive\n- Black has a passed pawn at d3 that's threatening to promote\n- White has a passed pawn at b5\n- Black's bishop controls the a8-h1 diagonal\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's d3 pawn is one move from queening\n- White must address this threat immediately\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b3c5: Attacks the d3 pawn but allows ...d2 next move\n- b3a5: Doesn't address the d3 pawn threat\n- b3d4: Blocks the d-pawn but allows ...Bxd4 winning the knight\n- d1d2: Blocks the pawn but allows ...Kxd2 winning the knight\n- g4g5: Doesn't address the main threat\n\n5. Best move seems to be b3c5:\n- It attacks the d3 pawn\n- If Black pushes ...d2, White can play Nxd2\n- If Black takes ...Bxc5, White can play Kxd3 winning the pawn\n- It maintains material balance while addressing the immediate threat\n\nOther moves either don't stop the pawn or lose material. While b3c5 doesn't completely solve the problem, it's the most resilient option.\n\n```\nb3c5\n```"
