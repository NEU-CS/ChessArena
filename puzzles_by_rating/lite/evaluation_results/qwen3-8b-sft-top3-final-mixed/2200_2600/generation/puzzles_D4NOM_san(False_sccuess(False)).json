When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's king is exposed with weak dark squares around it\n3. White has a strong bishop on f7 pinning the black knight on e6 to the king\n4. Black's queen on c5 is very active but potentially overextended\n5. White's knight on d4 is well placed but could be challenged\n\nKey observations:\n- The bishop on f7 is extremely powerful and should be preserved\n- Black's knight on e6 is pinned and cannot move without losing the queen\n- Black's queen on c5 is vulnerable to attacks from multiple directions\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f7g8 - trading the strong bishop for a rook, but this seems premature\n2. f7e8 - similar to above, but even worse\n3. d1h5 - threatening mate on h7 while attacking the queen\n4. g5h6 - threatening to win the knight on f6\n5. f1f6 - pinning the queen to the king\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d1h5 looks very strong as it threatens Qxh7# and attacks the queen simultaneously\n- Black's best response would likely be Qxd4, but then Bxd4 and White maintains a strong initiative\n- Other moves either don't capitalize on the pin or allow Black to consolidate\n\nThe most forcing and dangerous move is d1h5, creating immediate threats against both the queen and the king.\n\n```\nd1h5\n```"
