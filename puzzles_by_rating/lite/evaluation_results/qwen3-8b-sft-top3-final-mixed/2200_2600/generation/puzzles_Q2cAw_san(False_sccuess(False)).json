When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a strong passed pawn on d5\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's rook on f4 is very active\n- White's knight on f3 is under attack by Black's bishop on g7\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...Bxf3 winning the knight\n- Black could also play ...Rxf3 next move if we don't address it\n- Black's queen on b6 eyes our a2 pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g5: defends against Bxf3 but allows ...Qxa2\n- f3e5: blocks the d-pawn but leaves knight hanging to ...Rxe5\n- e2e4: blocks the d-pawn but allows ...Bxf3\n- c1c4: develops rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g1h1: moves king away from potential checks\n\nAfter considering these, the best move appears to be f3g5 because:\n- It prevents the immediate loss of the knight\n- After ...Qxa2, we can play Qxa2 and our position remains balanced\n- Other moves either lose material or allow Black to maintain strong pressure\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
