White is to move\n\nEvaluation:\n- Material is equal (2 pawns each)\n- Black's c4 pawn is passed and advanced\n- White's pawns are not yet advanced\n- Kings are active in the center\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. a4b5 - King moves toward black's pawns\n2. a4a5 - King moves forward\n3. a4b4 - King moves toward c4 pawn\n4. a4a3 - King retreats\n5. b2b3 - Advances pawn but blocks c-pawn\n6. b2b4 - Advances pawn but leaves c-pawn\n\nBest move considerations:\n- Need to stop black's c-pawn while advancing our own\n- a4b4 is strong as it directly attacks the c4 pawn\n- After a4b4, if black defends with e5d4, then b4c4 wins the pawn\n- Other king moves don't address the c4 pawn threat\n- Pawn moves either don't help or create weaknesses\n\nThe most forcing and best move is to attack the c4 pawn immediately with the king.\n\n```\na4b4\n```"

White has a king and two pawns (on b2 and c3), while Black has a king and two pawns (on c4 and f5). The key is to determine whether White can win or at least secure a draw.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move: `b4c5`\n- King moves toward the center and threatens to capture on c4.\n- After `b4c5`, Black must respond. If Black plays `Kd5`, then White can play `Kxc4`, gaining a pawn.\n- This looks promising for White.\n\nLet\u2019s explore this line:\n1. `b4c5 Kd5`\n2. `Kxc4 Ke5`\n3. `Kb3` \u2013 now White is threatening to promote the b-pawn.\n\nThis seems like a strong plan: centralize the king, capture the c4-pawn, and push the b-pawn.\n\n---\n\n### Other Moves:\n- `b4b5`: Pushes the king forward but doesn't threaten anything immediate.\n- `b4a5`: Retreats the king; not ideal.\n- `b4c4`: Captures the pawn immediately, but after `Kd5`, White loses control of the center.\n- `b4a4`, `b4a3`: Retreats again; not useful.\n- `b2b3`: A waiting move that doesn't improve White's position.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\nThe most active and strategically sound move is **`b4c5`**, which puts pressure on the c4-pawn and allows White to take control of the center.\n\nAfter `b4c5`, if Black responds with `Kd5`, then `Kxc4` follows, and White is well on the way to promoting the b-pawn.\n\n---\n\n```\nb4c5\n```"
