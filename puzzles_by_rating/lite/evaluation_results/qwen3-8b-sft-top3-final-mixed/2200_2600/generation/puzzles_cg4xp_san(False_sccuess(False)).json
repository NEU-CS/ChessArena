When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook on f4 attacking our pawn on g3, while our rook on g3 is attacking black's pawn on f4. This is a mutual attack situation.\n\n2. King safety: Our king is somewhat exposed on g1, while black's king is on g7. Black has potential threats with their rook on f4 and pawn on g5.\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - The rook on g3 is under attack from black's f4 rook\n   - Our rook on d2 is undefended\n   - Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could become dangerous\n   - Our pawn structure is slightly better with more central pawns\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - g3f3: Trading rooks would relieve pressure but leave us with doubled pawns\n   - d2d3: Blocking the d-pawn but allowing black to capture our rook\n   - d2e2: Moving the rook to safety while maintaining control\n   - g1h1: Moving the king to safety\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g3f3 seems too passive and gives up our rook for no compensation\n- d2d3 loses material immediately\n- d2e2 is solid but doesn't address the immediate rook threat\n- g1h1 is safe but doesn't improve our position\n\nThe best move appears to be d2d3, forcing black to either:\n1) Take our rook with f4xd3, after which we can recapture with g3xd3, eliminating black's dangerous passed pawn\n2) Move their rook away, allowing us to maintain control of the position\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous continuation.\n\n```\nd2d3\n```"
