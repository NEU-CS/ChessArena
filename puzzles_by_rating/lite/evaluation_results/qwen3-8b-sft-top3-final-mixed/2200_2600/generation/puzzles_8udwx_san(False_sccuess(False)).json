When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qxf2+`\n    - Then `Ke2` or `Kh1` (king moves)\n    - Black gains a full rook for free \u2014 this looks like a **very strong move**.\n\nLet\u2019s test this line further:\n- `... Qxf2+ Ke2 Qxg2` \u2013 Black wins a rook and keeps attacking.\n- Alternatively, after `... Qxf2+ Kh1`, Black still wins a rook and continues pressing.\n\nThis seems like a **clear tactical win**.\n\n#### 2. Other queen moves (`d4d8`, `d4g7`, etc.)\n- These don\u2019t offer immediate material gain or threats.\n- They may be useful in some lines, but not as strong as `d4f2`.\n\n#### 3. Rook moves (`f8f7`, `f8f6`, etc.)\n- Moving the rook without capturing something valuable doesn\u2019t seem justified here.\n\n#### 4. Bishop moves (`c4g8`, `c4f7`, etc.)\n- Some of these might set up discovered attacks, but none seem to beat `d4f2`.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe move **`d4f2`** (Queen takes rook with check) is a **clear tactical winner**. It wins material immediately and gives Black a decisive advantage.\n\n```\nd4f2\n```"
