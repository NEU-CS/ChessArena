When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has king + 3 pawns vs White's king + 3 pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on b5 that's very dangerous\n- Black's pawns on f6 and h5 are potential weaknesses\n- White's king is more active (b5 vs c7)\n- Black's king is somewhat restricted by White's pawn on b5\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- King moves: c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7d7, c7b7\n- Pawn moves: f6f5, e6e5\n\n4. Evaluating king moves:\n- c7d8: moves away from the b-pawn but allows White to push b6\n- c7c8: same issue as d8\n- c7b8: blocks the b-pawn but is very passive\n- c7d7: keeps options open but still allows b6\n- c7b7: best as it directly blocks the b-pawn's advance\n\n5. Evaluating pawn moves:\n- f6f5: creates a passed pawn but weakens e5\n- e6e5: blocks the b-pawn but creates a backward d-pawn\n\nThe most critical factor is stopping White's b-pawn. c7b7 is the only move that directly blocks it while keeping the king active. Other moves either allow b6 or are too passive.\n\n```\nc7b7\n```"
