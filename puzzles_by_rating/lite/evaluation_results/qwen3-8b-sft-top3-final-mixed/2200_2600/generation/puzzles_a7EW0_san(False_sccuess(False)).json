When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully as Black.\n\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a strong centralized queen on f3 and bishop on c4, putting pressure on Black's position.\n2. Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited pawn cover.\n3. Black's rook on h8 is passive and needs activation.\n4. White has a passed pawn on g4 that could become dangerous.\n5. Black's queen on b4 is active but potentially vulnerable.\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h8g8 - Activates the rook and connects rooks\n2. e8e7 - Gets the king to slightly safer square\n3. b4e7 - Queen moves to defend and potentially attack\n4. b4d6 - Queen moves to attack the bishop\n\nAfter considering:\n- h8g8 looks most logical as it activates the rook and prepares to double rooks on the g-file. The rook will be more active than on h8 where it's blocked by the pawn on h7.\n- e8e7 is too passive and doesn't improve Black's position.\n- b4e7 is interesting but allows White to play Qxe7 winning the queen.\n- b4d6 is tempting but after Bxd6 exd6, White's bishop pair becomes very strong.\n\nThe best move is to activate the rook first before considering queen moves. The king is relatively safe on e8 for now as White doesn't have immediate threats.\n\n```\nh8g8\n```"
