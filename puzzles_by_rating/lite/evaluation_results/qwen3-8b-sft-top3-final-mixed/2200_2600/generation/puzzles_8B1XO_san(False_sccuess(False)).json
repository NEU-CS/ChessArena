When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on f4 is eyeing the g6 pawn and could potentially create mating threats\n- White's rook on d1 is controlling the d-file\n- White's bishop on g2 is pinning the f8 rook to the king\n\n3. Black's defensive needs:\n- Need to protect the g6 pawn\n- Need to deal with the pin on the f8 rook\n- Need to activate the rook on c2\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8f7: Unpins the rook but allows Qxg6\n- e6f7: Blocks the pin but leaves g6 hanging\n- c2g2: Capturing the bishop but allowing Qxg6\n- b4d6: Developing the knight but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c2c1: Moving the rook to safety\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be c2g2, sacrificing the bishop to eliminate the pin and maintain material equality. While it allows Qxg6, Black can then play Rxf4, and after exf4, Black has compensation with the active rook and knight.\n\n```\nc2g2\n```"
