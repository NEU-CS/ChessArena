When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's rooks are very active and controlling important files/ranks\n- Black's king is exposed on f4\n- White has a passed pawn on f3 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rooks are somewhat passive but can become active\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rf4+ winning the king\n- White could push f4, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- White could double rooks on the e-file\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: f4g5 looks interesting to get away from checks\n- Rook moves: e2e1 to defend the king, or g2g1 to connect rooks\n- Pawn moves: h7h5 to create counterplay\n\n5. Best move seems to be f4g5:\n- Gets the king to safety away from checks\n- Prepares to bring the king towards the center\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics from White\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nOther options like e2e1 are too passive, and pawn moves don't address the king safety issue.\n\n```\nf4g5\n```"
