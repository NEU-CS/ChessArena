When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawn.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on e6 is very powerful, eyeing the g8 rook and controlling key squares\n- White's rook on g7 is attacking the g8 rook\n- White's bishop on d3 is controlling important diagonals\n\n3. Black's options:\n- The rook on g8 is under attack and needs to be saved\n- The queen has many possible moves but needs to be careful about getting trapped\n- The h4 pawn is passed but not immediately threatening\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8g7: Trading rooks but leaving the queen trapped after Qxg7\n- g2g7: Blocking with the queen, but after Qxg7 Rg7, White has Qxg7+\n- g2g6: Moving the queen to safety while attacking the bishop\n- h4h3: Pushing the passed pawn, but this seems too slow\n\nAfter considering these options, g2g6 seems best because:\n- It saves the rook by attacking the bishop\n- The queen is now active and safe\n- It maintains material equality (after Bxg6, Rxg6)\n- It prevents immediate threats from White's pieces\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the queen in a vulnerable position.\n\n```\ng2g6\n```"
