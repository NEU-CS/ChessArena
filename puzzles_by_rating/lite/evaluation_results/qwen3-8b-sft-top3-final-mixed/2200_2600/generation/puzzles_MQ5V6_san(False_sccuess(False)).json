When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's rook on b7 is very active, pinning the a6 bishop to the king\n- Black's rook on d7 is tied to defending the d6 pawn\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rb7-b6, attacking the a6 bishop and threatening to win material\n- White might try to push the e-pawn or activate their king\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7h8: Gets the king to safety but leaves the rook on d7 hanging\n- d7d8: Rook moves to safety but blocks the bishop\n- a6b7: Bishop takes the rook, but after Kxb7 Black loses material\n- c8e7: Bishop moves to defend the rook while keeping options open\n\nAfter considering these, c8e7 seems best because:\n- It defends the rook on d7\n- It keeps the bishop active\n- It maintains flexibility for the king\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the king too exposed.\n\n```\nc8e7\n```"
