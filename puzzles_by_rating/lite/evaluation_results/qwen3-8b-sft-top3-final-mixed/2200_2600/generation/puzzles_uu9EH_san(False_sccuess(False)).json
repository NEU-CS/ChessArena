When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook (c5), pawns (a2, b2, c4, g4, h4)\n   - Black has: Rook (e2), pawns (a7, c6, d4, g7, h7)\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's rook is attacking White's pawn on e2 (but it's actually White's king that's in check from the rook on e2)\n   - White's king is in check from the black rook on e2\n   - White must get out of check on the next move\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves to escape check:\n   - g2h3: King moves to h3 (safe)\n   - g2g3: King moves to g3 (safe)\n   - g2f3: King moves to f3 (safe)\n   - g2h1: King moves to h1 (safe)\n   - g2g1: King moves to g1 (safe)\n   - g2f1: King moves to f1 (safe)\n\n4. Evaluating the best escape square:\n   - g2h3: Puts king near the edge, but doesn't block any threats\n   - g2g3: Keeps king more centralized\n   - g2f3: Gets closer to the action but might be exposed\n   - g2h1: Too passive\n   - g2g1: Too passive\n   - g2f1: Too passive\n\n5. Best choice is g2g3 because:\n   - It keeps the king active and centralized\n   - It doesn't expose the king to any new threats\n   - It maintains flexibility for future moves\n   - It's the most natural escape square\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ng2g3\n```"
