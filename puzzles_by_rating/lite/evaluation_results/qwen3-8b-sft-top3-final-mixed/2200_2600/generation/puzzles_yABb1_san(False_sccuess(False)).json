When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n3. White has a strong knight on e5 that's very active\n4. Black's queen on c7 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n5. White's rook on c1 is pinning the pawn on b6 to the queen\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on e5 has several tempting moves, but we need to find the most forcing one\n- e5f7 looks very strong as it forks the king and rook\n- After e5f7, if Kxf7 then Qxc7 wins the queen\n- Black might try Qxe5 instead, but then Nxe5 and White is up material\n- Other knight moves don't create immediate threats\n- The queen moves don't seem as forcing as the knight fork\n\nLet me verify e5f7:\n1. e5f7 Qxe5 (only reasonable move)\n2. Nxe5 and White is up a queen for rook and knight - a decisive material advantage\n\nOther candidate moves like e3h6 or e3g5 don't create immediate threats. The knight fork is the most forcing and decisive move.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
