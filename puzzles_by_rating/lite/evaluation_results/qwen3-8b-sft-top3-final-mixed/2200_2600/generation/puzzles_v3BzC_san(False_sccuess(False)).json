When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If White doesn't defend properly, this could lead to mate.\n- However, White can respond with `Qxe1`, so it's not immediately decisive.\n\n#### 4. `d8d7` \u2013 Rook to d7, supporting the queen and preparing to double rooks.\n- Solid development, but passive compared to other options.\n\n#### 5. `d4d5` \u2013 Queen to d5, centralizing and pressuring e4 and f3.\n- Strong central control, supports possible ...f5 or ...g5 breaks.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Evaluation:\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be:\n\n### `d4e3`\n\nWhy?\n- It attacks the rook on f3.\n- Threatens Qxg1 if White isn't careful.\n- Forces White to make a defensive move.\n- Keeps the queen active and dangerous.\n\n---\n\n```\nd4e3\n```"
