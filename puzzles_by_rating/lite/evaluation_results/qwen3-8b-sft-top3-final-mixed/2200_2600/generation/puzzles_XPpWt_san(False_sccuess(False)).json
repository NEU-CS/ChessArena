When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has bishop vs White's bishop and pawn. White has a passed d-pawn that's quite advanced.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on f7, while White's king is relatively safe on h5.\n\n3. Key threats: White's d5 pawn is threatening to promote soon. Black needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Bishop moves: The bishop is currently blocking the d-pawn's promotion. Moving it allows d6.\n- King moves: f7g8 or f7e8 would be safer, but don't address the pawn threat.\n- c6c5: This would block the pawn, but after dxc5, White gets connected passed pawns.\n- g5g4: This seems pointless and weakens Black's position.\n\n5. Best option: The bishop must stay to prevent promotion. The most active square is f8b4, attacking the d5 pawn while also eyeing the h2 pawn. This maintains maximum activity for the bishop while keeping the pawn under control.\n\nAfter f8b4, if White plays d6, Black can take with exd6, and the position remains balanced. Other bishop moves either allow promotion or are less active.\n\n```\nf8b4\n```"
