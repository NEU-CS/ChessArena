When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's bishop on e3 is pinning White's pawn on f2 to the king\n- White's rook on c7 is very active and can potentially deliver checks\n- Black's rook on a2 is threatening to capture the h2 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7c8: Rook lift to threaten the rook on a8\n- b5d6: Knight fork attacking queen and bishop\n- e1e3: Capturing the bishop but allowing Qxg3\n- f1f2: Blocking the pin but allowing Qxf2+\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5d6:\n- It's a knight fork attacking both the queen and bishop\n- After Qxd6, White can play Nxe3, winning the bishop\n- Even if Black moves the queen, White wins the bishop\n- It maintains the initiative and removes Black's most active piece\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or allow Black to maintain pressure. The knight fork is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nb5d6\n```"
