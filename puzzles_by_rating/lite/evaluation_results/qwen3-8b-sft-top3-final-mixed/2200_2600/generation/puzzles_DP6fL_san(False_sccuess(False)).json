When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze this endgame position carefully.\n\nKey features of the position:\n1. Material is equal (both sides have 3 pawns)\n2. White's king is more active (d5 vs black's f5)\n3. Black has connected passed pawns on the g and h files\n4. White has a passed pawn on b4\n5. Black's a-pawn is blocked by White's a2 pawn\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d5d6 - King advances, but allows black to push g5-g4\n2. d5c6 - King moves toward queenside, but abandons center\n3. d5c5 - King stays central but doesn't make progress\n4. d5d4 - King steps back, but seems passive\n5. h3h4 - Stops black's g5-g4 push, but weakens kingside\n6. g3g4 - Directly blocks black's pawn advance\n7. a2a3 - Prepares to push b-pawn, but slow\n8. a2a4 - Immediately pushes passed pawn\n\nThe most critical factor is black's connected passed pawns. If we don't stop them, they will become dangerous. g3g4 is the most direct way to block their advance while maintaining our pawn structure.\n\nAfter g3g4, if black plays g5-g4, we can take with hxg4 and our king can help stop the pawns. Other moves either allow black's pawns to advance or don't address this immediate threat.\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
