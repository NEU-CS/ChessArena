When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material and pawn structure:\n- Black has a king on h6 and pawns on f5, h4, g6\n- White has a king on f4 and pawns on g3, h3, f3, g2\n- Black is to move\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's king is very active and close to Black's pawns\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h6\n- Both sides have passed pawns, but White's are more advanced\n- The h-pawn is a potential target for both sides\n\n3. Evaluating candidate moves:\n- h6h7: Moves king away from center, doesn't accomplish much\n- h6g7: Moves king towards center but still passive\n- h6h5: Moves king forward but exposes it to checks\n- h4g3: Captures a pawn but opens up the position\n- g6g5: Advances the pawn, creating a passed pawn\n\n4. Best move considerations:\n- g6g5 seems most promising as it:\n  - Creates a passed pawn on g5\n  - Restricts White's king movement\n  - Prepares to advance the pawn further\n  - If White takes (fxg5), Black can recapture with h4xg3, creating connected passed pawns\n  - If White doesn't take, Black can push g5-g4 creating a dangerous passed pawn\n\n5. Other moves:\n- h4g3 leads to complications but gives White's king more activity\n- King moves don't improve Black's position\n\nAfter careful consideration, advancing the g-pawn is the most principled move, creating counterplay and forcing White to react.\n\n```\ng6g5\n```"
