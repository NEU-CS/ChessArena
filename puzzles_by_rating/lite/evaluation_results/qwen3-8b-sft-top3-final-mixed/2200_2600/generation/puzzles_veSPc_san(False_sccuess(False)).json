When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on c4 and queen on d3 eyeing the b5 square\n- Black's queen on b4 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's rooks are doubled on the e-file\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Critical threats:\n- White could play Qxb5 winning the bishop\n- White could also play Nxb5 winning the queen\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b4b5: Defends the bishop but allows Qxb5\n- b4c4: Trades queens but gives up the bishop\n- b4e1: Interesting sacrifice to expose White's king\n- d7g4: Develops the bishop with tempo against the queen\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- b4e1 looks tempting as it sacrifices the queen for two pawns and exposes White's king\n- After 1...Qe1 2.Kf2 Qxh1 3.Qxh1, Black is up a rook for a bishop\n- White's king remains exposed and Black has active pieces\n\nThis seems like the most promising continuation to turn the game around.\n\n```\nb4e1\n```"
