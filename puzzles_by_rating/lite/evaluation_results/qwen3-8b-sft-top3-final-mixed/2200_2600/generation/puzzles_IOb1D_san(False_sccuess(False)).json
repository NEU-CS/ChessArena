When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong bishop on f6 that's very active and pinning the e7 knight to the king\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White's queen on d2 is eyeing the d8 queen\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is that White could play Qxd8 winning the queen\n- We need to protect our queen while improving our position\n- The knight on e7 is pinned and needs to be moved or protected\n- The bishop on c8 is blocked by the knight on b6\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d8d7 - moves queen to safety but blocks the d-file\n2. c8d7 - develops bishop and protects queen\n3. e7g6 - moves knight away from pin but leaves queen hanging\n4. b6d5 - moves knight to active square and protects queen\n\nAfter considering these:\n- c8d7 seems most solid, developing a piece while protecting the queen\n- It also prepares to possibly castle queenside if needed\n- Other moves either leave the queen unprotected or don't improve our position\n\nThe best move appears to be:\n\n```\nc8d7\n```"
