When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, queen, bishop, knight vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight). \n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong rook on f5 attacking Black's pawn on e4\n- Black's king is exposed on h7 with White's rook eyeing the h-file\n- Black's knight on d3 is very active but potentially trapped\n- White's queen on b3 is eyeing the b7 pawn\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxb7 winning a pawn\n- White could play Rxe4 winning a pawn\n- White could play Qb7+ forcing Kh8 and then Rxe4\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d3e5: Blocking the rook's attack on e4 while developing the knight\n- d8e7: Protecting the e4 pawn and connecting rooks\n- d6e5: Blocking with the bishop\n- h7h8: Getting the king to safety\n\nAfter considering these options, d3e5 seems most promising because:\n- It blocks the rook's attack on e4\n- The knight becomes more active on e5\n- It maintains control over f4 and g6 squares\n- It doesn't allow White to win material immediately\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- d8e7 allows Qxb7\n- h7h8 allows Rxe4\n- d6e5 blocks our own bishop's activity\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd3e5\n```"
