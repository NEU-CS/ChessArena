When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

However, White's king is exposed and Black has some active pieces.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on g7 is attacking the rook on f8\n- White's rook on f6 is very active and threatening\n- White has potential mating threats with the rook on f6 and queen coordination\n\n3. Immediate concerns:\n- The rook on f8 is under attack and needs to be saved\n- The king is exposed and needs to find safety\n- Need to deal with the threat of Rf6-f7+ winning the queen\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8h8 - moving the rook away from attack\n- e7e8 - blocking with the king\n- e5g6 - counterattacking the queen\n- e5c6 - developing the knight\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f8h8 seems passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n- e7e8 blocks but leaves the king very exposed\n- e5g6 is tempting but after Qxg6, Black's position collapses\n- e5c6 is interesting but doesn't address immediate threats\n\nThe best move appears to be e7e8, blocking the rook's attack while getting the king to relative safety. Although the king is exposed, it's the most resilient option that maintains some coordination between pieces.\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
