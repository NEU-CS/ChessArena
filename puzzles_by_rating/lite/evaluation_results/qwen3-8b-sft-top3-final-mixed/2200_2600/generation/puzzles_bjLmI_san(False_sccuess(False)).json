When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b6 is very active, eyeing the b7 pawn and controlling important squares.\n- Black's queen on c3 is threatening White's rook on f6.\n- Black's king is exposed on b8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a passed pawn on d5 that could become dangerous.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6f7: Rook lift to 7th rank, but allows Black's queen to take it (Qxf7)\n- b6b7: Queen takes pawn, but after Kxb7 White loses the queen for rook+bishop\n- c7e8: Knight fork attacking rook and king, but Black can play Qxf6 first\n- f6h6: Rook moves to h6, but doesn't accomplish much\n- b6e6: Queen moves to e6, maintaining pressure while protecting f6\n\n4. Best move seems to be b6e6:\n- Protects the rook on f6 from the queen\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps pressure on Black's position\n- Prepares potential discovered attacks with the knight\n- If Black takes the rook (Qxf6), White can play Nxe8 winning the rook back\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve White's position as much. The queen move to e6 is the most flexible and maintains White's initiative.\n\n```\nb6e6\n```"
