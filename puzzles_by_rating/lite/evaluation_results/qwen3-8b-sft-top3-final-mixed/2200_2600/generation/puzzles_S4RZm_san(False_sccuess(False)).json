When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, rook and pawns vs Black's knight, bishop, rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on c7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on b7\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous\n- Black has a rook on c3 that's pinning White's pawn on d4 to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Knight moves: c7e8+ looks tempting as it forks king and rook\n- Bishop moves: f6h8 threatens mate on h7\n- Rook moves: d2d3 breaks the pin but allows ...Rxd3\n- Pawn moves: e5e6 advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Calculating c7e8+:\n- After 1...Kc8, White can play 2.Bh8 threatening mate\n- Black would have to play 2...Kd7 to prevent mate, but then 3.Bg7 is strong\n\n5. Calculating f6h8:\n- Threatens mate on h7, but Black can defend with ...Rg3\n- Then White would need to find another plan\n\n6. Calculating e5e6:\n- Advances the passed pawn but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Black can respond with ...dxe6 or ...fxe6\n\nThe most forcing and dangerous move appears to be c7e8+, creating immediate threats against Black's king. This maintains the initiative and forces Black to react defensively.\n\n```\nc7e8\n```"
