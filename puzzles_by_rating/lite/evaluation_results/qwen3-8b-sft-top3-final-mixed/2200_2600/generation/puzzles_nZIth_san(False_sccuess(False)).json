When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's pawn on a6 is passed and dangerous\n- Black's knight is well placed on b5, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n- White's king is active on c4\n\n3. Threats:\n- White wants to push the a-pawn (a6-a7) to promote\n- Black needs to stop this while maintaining material advantage\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Knight moves: b5d6 looks strong, blocking the pawn's path\n- King moves: e7d6 brings king closer to help stop the pawn\n- Pawn moves: h7h5/g7g5 don't address the main threat\n\n5. Best move analysis:\n- b5d6 blocks the pawn immediately and maintains knight's activity\n- After a6-a7, Black can play Nc4+ winning the pawn\n- Other knight moves either don't stop the pawn or lose control\n- King moves are too slow to stop the pawn in time\n\nThe most precise move is to block the pawn with the knight:\n\n```\nb5d6\n```"
