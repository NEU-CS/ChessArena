When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed a-pawn that's advanced to a5.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook is on a2, attacking White's b4 pawn\n- White's rook is on f4, bishop on d4\n- Black's king is on e6, White's king on f1\n- Black has a passed f-pawn on f3\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is ...Rxb4, winning a pawn\n- White needs to either defend b4 or create counterplay\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f4f5: Pushes pawn but doesn't address the threat\n- d4b6: Blocks the rook's attack on b4 while developing the bishop\n- d4a7: Also defends b4 but leaves bishop less active\n- f4h4: Moves rook away from defense of b4\n- a5a6: Advances passed pawn but doesn't address immediate threat\n\n5. Best move seems to be d4b6:\n- Defends the b4 pawn by blocking the rook's path\n- The bishop becomes more active on b6\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- After ...Rxb4, Bxb4 Kxb4, White can push a6 with good chances\n\nOther moves either don't defend b4 or leave White in a worse position. For example, moving the rook away would lose material, and pawn pushes don't address the immediate threat.\n\n```\nd4b6\n```"
