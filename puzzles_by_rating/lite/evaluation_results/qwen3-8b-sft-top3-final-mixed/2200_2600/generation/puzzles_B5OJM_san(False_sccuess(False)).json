When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, queen, rook, and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen, and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on e8 with no pawn cover\n- White has a strong knight on e4 attacking f6 and d6\n- Black's bishop on h3 is very active, pinning White's f2 pawn to the king\n- Black's queen on g2 is threatening mate on g1\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's Qg2 is threatening Qxg1#\n- White must address this threat immediately\n\n4. Candidate moves to stop mate:\n- e2h5 blocks the queen's path to g1\n- e2g4 also blocks the queen's path\n- e1d1 moves the king away from danger\n- e2f1 blocks with the pawn\n\n5. Evaluating options:\n- e2h5 looks tempting but after ...Bxh5, White loses material\n- e2g4 is better as it maintains the pawn structure\n- e1d1 is safe but passive\n- e2f1 is solid but blocks the rook\n\n6. After e2g4:\n- If ...Qxg4, then Nxg4 and White is fine\n- If ...Qh2, then Qxh2 and White is better\n- The pawn remains defended by the bishop\n\n7. Other moves like e4f6 or e4d6 don't address the immediate mate threat.\n\nThe best move is to block the mate threat while maintaining material balance. e2g4 accomplishes this.\n\n```\ne2g4\n```"
