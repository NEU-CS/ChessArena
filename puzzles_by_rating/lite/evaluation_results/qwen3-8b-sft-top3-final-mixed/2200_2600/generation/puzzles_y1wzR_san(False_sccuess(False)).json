When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: Queen (c8), Rook (e6), King (f4), Pawn (h4)\n- **Black**: Queen (a1), Rook (a4), King (e2), Pawns (b5, e4, g6)\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Black\u2019s king is quite exposed but not in immediate danger.\n- White has a strong queen and rook coordination, especially with the rook on e6 and queen on c8.\n- Black\u2019s queen is on a1, which is a passive square \u2014 it needs to become more active.\n- The black rook on a4 is semi-active; it can be improved.\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4, which could be a long-term asset if advanced.\n- Black must avoid getting into a zugzwang or allowing White to coordinate a mating net.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### Rook moves:\n- `a4a8`: Brings rook to the back rank, possibly to support a future ...b4 or to pressure the white queen.\n- `a4a7`: Similar idea, but less aggressive.\n- `a4a6`: Could support a push of the b-pawn.\n- `a4a5`: Prepares to double rooks or support a pawn break.\n- `a4d4`: Centralizes the rook, pressures d-file, and supports e4 pawn.\n- `a4c4`: Also centralizes, but less effective than Rd4.\n- `a4b4`: Supports b5 pawn, prepares ...b4.\n- `a4a3`, `a4a2`: Pushing the rook forward, but not very useful unless there's a tactical idea.\n\n#### King moves:\n- `e2d3`, `e2f2`, `e2d2`, `e2f1`, `e2e1`, `e2d1`: These are mostly defensive king moves. Not ideal unless necessary.\n\n#### Queen moves:\n- `a1h8`, `a1g7`, `a1f6`, `a1e5`, `a1d4`, `a1c3`, `a1a3`, `a1b2`, `a1a2`, `a1h1`, `a1g1`, `a1f1`, `a1e1`, `a1d1`, `a1c1`, `a1b1`: Many options, but most are either passive or risky. `a1d4` stands out as a good active move, eyeing the center and potentially threatening White\u2019s rook on e6.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- `g6g5`: Advances the pawn, creates space, and may help activate the king.\n- `b5b4`: Advances the queenside pawn, opens lines for the rook.\n- `e4e3`: Pushes the central pawn, creates a passed pawn, and forces White to respond.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Evaluation:\n\nLet\u2019s focus on **...e4-e3** (`e4e3`):\n\n- This move creates a **passed pawn** on e3.\n- It forces White to deal with the threat of promoting.\n- It opens up the e-file for the black rook.\n- It activates the black queen via ...Qd4 or ...Qe5.\n- It gives Black a clear plan: push the e-pawn, support it with rook and queen, and try to promote.\n\nThis is a strong, dynamic move that improves Black\u2019s chances significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```\ne4e3\n```"
