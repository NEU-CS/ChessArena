When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on h5 is very dangerous, eyeing the h-file and potentially threatening Rh8#\n- Black's king is exposed on d8\n- Black's bishop on d6 is blocked by its own pawn on c6\n- White's king is centralized on e4\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Rh8# if given the chance\n- White might try to push pawns or activate the king further\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: d8e8 looks safest, getting away from potential checks\n- Bishop moves: d6e5 blocks the rook's path to h8 and develops the bishop\n- Pawn moves: c6c5 could be considered to free the bishop\n\n5. Best options:\n- d8e8 gets the king to safety but doesn't address the rook threat\n- d6e5 is very strong as it blocks the rook's path to h8 while developing the bishop\n- Other bishop moves either don't help or make the position worse\n\nAfter considering all options, d6e5 is the most principled move as it:\n- Blocks the rook's path to h8\n- Develops the bishop to a more active square\n- Maintains material equality\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nThe other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems.\n\n```\nd6e5\n```"
