When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is equal, but White has a passed pawn on d5.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on d5\n- Black has a strong bishop on g5 pinning White's pawn on d4\n- Black's queen on c3 is very active\n- White's rook on f1 is under attack by Black's bishop\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- d5e6: King moves forward, but into potential discovered checks\n- d5c6: King moves away from center, but still exposed\n- d5e5: King stays central but might be safer\n- d5e4: King moves toward pawn, but into potential attack\n- c5d6: Pawn takes bishop, but loses queen to rook\n- b5d7: Pawn takes rook, but loses queen to bishop\n\n4. Best option seems to be b5d7:\n- Wins the rook immediately\n- After Qxd7, White can play Qxd7+ Kxd7\n- Then Kxd7 and White has queen vs rook and bishop\n- This is better than losing the queen for a pawn\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the king too exposed. Taking the rook is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nb5d7\n```"
