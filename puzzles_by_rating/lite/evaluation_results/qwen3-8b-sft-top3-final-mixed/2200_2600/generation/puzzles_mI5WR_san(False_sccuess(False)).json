When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e4\n- Black has a passed pawn on f4 that could become dangerous\n- White's g4 pawn is under attack by Black's f4 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: h5h8 looks tempting to check the king, but after ...Ke5 the rook has no good follow-up\n- h5h7 threatens the a7 pawn but doesn't create immediate threats\n- h5g5 pins the f4 pawn to the king - this looks very strong\n- King moves: g1h2 gets the king to safety but is passive\n- Pawn moves: g2g3 defends the pawn but gives up the advanced position\n\n4. The most forcing and promising move appears to be h5g5, pinning the f4 pawn to the king. After this:\n- If Black moves the king, we can capture the f4 pawn\n- If Black pushes f4f3, we can take with g4xf3\n- The pin prevents Black from defending the f4 pawn normally\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. The pin is the most disruptive idea.\n\n```\nh5g5\n```"
