When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal, but White has a passed a-pawn that could become dangerous.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8 with White's queen and bishop eyeing it. White's king is relatively safe on g2.\n\n3. Immediate threats: Black's queen on b2 is attacking White's bishop on h3. The bishop must move or be defended.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: h3c8 looks tempting as it forks king and queen, but after ...Kf7 the bishop is trapped.\n- h3d7 seems safer, keeping pressure on f7.\n- Queen moves: f1f7 is very strong, threatening mate on f8 while attacking the bishop on c6.\n- Pawn moves: a4a5 advances the passed pawn but doesn't address the immediate threat to the bishop.\n\n5. Best move appears to be f1f7:\n- Threatens Qxf8# if Black doesn't respond\n- Attacks the bishop on c6\n- If Black takes with ...Bxf7, then Bxf7+ wins the queen\n- If Black moves the king, White can play Qxf8#\n\nOther moves either don't address the threat to the bishop or miss this strong tactical opportunity.\n\n```\nf1f7\n```"
