When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: King on c5, Rook on f5, Pawn on d4, Pawn on h5\n- **Black**: King on f7, Rook on g4, Pawn on g7, Pawn on f6\n\n### Goals for Black:\n- Avoid losing\n- Try to win if possible\n- If not, secure a draw\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The Black king is relatively safe, but White has a rook and two pawns.\n- The White king is active and close to the center.\n- The Black rook is on g4, attacking the h4 square and potentially threatening to infiltrate.\n- The White rook is on f5, eyeing the 5th rank and possibly supporting a pawn advance.\n- Black has two pawns (g7 and f6), which could be used to create a passed pawn or blockades.\n- Black must avoid being pushed into a corner or losing the rook.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `f7g8`: King to g8 \u2013 centralizes slightly, keeps king away from danger.\n- `f7f8`: King to f8 \u2013 passive, but safe.\n- `f7e8`: King to e8 \u2013 moves toward the center, possibly useful.\n- `f7e7`: King to e7 \u2013 active, supports potential counterplay.\n- `f7e6`: King to e6 \u2013 very active, could help support a pawn break or blockade.\n\n#### Rook moves:\n- `g4g6`: Rook to g6 \u2013 attacks the g7 pawn, but may allow White to capture with Rxg6.\n- `g4g5`: Rook to g5 \u2013 pins the h5 pawn, restricts White\u2019s king.\n- `g4h4`: Rook to h4 \u2013 threatens the h5 pawn directly.\n- `g4f4`: Rook to f4 \u2013 challenges the White rook on f5.\n- `g4e4`: Rook to e4 \u2013 centralizes the rook, pressures the 4th rank.\n- `g4d4`: Rook to d4 \u2013 captures the d4 pawn! This is a tactical option.\n- `g4g3`: Rook to g3 \u2013 threatens the h3 square, but not much there.\n- `g4g2`: Rook to g2 \u2013 too far from action.\n- `g4g1`: Rook to g1 \u2013 also too far.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- `g7g6`: Advances the pawn, creates space, but weakens the king.\n- `g7g5`: Creates a passed pawn, but may be premature.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most promising options:\n\n#### `g4d4` \u2013 Rook takes d4 pawn\n- This is a **tactical move**.\n- It removes a key White pawn and opens up the d-file.\n- After `g4d4`, White must respond. Let's see what happens:\n  - `Kxd4` \u2013 White king captures the rook? No, because the rook is on g4, not d4.\n  - Actually, after `g4d4`, the rook is now on d4, and White can play `Kxd4`.\n  - Then Black can play `Ke6`, centralizing the king and threatening to push pawns.\n  - This seems like a good trade: Black gains a pawn and removes a dangerous passer.\n\nSo `g4d4` is a **strong candidate**.\n\n#### `g4g5` \u2013 Rook to g5\n- Pins the h5 pawn.\n- Restricts the White king.\n- Keeps the rook active.\n- Also good.\n\n#### `f7e6` \u2013 King to e6\n- Very active.\n- Supports a possible pawn break or blockade.\n- Good long-term plan.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\nBetween `g4d4`, `g4g5`, and `f7e6`.\n\n- `g4d4` is the **most concrete and immediate gain**: you remove a dangerous pawn and open lines.\n- It also forces White to react, giving you initiative.\n\nThus, the best move is:\n\n```\ng4d4\n```"
