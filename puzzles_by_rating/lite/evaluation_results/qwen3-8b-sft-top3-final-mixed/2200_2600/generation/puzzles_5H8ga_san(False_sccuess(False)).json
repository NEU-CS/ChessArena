When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's bishop, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on d5 controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active, pinning White's pawn on g3\n- White's queen on d2 is defending the d5 bishop\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: King moves to corner, but doesn't accomplish much\n- g8f8: King moves away from potential checks, but still passive\n- g8g7: King moves towards center but exposes to potential checks\n- d7f7: Queen moves to attack the pinned pawn on g3\n- d7e6: Queen moves to centralize and attack d5 bishop\n- g4e6: Bishop takes the strong d5 bishop\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- g4e6 seems most promising as it:\n  - Removes White's strong bishop\n  - Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n  - After Bxe6, Black can play Qxe6 with active queen\n  - White's queen would have to recapture, allowing Black to develop initiative\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to maintain pressure. The bishop capture is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\ng4e6\n```"
