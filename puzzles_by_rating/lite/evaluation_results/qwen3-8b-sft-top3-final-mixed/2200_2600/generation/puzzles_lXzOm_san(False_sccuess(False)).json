When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong queen on c5 attacking f8 and b7\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- Black's rook on a8 is inactive\n- White has pressure on the e-file with rook on f2 and pawn on e3\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxf8+ winning the rook\n- White could play Rf7+ winning the king\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8 - moves king to safety but blocks rook\n- f5c8 - bishop blocks queen's attack on f8\n- e5e8 - queen blocks queen's attack on f8\n- a8h8 - activates rook\n\nAfter considering these:\n- f5c8 seems best as it blocks the queen's attack on f8 while developing the bishop to a good diagonal\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses\n\nThe move f5c8:\n- Blocks Qxf8+ threat\n- Develops bishop to a good diagonal\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf5c8\n```"
