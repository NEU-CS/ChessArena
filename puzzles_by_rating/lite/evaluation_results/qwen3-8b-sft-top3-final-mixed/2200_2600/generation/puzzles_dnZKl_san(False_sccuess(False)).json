When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have 4 pawns and a king)\n2. White's king is more active (e4 vs b6)\n3. Black's pawns are more advanced but potentially vulnerable\n4. White has a passed pawn on f5 that could become dangerous\n5. Black's king is currently blocking the b-pawn's advance\n\nKey considerations:\n- White's threat is to push the f-pawn (f5-f6) which would be very dangerous\n- Black needs to either stop this or create counterplay\n- The b5 pawn is under attack by White's king and needs protection\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. b6c7 - moves king towards center but away from pawns\n2. b6b7 - similar to c7, not ideal\n3. b6a7 - moves king away from action\n4. b6c6 - blocks f-pawn but leaves b-pawn hanging\n5. b6a6 - protects b5 pawn but doesn't address f-pawn\n6. b6a5 - same as a6 but more passive\n7. b5a4 - pushes pawn but leaves it weak\n8. h6h5 - creates counterplay on kingside\n9. c5c4 - creates passed pawn but may be premature\n10. b5b4 - pushes pawn but leaves it weak\n\nBest options seem to be:\n- h6h5 to create counterplay on kingside\n- b6a6 to protect the b5 pawn while keeping options open\n\nAfter considering, h6h5 seems most principled as it:\n1. Creates immediate counterplay\n2. Prepares potential h4-h3 push to challenge White's pawns\n3. Doesn't weaken Black's position\n4. Maintains flexibility for the king\n\n```\nh6h5\n```"
