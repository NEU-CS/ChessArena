When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and the board looks like this:\n\n```\n8 | . . . . . . . .\n7 | . . . . . . . .\n6 | . . . . . . k .\n5 | . b . K . . . .\n4 | . P . . . . . .\n3 | . . . . . . . .\n2 | . . P . . . . .\n1 | . . . . . . . .\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **Black King** is on g6, quite centralized.\n- **White King** is on d5, also active.\n- **Black Bishop** is on b5, currently pinning the white pawn on c4 (if it were still there), but now it's just a piece trying to influence the game.\n- **White has pawns** on b4 and c3, and a potential passed pawn on the queenside.\n- Black\u2019s goal should be to either:\n  - Stop White from promoting their pawns.\n  - Create counterplay with the bishop or king.\n  - Possibly triangulate to make progress.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `g6-h7`: Retreats king toward the corner \u2014 not ideal.\n- `g6-g7`: Centralizes king slightly more.\n- `g6-f7`: Brings king closer to center and supports possible ...f5 ideas.\n- `g6-h6`: Slightly passive.\n- `g6-f6`: Very good \u2014 brings king into the center and prepares to challenge White\u2019s king.\n- `g6-h5`: Too far forward, possibly risky.\n- `g6-g5`: Also good \u2014 challenges White\u2019s king directly.\n- `g6-f5`: Very strong \u2014 puts king in the thick of the action, eyeing e4 and supporting ...f5 push.\n\n#### Bishop moves:\n- `b5-e8`, `b5-d7`, `b5-c6`, `b5-a6`: These are mostly retreating or repositioning the bishop, but they don\u2019t immediately threaten anything.\n- `b5-c4`: Captures on c4 would be bad because it gives White a protected passed pawn on c3.\n- `b5-a4`: Could try to pressure the queenside, but not very effective here.\n- `b5-d3`, `b5-e2`, `b5-f1`: All very passive or even losing.\n\n### Best Plan:\n\nThe best plan for Black is to **activate the king** and **challenge White\u2019s control of the center**. The most active and logical move is:\n\n### `g6-f5`\n\nThis move:\n- Places the king in the center.\n- Eyes the key squares e4 and d4.\n- Prepares to support a potential ...f5 break.\n- Forces White to respond carefully.\n\nIt\u2019s the most dynamic and challenging move available.\n\n---\n\n```\ng6f5\n```"
