When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has strong threats:\n   - Qc6 is attacking the rook on e8\n   - Bb4 is pinning the a2 queen to the king\n   - Rf3 is eyeing the f7 pawn\n3. Black's immediate concerns:\n   - Need to deal with the threat to the rook on e8\n   - Need to address the pin on the a2 queen\n   - Need to find counterplay\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- e8e7: Moves the rook away from attack but leaves other problems\n- a2e6: Queen moves to defend e8 rook but still leaves pin\n- a2a6: Queen moves to unpin but abandons defense of e8 rook\n- b6c5: Bishop moves to unpin but doesn't address rook threat\n- e8e1: Rook moves to safety but allows Qxe1+\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be e8e7, moving the rook to safety while keeping other pieces defended. While not ideal, it's the least bad option in a difficult position.\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
