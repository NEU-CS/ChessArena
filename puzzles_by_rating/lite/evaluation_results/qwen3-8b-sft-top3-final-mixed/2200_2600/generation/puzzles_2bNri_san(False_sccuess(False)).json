When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Bishop, Bishop vs Black's Rook, Knight, Bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White's rook on e1 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on g4 that could become dangerous\n- White's bishop on g3 is very strong, controlling key squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3e5: Bishop checks the king, forcing it to move\n- e1e6: Rook checks the king, also forcing it to move\n- c2f5: Bishop develops with tempo, attacking the knight\n- f2f4: Challenging the dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Best continuation seems to be g3e5+:\n- Forces the black king to move (only legal reply is Kf6-e7)\n- After Ke7, we can play e1e6+ winning the knight on f5\n- This leads to a favorable endgame with rook vs bishop\n\nOther moves:\n- e1e6+ immediately allows Kf6xe6, which isn't as strong\n- c2f5 is good but doesn't create immediate threats\n- f2f4 is too slow and allows Black counterplay\n\nThe most forcing and advantageous line is through the bishop check:\n\n```\ng3e5\n```"
