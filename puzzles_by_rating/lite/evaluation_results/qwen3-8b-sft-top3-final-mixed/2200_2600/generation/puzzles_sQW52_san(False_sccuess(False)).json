When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is stuck in the center (on c2)\n- Black has a strong bishop pair and active pieces\n- White's knight on d6 is very strong, but can be challenged\n- Black's queen on e7 is well placed, eyeing the f2 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7f6: Attacks the strong knight on d6 and threatens mate on f2\n- h6g5: Develops the bishop with tempo, attacking the queen\n- d8h8: Rook lift to potentially double on the h-file\n- e7h4: Queen swing to attack the weak f2 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7f6:\n- Immediately challenges the strong knight on d6\n- If Nxf6, then Qxf6+ wins the queen (Kd3 Qxf2+)\n- If White moves the knight, we maintain pressure\n- Creates threats against f2 which is only defended by the king\n\nOther moves like h6g5 are also good, but e7f6 is more forcing and creates immediate threats.\n\n```\ne7f6\n```"
