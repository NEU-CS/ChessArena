When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, rook, pawns. Black has queen, rook, bishop, rook, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on f4 is very active, attacking the black rook on g6\n- Black's queen on b4 is threatening the pawn on a2\n- Black has two rooks that could become active\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4f7: Queen takes rook with check, but after ...Kd7 the queen is trapped\n- f4h6: Queen takes rook, but allows ...Qxa2 winning a pawn\n- e5e6: Pawn push attacking the bishop, but allows ...Qxa2\n- c1c8: Rook lift to attack the black king, but allows ...Qxa2\n- g3g4: Pushing the pawn to create luft for the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be f4f7:\n- It wins the exchange (queen for rook)\n- After ...Kd7, we can play Qxg6+ Kc8 Qxg7 with a winning position\n- Black's compensation with the bishop is not enough\n- Other moves either lose material or don't capitalize on the active queen\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nf4f7\n```"
