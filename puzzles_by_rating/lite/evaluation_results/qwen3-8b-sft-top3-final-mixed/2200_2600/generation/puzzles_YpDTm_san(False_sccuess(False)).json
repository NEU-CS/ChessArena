When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: King on d6, pawn on a6 and h4, rook on a3\n- **Black**: King on h6, pawn on d4 and h7, rook on c2\n\n### Goals for Black:\n- Try to promote the d-pawn or h-pawn.\n- Avoid losing the rook or getting into a stalemate.\n- Be careful of White's king activity and potential threats.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `h6g7`: Centralizes the king slightly, but not very useful.\n- `h6g6`: Brings king closer to center, possibly supporting d-pawn.\n- `h6h5`: Advances king forward, could support h-pawn push.\n\n#### Rook moves:\n- `c2c8`, `c2c7`, `c2c6`, `c2c5`, `c2c4`, `c2c3`: Various vertical rook moves; some may be useful to attack pawns or control files.\n- `c2h2`: Attacks h4 pawn directly.\n- `c2g2`, `c2f2`, `c2e2`, `c2d2`, `c2b2`, `c2a2`: Horizontal rook moves; some might help in controlling files or attacking pawns.\n- `c2c1`: Retreats rook, not ideal unless necessary.\n- `d4d3`: Pushes the d-pawn forward, trying to create a passed pawn.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe most promising move seems to be **`d4d3`**.\n\nWhy?\n\n- It creates a **passed pawn** on d3, which can potentially promote.\n- The White king is on d6, so it can't immediately stop the pawn.\n- If White tries to stop the pawn with the rook (Ra3-d3), then Black can play Rc2-c3+ and force the White king away from the critical squares.\n- This gives Black a real chance to promote the pawn and win the game.\n\nOther options like moving the rook or king are less effective because they don't create immediate threats or improve Black's chances as much as pushing the d-pawn.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\nd4d3\n```"
