When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black has a strong bishop pair and active pieces, while White's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with potential threats\n4. White has a passed pawn on f4 that could become dangerous\n5. Black's queen on b6 is eyeing the b2 pawn and could create threats\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's bishop on b5 is very strong, controlling important diagonals\n- White's knight on g3 is well placed but needs to find a good square\n- The f1 rook is undeveloped and needs activation\n- White's king is relatively safe but could be improved\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g3h5 - Knight jump to h5, attacking f6 and threatening to fork on g7\n2. f1c4 - Developing the rook to an active diagonal\n3. d1h5 - Queen move to h5, increasing pressure on h-file\n4. c1c4 - Developing the bishop to a more active square\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- g3h5 looks tempting but after ...Bxh5, White doesn't get enough compensation\n- f1c4 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- d1h5 is interesting but Black can defend with ...Qe6\n- c1c4 is the most flexible, developing a piece while keeping options open\n\nThe best move appears to be c1c4, developing the bishop to a strong diagonal where it:\n- Eyes the f7 pawn\n- Puts pressure on Black's queenside\n- Can potentially support the f4 pawn's advance\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\n```\nc1c4\n```"
