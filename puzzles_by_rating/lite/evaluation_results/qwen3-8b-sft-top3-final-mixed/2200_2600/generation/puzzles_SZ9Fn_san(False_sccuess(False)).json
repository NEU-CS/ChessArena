When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a knight and queen; Black has a bishop and queen.\n- **King Safety**: Both kings are relatively safe, but White\u2019s king is more centralized.\n- **Threats**:\n  - White\u2019s queen on f6 is eyeing the black king along the 6th rank and could threaten mate if not careful.\n  - Black\u2019s queen on g4 is active and can create threats against the white king or pawns.\n- **Black\u2019s Bishop on d4** is very strong, controlling key diagonals and supporting potential attacks.\n- **Black\u2019s King on g6** is somewhat exposed, but not immediately in danger.\n- **White\u2019s Knight on e7** is deep in enemy territory and could be a tactical target.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\nWe'll evaluate some of the legal moves based on their potential:\n\n### 1. `g4c8` \u2013 Queen takes rook (if there was one), but no piece on c8. Not useful.\n### 2. `g4d7` \u2013 Queen to d7, attacking the knight on e7. This looks promising.\n   - If White plays `Ne7-f5`, then `Qd7xe7` wins a piece.\n   - Also threatens the bishop on d4 via discovered attack if the knight moves.\n### 3. `g4e6` \u2013 Queen to e6, attacking the queen on f6 directly.\n   - Could lead to a trade of queens, which might simplify into a drawn endgame.\n   - But after `Qxe6 Qxe6`, Black loses initiative.\n### 4. `g4g5` \u2013 Queen to g5, pressuring the white king.\n   - Might set up a mating net with ...h5-h4+ later.\n   - However, White can respond with `Qxg5+` and win the queen.\n### 5. `d4e3` \u2013 Bishop to e3, pinning the pawn on f2 to the king.\n   - Very strong! This creates a **pin** and threatens to win material.\n   - After `Bxe3`, White must recapture with `f2xe3`, opening the f-file and weakening the king.\n   - Then Black can follow up with `Qg4-g3+` or `Qg4-f4+`, gaining tempo and possibly winning the rook on a1 or further material.\n\nThis move seems to have the most concrete follow-up and pressure.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\n\nAfter evaluating all options, **`d4e3`** stands out as the most forcing and strongest move. It exploits the pin, forces White to weaken their structure, and opens lines for Black\u2019s queen to attack.\n\n```\nd4e3\n```"
