When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a passed pawn on c5 that is blockaded by White's king\n3. Black has another passed pawn on f4 that is blockaded by White's g3 pawn\n4. White's king is well-placed to support the b-pawn's promotion\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b7b8q - promoting immediately to queen\n2. b5a6 - moving king to attack c5 pawn\n3. d5d6 - advancing the d-pawn\n\nLet's evaluate:\n- b7b8q seems most straightforward, but after ...f3 White must be careful not to allow Black's f-pawn to promote\n- b5a6 is interesting as it threatens to capture the c5 pawn, but Black can defend with ...Kb6\n- d5d6 is premature as it doesn't address the immediate promotion opportunity\n\nThe most forcing and decisive move is to promote immediately. After b7b8q, Black's best try is ...f3, but White can respond with g3xf3, and even if Black promotes with ...c4, White's queen can easily stop it while White's king races to support the d-pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb7b8q\n```"
