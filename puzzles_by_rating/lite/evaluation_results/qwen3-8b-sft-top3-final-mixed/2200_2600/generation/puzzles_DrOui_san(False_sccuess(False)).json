When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black has a bishop on c5 that's very active, pinning the f4 pawn to the king\n3. White's knight on d5 is very strong, centralized and threatening\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n5. Black has a knight on g4 that's forking White's f2 pawn and potentially threatening the king\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on d5 is under attack by Black's bishop on c5\n- We need to either move the knight or defend it\n- The most forcing move is d5e7, attacking the rook on f8 and forcing Black to respond\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d5e7 - attacks rook, forces Black to deal with the threat\n2. d5f6 - attacks the bishop on c5 and threatens discovered checks\n3. c4a6 - develops bishop but doesn't address immediate threats\n4. f1f3 - defends against the knight fork but passive\n\nAfter considering:\n- d5e7 is very strong as it forces Black to either move the rook (losing tempo) or block with the queen, which would be awkward\n- d5f6 is also interesting but Black can simply take with the bishop (Bxf6)\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threats as effectively\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be d5e7, putting immediate pressure on Black's position.\n\n```\nd5e7\n```"
