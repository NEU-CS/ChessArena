When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and rooks)\n2. Black has a strong knight on f6 and bishop on d7 eyeing the white king\n3. White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n4. Black has pressure on the d5 square with queen and knight\n5. White has a passed pawn on b5 that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's knight on f6 is very strong and needs to be challenged\n- The d5 square is a key central point that needs control\n- White's rook on e1 is active but could be better placed\n- The bishop on f3 is blocked by its own pawn on d2\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c3d5 - Challenges the knight and controls d5, but after ...Nxd5 Bxd5 Qxd5, black gets active play\n2. f3d5 - Similar to above but leaves the bishop more active\n3. e1e8 - Rook lift to attack the back rank, but black can defend with ...Qxe8\n4. b5c6 - Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n5. d1d3 - Developing the queen and connecting rooks\n\nAfter careful consideration, c3d5 seems most principled:\n- It challenges black's strong knight\n- Gains control of the central d5 square\n- Opens lines for white's pieces\n- Even if black takes (Nxd5), Bxd5 Qxd5 leaves white with active pieces\n\nOther moves either don't address the central tension or allow black to maintain pressure.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
