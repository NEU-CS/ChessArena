When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

It threatens **Qxg2#** (checkmate) unless something stops it.\n- There is a discovered attack possibility if the bishop on g7 moves \u2014 because the rook on f8 would then be able to attack along the file.\n- The white queen on h5 is eyeing the diagonal toward g6 and possibly f7, but currently not an immediate threat.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWe must prioritize stopping **Qxg2#**. Let's look at ways to defend g2 or remove the threat.\n\n#### 1. **...Qxf3** \u2013 Captures a knight, removes the defender of g2, and keeps pressure.\n- After `...Qxf3`, White cannot play `Qxg2#` anymore.\n- Also gains material (knight).\n- Seems like a strong candidate.\n\n#### 2. **...Qxg2+** \u2013 Immediate check, but after `Kxg2`, Black loses the queen for no compensation.\n- Not good.\n\n#### 3. **...Qe3+** \u2013 Checks the king, but again, after `Kh1`, nothing concrete follows.\n- Doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\n\n#### 4. **...Qxh2+** \u2013 Tempting, but after `Kxh2`, again, queen is lost for nothing.\n- No gain.\n\n#### 5. **...Qxf3** \u2013 Best so far; captures a piece and removes the mating threat.\n\nOther moves like moving the rook (`Rf8-e8`, etc.) or bishop (`Bg7-h6`, etc.) don\u2019t address the immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe best move here is **...Qxf3**, capturing the knight and removing the threat of checkmate while gaining material.\n\n```\nf2f3\n```"
