When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's knight on c5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinned to the king by White's knight\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- Both sides have passed pawns (Black's d5 vs White's a5)\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7d8: King moves away from potential knight forks\n- g4f5: Bishop moves to break the pin\n- e6e5: Pawn push to gain space\n- d5d4: Pawn push to create a passed pawn\n\n4. Critical considerations:\n- The bishop is pinned and needs to be dealt with\n- White's knight can create threats against Black's king\n- Black needs to activate his pieces while restraining White's\n\nAfter evaluating:\n- g4f5 seems best as it breaks the pin immediately while developing the bishop to a more active square\n- Other moves either leave the bishop pinned or don't address the immediate threats\n- After g4f5, Black can consider pushing pawns or activating the king\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ng4f5\n```"
