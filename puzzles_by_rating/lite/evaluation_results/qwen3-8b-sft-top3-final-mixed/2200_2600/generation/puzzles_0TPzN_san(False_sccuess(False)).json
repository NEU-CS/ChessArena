When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b7 is very active, attacking the rook on a8 and threatening to capture the bishop on d6.\n- Black's queen on h4 is very dangerous, eyeing the h2 pawn and potentially threatening mate on h1.\n- White's knight on f7 is forked between the rook on h8 and bishop on d6.\n- Black's king is exposed on d7.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7h8: Capturing the rook, but after ...Qxh8 White's position remains dangerous due to Black's queen.\n- f7d8: Capturing the bishop, but allows ...Qxd8 and Black's queen becomes too active.\n- b7a8: Capturing the rook, but after ...Qxa8 White's knight is still under attack.\n- b7c8: Protecting the knight while attacking the bishop, but allows ...Qxc8.\n- c3d5: Developing the bishop with tempo, attacking the queen.\n\n4. Best move appears to be c3d5:\n- Attacks Black's queen, forcing it to move\n- After ...Qg5 (most likely), White can play Qxd6, winning a bishop\n- Even if Black finds ...Qf5, White has Qxd6 with a strong position\n- Maintains control over the dangerous h4 queen\n\nOther moves either allow Black's queen too much activity or don't maximize White's advantages.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
