When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, knight and pawns vs White's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on g5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- White's rook on e2 is very active\n- Black's knight on e3 is well placed but could be trapped\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rxe3 next move, winning the knight\n- White could push g6, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h8h7: Protects against Rxe3 by covering e7\n- e3g4: Moves the knight to safety while attacking f2\n- c6d6: Moves the king to a safer square\n- e5e4: Pushes the pawn to gain space\n\nAfter considering these options, e3g4 seems most appealing because:\n- It saves the knight from being captured\n- It attacks f2, forcing White to respond\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n- It doesn't allow White to push the g-pawn immediately\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. For example, h8h7 allows Rxe3, and c6d6 doesn't solve the knight issue.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3g4\n```"
