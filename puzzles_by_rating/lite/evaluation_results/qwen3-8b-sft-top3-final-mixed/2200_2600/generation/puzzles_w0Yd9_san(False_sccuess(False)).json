Black has a king on f6 and a pawn on g5.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite wants to promote the e-pawn or prevent Black from promoting their g-pawn.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- The position is very delicate.\n- White\u2019s king is slightly more centralized than Black\u2019s.\n- Black\u2019s king is closer to the center and can potentially support the g-pawn.\n- White must act quickly to either advance the e-pawn or restrict Black\u2019s options.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n- `e4d5` \u2013 King moves toward the center and supports the e-pawn.\n- `e4d4` \u2013 King steps back, not ideal.\n- `e4f3` \u2013 King moves toward the kingside, possibly supporting a future e3-e2 push.\n- `e4d3` \u2013 King moves away from the action.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n#### `e4d5`:\n- This move brings the king closer to the center and supports the e-pawn.\n- It also restricts Black\u2019s king by limiting its access to e6 and e5.\n- After `e4d5`, White can follow up with `e3-e4` to gain space and control key squares.\n- This move keeps maximum flexibility and pressure.\n\n#### Other moves (`e4d4`, `e4f3`, `e4d3`) are less effective because:\n- They either retreat the king or move it in a direction that doesn\u2019t help control the center or support the pawn.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is **`e4d5`**, which improves the king\u2019s position and gives White the best chance to win.\n\n```\ne4d5\n```"

Black has a king on f6 and a pawn on g4.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite wants to promote the e-pawn or prevent Black from promoting their g-pawn. The key is to control the critical squares around the pawns.\n\n### Current Position Summary:\n\n- **White King**: d5\n- **Black King**: f6\n- **White Pawn**: e3\n- **Black Pawn**: g4\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `d5d6` \u2013 King moves forward\n- `d5c6` \u2013 King moves diagonally toward the queenside\n- `d5c5` \u2013 King moves left\n- `d5e4` \u2013 King moves down\n- `d5d4` \u2013 King moves backward\n- `d5c4` \u2013 King moves diagonally backward\n- `e3e4` \u2013 Pawn advances\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Moves:\n\n#### 1. **e3e4** \u2013 Pushing the pawn\n- This is a strong move because it advances the pawn closer to promotion.\n- It also restricts the Black king\u2019s access to e5 and d5.\n- After `e3e4`, the pawn is now on e4, and the White king can support it.\n- Black will likely respond with `Kf6-e5` to try to stop the pawn.\n- Then White can play `Ke5-d6` or `Kd5-e5` depending on how things unfold.\n\n#### 2. **d5d6**\n- King moves forward, but this doesn't help much unless supported by the pawn.\n- Black can respond with `Kf6-e5`, attacking the pawn and gaining tempo.\n\n#### 3. **d5c6 / d5c5 / d5c4**\n- These moves take the king away from the center and the pawn, which is not ideal in this type of endgame.\n\n#### 4. **d5e4**\n- King moves down, supporting the pawn directly.\n- This is a very solid move, keeping the king close to the pawn and preparing to escort it forward.\n\n#### 5. **d5d4 / d5c4**\n- Moving backward or diagonally backward gives up control of key squares and allows Black to make progress.\n\n---\n\n### Best Plan:\nThe best plan is to **advance the pawn with `e3e4`**, while keeping the king nearby to support its promotion. This creates a passed pawn and limits Black\u2019s counterplay.\n\nAfter `e3e4`, if Black plays `Kf6-e5`, then White can respond with `Kd5-e5`, locking the kings and forcing Black to give way.\n\nThis is a textbook example of a winning king and pawn endgame where White can force a win with precise play.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n```\ne3e4\n```"
