When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have 4 pawns and a king)\n2. White's king is more active (on d4 vs Black's king on f7)\n3. White has a passed pawn on c5, which could become dangerous\n4. Black's pawns are mostly blocked or restricted:\n   - a6 pawn is blocked by b4\n   - b7 pawn is blocked by c5\n   - c6 pawn is blocked by d5\n   - f6 pawn is blocked by e5\n   - h6 pawn is blocked by g5\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to activate the king to stop White's passed pawn\n- Need to create counterplay with our own pawns\n- Need to prevent White from advancing their pawns freely\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f7g8 - King moves towards the center but away from the queenside\n2. f7f8 - King stays passive\n3. f7e8 - King moves towards the center but still not optimal\n4. f7e7 - King moves towards the center and queenside\n5. g7g6 - Creates luft but doesn't address main issues\n6. b7b6 - Pushes pawn but allows cxb6\n7. h6h5 - Pushes pawn but doesn't help much\n8. a6a5 - Pushes pawn but allows bxa5\n9. g7g5 - Pushes pawn but weakens kingside\n10. b7b5 - Pushes pawn but allows cxb5\n\nBest move seems to be f7e7, bringing the king closer to both the center and the queenside where White's passed pawn is. This prepares to potentially support our pawns or stop White's pawn advances.\n\n```\nf7e7\n```"
