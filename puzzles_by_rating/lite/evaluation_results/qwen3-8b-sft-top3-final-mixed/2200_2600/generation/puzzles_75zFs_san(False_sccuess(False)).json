When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (rook, bishop, knight, pawns each). Black has a slight space advantage with more advanced pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on b1, which could be dangerous\n- Black has a knight on a4 eyeing b2 and c3 squares\n- White's rook on e1 is semi-open but could be more active\n- Black's bishop on f7 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3b8: Bishop sacrifice to open the a-file, but seems premature\n- g3e5: Centralizing the bishop, attacking f6 knight\n- e1e3: Rook lift to support the center\n- c2a4: Trading the knight, but gives up control of b3\n- e4e5: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n\n4. Best options:\n- g3e5 looks strong, centralizing the bishop and putting pressure on f6\n- e1e3 is solid, preparing to double rooks or support the center\n- c2a4 is interesting but may not be best\n\nAfter considering these, g3e5 seems most promising as it:\n- Centralizes the bishop\n- Puts pressure on f6 knight\n- Opens potential for future rook activity on the e-file\n- Maintains control of key squares\n\nThe move also prevents Black from playing ...f5 to challenge the center.\n\n```\ng3e5\n```"
