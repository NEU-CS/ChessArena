When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has king + pawns (f5, h4, g3). Black has king + pawns (a2, b3, g5, h6). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is more active (b1) vs Black's king (f5)\n- Black has connected passed pawns on a2 and b3\n- White has a passed pawn on f5\n- Black's h6 pawn is weak and could be targeted\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- b1c2: King moves towards Black's pawns, but allows ...a1=Q\n- b1a2: Captures the a2 pawn, but after ...bxa2, Black's b-pawn becomes dangerous\n- e5e6: Advances the passed pawn, but Black can respond with ...fxe6\n- g3g4: Creates a passed pawn and threatens to advance it\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- g3g4 is very strong because:\n  - It creates a passed pawn that can't be stopped (h5 is covered by f5)\n  - After g4, Black can't take (h6xg4 would be met with f5-f6)\n  - The pawn can advance to g5, creating serious threats\n  - It also prevents Black from playing ...h5 to block the f-pawn\n\nThe other moves either allow Black to promote or don't create immediate threats. g3g4 is the most forcing and creates decisive winning chances.\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
