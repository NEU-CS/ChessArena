If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook on c1, a king on g4, and pawns on b3, f5, and h5. White has a rook on f2, a king on d3, and pawns on b2, g3, and h2.\n\nBlack to move.\n\n---\n\n## Key Observations:\n\n- **Material is roughly equal**, with both sides having a rook and several pawns.\n- Black\u2019s king is quite active, currently on g4.\n- White\u2019s king is on d3, also centrally placed.\n- The black rook on c1 is somewhat passive but can become active depending on how the position unfolds.\n- There are no immediate tactical threats, but there may be chances for simplification or pawn breaks.\n- Black has a **passed pawn on b3**, which could be dangerous if supported properly.\n- Black also has a **potential passed pawn on the h-file** (h5), though it's not very advanced yet.\n- The white rook on f2 is eyeing the second rank and could potentially threaten checks or support a pawn push.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n### King moves:\n- `g4g5`: Advances the king forward. Could help support the h5 pawn or prepare to march toward the center. Seems reasonable.\n- `g4h3`: Brings the king closer to the h-file pawns. Might help push h5-h4 later. Also reasonable.\n\n### Rook moves:\n- `c1c8`, `c1c7`, `c1c6`, `c1c5`, `c1c4`, `c1c3`, `c1c2`: These are all vertical rook moves along the c-file. Most of them don\u2019t achieve much immediately unless preparing to double rooks or target something specific.\n- `c1h1`, `c1g1`, `c1f1`, `c1e1`, `c1d1`, `c1b1`, `c1a1`: Horizontal rook moves. Again, most are not immediately useful unless targeting something on those files.\n\n### Pawn moves:\n- `h5h4`: A quiet but useful move that fixes the h-pawn structure and prepares to advance it further. It also prevents White from playing g3-g4 easily.\n- `f5f4`: A more aggressive pawn break. This opens up lines and creates space. It might be too risky without proper support, though.\n\n---\n\n## Best Plan:\n\nBlack should aim to **activate the rook**, possibly by moving it to an open file or preparing to double rooks. However, since this is a quiet position, we should look for **quiet improvements**.\n\nThe most useful move here is likely **`c1c3`**, which:\n- Activates the rook.\n- Eyes the third rank where White\u2019s king is located.\n- Prepares to potentially double rooks on the c-file or support the b3 pawn.\n- Keeps options open for future play.\n\nIt\u2019s a flexible and improving move.\n\n---\n\n## Final Move:\n\n```\nc1c3\n```"
