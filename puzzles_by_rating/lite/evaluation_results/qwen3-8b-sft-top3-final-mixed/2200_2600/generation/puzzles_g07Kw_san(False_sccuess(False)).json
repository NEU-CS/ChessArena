When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on a7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank\n- Black's rook on b2 is passive but can become active\n- Black's king is exposed on e6\n- White's king is relatively safe on f3\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Ra8 next move, threatening to win the f6 pawn\n- White could also play Rxb2, winning the exchange\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b2b8: Blocks the rook's path to f8 and defends f6 pawn\n- b2b7: Attacks the a7 rook but allows Ra8\n- e6d5: King moves away from potential checks but leaves f6 pawn undefended\n- h6h5: Creates luft but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n5. Best move seems to be b2b8:\n- Defends the f6 pawn\n- Prevents Ra8\n- Keeps the rook active on the 8th rank\n- If White takes with Rxb8, Kxb8 and Black's king becomes more active\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new weaknesses. b2b8 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\nb2b8\n```"
