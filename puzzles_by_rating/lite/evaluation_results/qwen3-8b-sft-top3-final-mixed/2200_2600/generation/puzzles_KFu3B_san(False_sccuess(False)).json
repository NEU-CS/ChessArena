When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has two connected passed pawns on a5 and b5\n3. Black's king is on d5, White's king is on e3\n4. It's White's move (51st move)\n\nThe critical factors:\n- Black's pawns are more advanced and dangerous\n- White's e-pawn is passed but needs support to advance\n- White's king must balance between stopping Black's pawns and supporting White's pawns\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. e3f4 - King moves toward Black's pawns but leaves e5 pawn undefended\n2. e3f3 - Similar to f4, not improving much\n3. e3d3 - Gets closer to Black's pawns but still leaves e5 pawn\n4. e3f2 - Retreats, not helpful\n5. e3e2 - Retreats, not helpful\n6. e3d2 - Retreats, not helpful\n7. e5e6 - Advances the passed pawn, but Black can respond with ...Kd6 stopping it\n8. b3b4 - Challenges Black's pawns immediately\n\nThe most critical move is b3b4! because:\n- It stops Black from advancing their pawns with ...b4\n- After b4, if Black takes axb4, White can play Kd4 attacking the b4 pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can push b5 next move\n- This is the only move that creates counterplay against Black's dangerous pawns\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or allow Black to advance their pawns too quickly.\n\n```\nb3b4\n```"
