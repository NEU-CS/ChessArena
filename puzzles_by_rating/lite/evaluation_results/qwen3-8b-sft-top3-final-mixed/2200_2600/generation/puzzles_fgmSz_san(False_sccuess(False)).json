When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Q, B, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Q, R, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h4 is very active, eyeing the h7 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on f5 is active but could be vulnerable\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f6f7: King moves forward, but into potential checks from White's queen\n- f6g6: King moves towards the corner, but still exposed\n- f6e6: King moves towards center, but may be safer\n- f5g5: Rook moves to attack the bishop, but allows Qxh7\n- g7g5: Pawn push, but weakens the kingside\n\n4. Best move considerations:\n- Need to protect against Qxh7 which would win a pawn\n- f5g5 seems tempting to attack the bishop, but after Qxh7, White is better\n- f6e6 seems safest, moving the king away from checks while keeping options open\n- g7g5 weakens the pawn structure too much\n\nAfter careful consideration, f6e6 is the most prudent move, keeping the king safe while maintaining flexibility. The other moves either expose the king too much or allow White to gain material advantage.\n\n```\nf6e6\n```"
