When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, queen vs White's rook, bishop, queen). However, White's queen is more active on g5.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on c5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with White's queen eyeing it\n- Black's bishop on f5 is very active, controlling key squares\n- White's bishop on d3 is pinning Black's pawn on e5 to the queen\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg6+ winning the bishop\n- White could also play Qxf5 winning the bishop\n- White might push c6 to create a passed pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5g6: Defends against Qxg6+ but allows Qxf5\n- f6g6: Blocks the queen's path to g6 but leaves f5 undefended\n- f5d7: Retreats the bishop to safety while maintaining control\n- f6e7: Moves the queen to defend the bishop\n- g8h8: King moves away from potential checks\n\nAfter careful consideration, f5g6 seems the most resilient:\n- It prevents Qxg6+ while maintaining the bishop\n- If White takes Qxf5, we can recapture with Qxf5\n- It keeps our pieces active and coordinated\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow White to gain too much initiative.\n\n```\nf5g6\n```"
