When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on a7, eyeing the g1 square\n- White's queen is on h8, which is somewhat awkward but can be repositioned\n- Black has connected passed pawns on f4 and g5\n- White has pawns on c4 and e4 that could become targets\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...Qa1+ winning the g2 pawn\n- Black's pawns are dangerous if they advance\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Queen moves: Need to keep the queen active while defending against threats\n- King moves: f3g4 looks interesting to get away from checks\n- Pawn moves: Need to be careful about creating weaknesses\n\nAfter considering:\n- h8a1 looks tempting to block the queen check, but after ...Qxa1+ Kxa1, Black's pawns become too strong\n- f3g4 seems best to get the king to safety while keeping options open\n- Other queen moves either don't address the threats or leave the king exposed\n\nThe most resilient move appears to be moving the king to g4, getting away from potential checks and preparing to support the pawns.\n\n```\nf3g4\n```"
