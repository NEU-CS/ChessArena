When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 that's blockaded by White's pawn on e4\n- White's queen is very active and can potentially create threats\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's king is safe on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: a2a8 looks tempting as it threatens mate on g8, but Black can defend with ...Kf7\n- Pawn moves: f4f5 could be interesting to gain space, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- King moves: g1h2 might be useful to connect rooks (though we don't have rooks here) or prepare for potential endgame\n\n4. Best move seems to be a2a8, creating an immediate threat of mate on g8. Even though Black can defend with ...Kf7, this forces Black to react and gives White the initiative. Other queen moves don't create such immediate threats.\n\nAfter a2a8, if Black plays ...Kf7, White can consider Qf8+ forcing the king to move again, maintaining pressure.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\na2a8\n```"
