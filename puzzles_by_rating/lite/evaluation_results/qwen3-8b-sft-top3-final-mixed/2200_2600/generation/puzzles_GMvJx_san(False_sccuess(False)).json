When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has king + 2 pawns vs Black's king + 3 pawns. Material is equal, but pawn structure is important.\n\n2. Pawn structure:\n- White has pawns on a3, b4, h2\n- Black has pawns on a6, b5, g5\n- White's pawns are more advanced but somewhat isolated\n- Black's pawns are connected but less advanced\n\n3. King position:\n- White king is on f2, somewhat centralized\n- Black king is on f4, very active and close to White's pawns\n\n4. Immediate threats:\n- Black's king is threatening to capture White's h2 pawn (Kxh2)\n- White needs to either defend h2 or create counterplay\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f2g2: Moves king towards h2 pawn, defends it\n- f2e2: Moves king away from action, not helpful\n- f2g1/f2f1/f2e1: Retreats king, not useful\n- a3a4: Advances queenside pawn, but doesn't address immediate threat\n- h2h3: Creates a passed pawn but allows Kxh3\n- h2h4: Advances pawn but doesn't solve the problem\n\nThe best move is f2g2, bringing the king to defend the h2 pawn while also potentially supporting the advance of the h-pawn later. This maintains material equality and prevents Black from capturing the h2 pawn immediately.\n\n```\nf2g2\n```"
