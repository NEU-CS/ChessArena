You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: Rook (d6), Bishop (g5), Pawn (e7), King (f3)\n- **Black**: Rook (e4), Bishop (d4), Pawn (b5, d5, g6), King (g7)\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White has a dangerous passed pawn on **e7**, one move away from queening.\n- Black\u2019s king is in the corner but can still act.\n- Black\u2019s rook on e4 is active and can target the white king or support counterplay.\n- Black\u2019s bishop on d4 is well-placed, controlling key diagonals.\n- Black has a pawn majority on the queenside (b5, d5 vs. White\u2019s e7).\n- The black king is relatively safe for now.\n\n### Immediate Threat:\nWhite threatens to play **e8=Q**, promoting the pawn. This must be addressed.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `g7h8`: King to h8 \u2013 passive, doesn\u2019t help stop e7-e8.\n- `g7g8`: King to g8 \u2013 also passive.\n- `g7h7`: King to h7 \u2013 slightly more active, but not useful.\n- `g7f7`: King to f7 \u2013 **very strong!** This attacks the e7 pawn directly and prevents its promotion.\n\n#### Rook moves:\n- `e4e7`: Rook captures on e7 \u2013 removes the dangerous pawn, but gives up the rook for a pawn. Not ideal unless necessary.\n- Other rook moves (`e4e6`, `e4e5`, etc.) don\u2019t address the immediate threat.\n\n#### Bishop moves:\n- `d4a7`, `d4f6`, etc.: Most of these are long-range and don\u2019t help stop e7-e8.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- `b5b4`: Advances the pawn, but doesn\u2019t stop e7-e8.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\nThe most urgent task is to **stop the e7 pawn from promoting**. The best way to do that is to play:\n\n```\ng7f7\n```\n\nThis move:\n- Brings the king to f7, attacking the e7 pawn.\n- Prevents White from playing e8=Q.\n- Keeps all other options open for Black.\n\nIt\u2019s active, logical, and stops the biggest threat.\n\n---\n\n```\ng7f7\n```"

B .\n. . . b r .\n........\n........\n........\n```\n\nBlack is to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: King on f3, Rook on d5, Bishop on g5\n- **Black**: King on f7, Rook on e4, Bishop on d4, Pawn on b5, g6\n\n### Observations:\n- Black has a rook and bishop vs. rook and bishop, but White has a dangerous passed pawn on the 7th rank (f7).\n- The Black king is in the corner, but not immediately under threat.\n- The White king is active and can support the f-pawn.\n- Black\u2019s rook on e4 is very active, and the bishop on d4 is also well-placed.\n- Black must be careful not to allow White to promote the f-pawn.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nLet's evaluate the most promising options for Black:\n\n#### 1. `f7g8` \u2013 King moves to g8\n- This avoids potential checks from the White bishop on g5.\n- It centralizes the king slightly.\n- Not bad, but passive.\n\n#### 2. `f7e8` \u2013 King to e8\n- Centralizes the king.\n- Might help in supporting counterplay or stopping the f-pawn.\n- Also reasonable.\n\n#### 3. `e4e7` \u2013 Rook to e7\n- Attacks the f7 pawn directly.\n- Forces White to respond.\n- Very strong move: it puts pressure on the f7 pawn and threatens to win it.\n- If White plays `f7f8q`, then `e7xf8` wins the queen for a rook.\n\n#### 4. `e4e6` \u2013 Rook to e6\n- Also attacks the f7 pawn.\n- Less direct than `e4e7`.\n\n#### 5. `e4e5` \u2013 Rook to e5\n- Defends the bishop on d4.\n- Not aggressive.\n\n#### 6. `d4e5` \u2013 Bishop to e5\n- Attacks the rook on d5.\n- Could lead to exchanges.\n- But gives White time to push f7-f8=Q.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe most forcing and strongest move is:\n\n```\ne4e7\n```\n\nThis move attacks the f7 pawn directly, forcing White to either defend or advance it. If White promotes, Black captures with the rook and gains material. If White defends, Black can continue to press.\n\n---\n\n```\ne4e7\n```"
