When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, queen, rook, and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen, and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on a4 is very active, eyeing the h1 square\n- Black's queen on h5 is threatening, but currently not attacking anything critical\n- White's knight on d4 is centralized and powerful\n- Black's king is exposed on b8 with limited pawn cover\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's queen could potentially deliver mate on h1 if given the chance\n- White needs to be careful about back rank threats\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a4e8: Queen sacrifice to win the rook on h8, but after ...Qxe8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- d4e6: Forking queen and rook, but Black can play ...Qxe6\n- a6b7: Bishop sacrifice to open the a-file, but not immediately decisive\n- c1c7: Rook lift to attack the king, but Black can defend\n\n5. Best move seems to be a4e8!:\n- It's a queen sacrifice, but after:\n  - ...Qxe8\n  - d4e6! (forking queen and rook)\n  - ...Qxe6\n  - c1c8+ (winning the rook on h8)\n  - ...Kxc8\n  - a6b7 (discovered check) winning the bishop on d7\n\nThis leads to a winning endgame where White will have rook and bishop vs rook and pawns.\n\n```\na4e8\n```"
