When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on e4\n- White's bishop is very active on f6\n- Black has a passed pawn on c6 that could become dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: f6h8 (threatening mate), f6g7 (attacking h6 pawn), f6e5 (centralizing)\n- King moves: h4g5 (approaching center), h4g3 (safe but passive)\n- Pawn moves: a3a4 (advancing passed pawn), g2g3/g4 (improving king safety)\n\n4. Critical threats:\n- Black's bishop on d1 is eyeing the b3 pawn\n- Black could play ...c5 at some point to push the passed pawn\n\n5. Best move considerations:\n- f6h8 threatens mate in 1 (Bh8#) if Black doesn't defend\n- Black can defend with ...Bf3, but then White can play Bh6 winning a pawn\n- Other bishop moves don't create immediate threats\n- King moves are too slow\n- a3a4 is good but not as forcing\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is f6h8, creating an immediate mating threat that Black must address, while also maintaining White's active piece play.\n\n```\nf6h8\n```"
