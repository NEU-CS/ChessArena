When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong centralized rook on e4 and bishop on d7 eyeing the kingside\n3. White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n4. Black's queen on d7 is very active, controlling key squares\n5. White has a passed pawn on c5 that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's rook on e4 is very strong, so we should consider moves that challenge it\n- The bishop on c5 is under attack by Black's pawn on e5\n- We have several ways to deal with the e5 pawn (capture with bishop, knight or pawn)\n- The move c5f8 looks tempting as it forks the queen and rook, but after ...Qxf8 we lose our strong bishop\n- The move g3g6 looks interesting to challenge Black's strong rook on e4\n\nAfter considering several candidate moves:\n1. c5f8 Qxf8 and we lose our strong bishop\n2. g3g6 Rxg6 and we trade our strong rook for theirs\n3. f3g5 looks interesting to challenge the e5 pawn and develop our knight\n4. d3g6 is a strong move that attacks the rook while developing our bishop\n\nThe best move appears to be d3g6:\n- It attacks the rook on e4\n- Develops our bishop to a strong diagonal\n- If Black takes with Rxg6, we can recapture with hxg6 and our pawn structure improves\n- If Black moves the rook, we maintain pressure\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats as effectively.\n\n```\nd3g6\n```"
