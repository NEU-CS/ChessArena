When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has two rooks and bishop vs Black's rook, bishop and pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White's rook on d7 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on f3 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's rook on c8 is eyeing the c-file\n- Black's pawn on f3 is threatening to promote\n- White needs to deal with the f3 pawn while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d7d8: Rook sacrifice to remove Black's rook, but after ...Rxd8 White's position remains complicated\n- e5e8: Rook sacrifice to expose Black's king, but after ...Kxe8 White's attack isn't decisive\n- e5f5: Blocking the f-pawn while maintaining pressure\n- g3h4: Bishop move attacking the f3 pawn\n- f1e1: King move to safety\n\n5. Best move seems to be e5f5:\n- Blocks the dangerous f3 pawn\n- Maintains control of the e-file\n- Keeps both rooks active\n- Doesn't allow Black any counterplay\n- After ...gxf5, White can play Rxd8+ winning the rook\n\nOther moves either don't address the f3 pawn or give up too much activity. e5f5 is the most forcing and principled move.\n\n```\ne5f5\n```"
