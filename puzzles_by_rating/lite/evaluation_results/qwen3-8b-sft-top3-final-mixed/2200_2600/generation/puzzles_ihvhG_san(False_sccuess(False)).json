When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a knight on d5 that's also very active\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n5. Black has a pawn on g3 that's threatening to promote soon\n6. White has a passed pawn on e4 that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on d5 is under attack by Black's pawn on e5\n- We need to deal with the threat of g3-g2-g1=Q\n- We should consider moves that either attack Black's pieces or defend our position\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d5e7 - Forking queen and rook, but after ...Qxe7 we lose material\n2. d5f6 - Attacking the rook, but Black can just take with ...gxf6\n3. f1f7 - Pinning the knight to the queen, but Black can play ...Qxf7\n4. d5c7 - Forking queen and rook, but after ...Qxc7 we lose material\n5. e2h5 - Developing the bishop with tempo on the rook\n\nAfter careful consideration, e2h5 seems best because:\n- It develops the bishop with tempo (attacking the rook)\n- It prepares to defend against g3-g2 threats\n- It maintains our active piece play\n- It doesn't allow Black any immediate counterplay\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the key threats. The bishop move is the most forcing and keeps the initiative.\n\n```\ne2h5\n```"
