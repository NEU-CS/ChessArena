When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This could be dangerous.\n- There is a **pawn on g3**, which is advanced and potentially weak.\n- Black has a **passed pawn on f6**, which could become dangerous if supported.\n- White has a **passed pawn on c5**, which is also a threat.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate some of the more promising options:\n\n### 1. `h4h8` \u2013 Rook to h8\n- This removes the rook from the pin on f2.\n- It also threatens to invade the back rank.\n- However, it gives up control of the h-file and allows White to play `Qxh8`.\n\n### 2. `h4h7` \u2013 Rook to h7\n- Keeps pressure on the 7th rank.\n- Supports possible ...g6 or ...g5 ideas.\n- Still under threat from `Qxh7`.\n\n### 3. `h4h6` \u2013 Rook to h6\n- Attacks the bishop on e3 via a discovered attack if the knight moves.\n- Also supports ...g5 or ...g6.\n- Seems like a strong candidate.\n\n### 4. `e7f8` \u2013 Knight to f8\n- Repositions the knight to a safer square.\n- Might support ...g6 or ...g5.\n- Not very aggressive.\n\n### 5. `f6g5` \u2013 Pawn to g5\n- Opens up the diagonal for the bishop on b2.\n- Could create tactical threats.\n- But weakens the kingside.\n\n### 6. `b2c3` \u2013 Bishop to c3\n- Develops the bishop to a more active square.\n- Eyes the rook on d1 (if it were still there).\n- Currently not much impact.\n\n### 7. `d7e5` \u2013 Knight to e5\n- A very active square for the knight.\n- Eyes f3 and g4.\n- Could lead to tactical ideas.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\n\nAfter evaluating all options, **`h4h6`** stands out as the most active and useful move.\n\n- It keeps the rook active.\n- It pressures the bishop on e3.\n- It supports future ...g5 or ...g6 breaks.\n- It avoids giving up the rook for nothing.\n\n---\n\n```\nh4h6\n```"
