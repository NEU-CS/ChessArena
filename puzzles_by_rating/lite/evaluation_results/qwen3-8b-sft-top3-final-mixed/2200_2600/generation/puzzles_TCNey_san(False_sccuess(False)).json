When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on h5, attacking f7 and g6\n- Black's queen is on g6, defending f7 but also eyeing white's king\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on f2\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h8: Queen sacrifice to remove black's queen, but after ...Kxh8 white's king remains exposed\n- h5g6: Trading queens, but this leads to a drawn pawn endgame\n- h5h7: Threatening mate on f7, but black can defend with ...Qxh7\n- b4b5: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn, but this seems too slow\n- f2e3: Moving the king to safety while attacking black's d4 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be f2e3 because:\n- It gets the king to safety\n- It attacks black's dangerous passed pawn on d4\n- It maintains all of white's active pieces\n- It prevents black from playing ...d3 which would create a very dangerous passed pawn\n\nOther moves either don't improve white's position or lead to complications that aren't clearly beneficial.\n\n```\nf2e3\n```"
