When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on c5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on b5\n- White's rook on h7 is very active\n- Black's rook on d8 is passive\n- Black's bishop on c4 is blocked by its own pawn on e5\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rh7-h5+ next move, forcing the black king to move\n- White's c-pawn could advance\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Rook lift to defend against Rh5+\n- g6g8: Rook moves to defend the 8th rank\n- c4e6: Bishop moves to open diagonal\n- b5c6: King moves to safety\n\nAfter considering these options, the most pressing issue is defending against Rh5+. The best way to do this is to activate the rook to h8, where it can both defend against the check and potentially attack the h7 rook.\n\nOther moves like king moves would leave the rook vulnerable, and bishop moves don't address the immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd8h8\n```"
