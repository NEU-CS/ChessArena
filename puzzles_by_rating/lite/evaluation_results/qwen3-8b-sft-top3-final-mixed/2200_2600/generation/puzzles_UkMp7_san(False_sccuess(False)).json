When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key threats:\n- White's e6 pawn is one square from queening\n- White's bishop controls the a2-g8 diagonal, limiting Black's king mobility\n- White's king is well placed to support the pawn\n\n3. Black's options:\n- The knight can block the pawn with c4d6, but after exd6, White gets a protected passed pawn\n- The knight can attack the bishop with c4e3, but after Bxe3 fxe3, White's pawns are still dangerous\n- The knight can try to fork with c4d2, but White can simply take with Kxd2\n- The king needs to get more active to stop the pawn\n\n4. Best defensive try:\n- Moving the king towards the center with g8f8 seems most logical\n- This prepares to bring the king to e7 to stop the pawn\n- Other king moves like g8h7 don't help as much\n- The knight moves don't stop the pawn's advance\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is to activate the king to stop the passed pawn:\n\n```\ng8f8\n```"
