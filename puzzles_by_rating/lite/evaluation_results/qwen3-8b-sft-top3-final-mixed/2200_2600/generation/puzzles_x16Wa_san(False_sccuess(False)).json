When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook + 3 pawns vs Black's Knight + 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on c5 is very active, controlling the c-file and 5th rank\n- Black's knight on d6 is well placed, defending the b5 and e5 squares\n- Black has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on c2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5c6: Attacks the b6 pawn and threatens to win material\n- c5e5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n- c5d5: Pins the knight to the king\n- b4b5: Advances the pawn but may be premature\n- c2d3: Improves king safety\n\n4. Evaluating c5e5:\n- Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n- After dxe5, White can play Rxe5, winning the pawn\n- Black can't recapture with the knight due to Nxe5 Rxe5+ winning the knight\n- This seems like the most forcing and advantageous move\n\n5. Other options:\n- c5c6 is interesting but after ...bxc6, Black gets counterplay with the b-pawn\n- c5d5 is less effective as the knight can just move away\n- Pawn moves don't address the immediate threats\n\nAfter careful consideration, capturing the passed pawn with the rook is the most principled move, eliminating Black's most dangerous asset while maintaining White's active piece play.\n\n```\nc5e5\n```"
