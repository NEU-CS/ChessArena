When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, pawn, and king vs Black's bishop, pawn, and king. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on f5\n- Black's king is exposed on c4\n- Black has a passed pawn on g4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on g2 that's close to promotion\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5f8: Rook to f8, threatening to check the black king\n- f5f7: Rook to f7, attacking the g7 pawn\n- f5f6: Rook to f6, controlling more space\n- e5e6: Pushing the e-pawn to create a passed pawn\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- f5f8 looks very strong as it immediately checks the black king (Kc4-d5 is forced)\n- After Kd5, White can play g2-g4, pushing the pawn with tempo against the bishop\n- The rook on f8 also prevents Black from advancing their g-pawn\n- Other moves don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate\n\n5. Potential lines:\n- f5f8 Kd5 g2g4 Bxg4 Rf5+ Ke4 Rf4+ Kd5 Rf5+ etc. leads to winning the bishop\n- Other moves give Black more chances to defend\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is f5f8, creating immediate threats against the black king while also preventing Black's counterplay.\n\n```\nf5f8\n```"
