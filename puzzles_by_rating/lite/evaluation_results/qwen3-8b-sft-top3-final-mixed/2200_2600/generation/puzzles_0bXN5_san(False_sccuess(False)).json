If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a king and a bishop, while Black has a king, a pawn on h4, and another pawn on g3 (which is about to promote). The key features:\n\n- **Black's pawns**: h4 and g3 are advanced and threatening to promote.\n- **White's king** is on e2, relatively centralized.\n- **White's bishop** is on g1, currently blocked by its own king from moving along the long diagonal.\n- **Black's king** is on h3, supporting the g3 pawn.\n\n### Goal for White:\nPrevent Black from promoting the g3 or h4 pawns. Ideally, try to capture one of them or force a stalemate/draw if promotion seems inevitable.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `e2f3`: Approaches the g3 pawn, possibly threatening to capture it.\n- `e2e3`: Centralizes the king slightly, supports potential action around the center.\n- `e2d3`, `e2d2`, `e2f1`, `e2e1`, `e2d1`: These are less active and don't help much in stopping the pawns.\n\n#### Bishop moves:\n- `g1a7`, `g1b6`, `g1c5`, `g1d4`, `g1e3`, `g1h2`, `g1f2`: Most of these are not useful unless they can control key squares near the pawns.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most immediate threat is the **g3 pawn**, which is one move away from queening. If Black plays `g3g2`, then `g2g1=Q` follows unless stopped.\n\nSo we must act quickly.\n\n#### Try: `e2f3`\n\nThis move brings the white king closer to the g3 pawn. It threatens to capture it next move (`Kxg3`) if Black doesn't defend properly.\n\nAfter `e2f3`, Black must respond carefully:\n- If Black plays `g3g2`, then White can play `Kxg2`, preventing promotion.\n- If Black tries to push `h4h3`, White can still respond with `Kf3-g3` and stop the pawn.\n\nThis move actively engages the king in the fight against the pawns and gives White the best chance to win or at least draw.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\ne2f3\n```"
