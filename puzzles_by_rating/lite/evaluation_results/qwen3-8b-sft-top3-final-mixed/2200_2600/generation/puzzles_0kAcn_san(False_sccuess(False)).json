When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized queen on h5 attacking f7 and h7\n3. Black's king is exposed in the center (e8) with limited pawn cover\n4. White has threats like Qxh7 or Qxf7+\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Qxh7, which would win material\n- The queen is also eyeing f7, which is only defended by the king\n- Black needs to address these threats while improving piece coordination\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h8g8 - Rook moves to defend h7, but allows Qxf7+ winning the bishop\n2. d8e7 - Queen blocks the f7 threat but leaves h7 vulnerable\n3. c5f8 - Bishop blocks the queen's diagonal to f7\n4. c8b7 - Developing the bishop while defending f7\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- c5f8 looks tempting but after Qxf8, Black loses material\n- c8b7 is solid, defending f7 and developing a piece\n- d8e7 is risky as after Qxf7+ Kxf7, White has Bxe6 winning material\n- h8g8 is the most forcing move, directly addressing the h7 threat\n\nThe best move appears to be h8g8, forcing White to either:\n- Take the rook (Qxg8) and then Black can play Qxf7+ winning the bishop\n- Or move the queen, allowing Black to consolidate\n\n```\nh8g8\n```"
