When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (rook vs bishop + 2 pawns).\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's c7 pawn is very advanced and threatening to promote\n- Black's bishop on c4 is very active\n- Black has connected passed pawns on f5 and g6\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8: Promoting the rook immediately, but after ...Bxc7 the pawn is lost\n- e7h7: Rook lift to attack the g6 pawn, but black can defend with ...Bf7\n- e7g7: Direct attack on g6 pawn, but black can play ...Bf7 defending\n- c7c8: Not legal (not in move list)\n- King moves: g1g2 looks safest, getting away from potential checks\n\n4. Best plan:\nThe c7 pawn is our most dangerous asset. We should push it to promote while preventing black from capturing it. The rook can support the pawn's advance.\n\nAfter e7e8 (promoting the rook), if black takes with Bxc7, we have Rxc7 and our rook will dominate. Black's pawns are not fast enough to promote.\n\nOther rook moves don't make progress. King moves are too passive.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to promote the rook:\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
