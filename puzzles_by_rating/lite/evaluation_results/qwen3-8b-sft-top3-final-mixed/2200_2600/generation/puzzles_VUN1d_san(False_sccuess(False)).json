When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black needs to either:\n- Defend carefully and look for counterplay,\n- Or find a way to activate pieces and create threats.\n\nThe most pressing issue is that the black king is somewhat exposed, and the white queen is threatening along the h-file.\n\n### Best Plan:\nWe should try to **activate the queen** and **connect the rooks** while keeping the king safe.\n\nLooking at the queen moves, **`d8g5`** stands out:\n- It attacks the white queen on h5.\n- It also eyes the weak f4 square.\n- It helps connect the rooks by potentially moving to g6 or f6 later.\n- It puts pressure on White\u2019s position.\n\nThis move forces White to respond defensively and gives Black initiative.\n\n---\n\n## Final Move:\n\n```\nd8g5\n```"
