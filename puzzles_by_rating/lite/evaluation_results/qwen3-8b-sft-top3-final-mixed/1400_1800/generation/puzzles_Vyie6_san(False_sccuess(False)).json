When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is very active on c4, threatening to capture the a4 pawn\n- Black's bishop on b4 is controlling important squares\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- Both sides have passed pawns (Black's a-pawn, White's h-pawn)\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: g8h8 (safe but passive), g8f8 (more active), g8g7 (centralizes)\n- Bishop moves: b4f8 (attacks h6 pawn), b4e7 (controls more squares)\n- Pawn moves: a4a3 (advances passed pawn), h7h5 (creates counterplay)\n\n4. Critical threats:\n- White can play Kxb4 next move if we don't defend the bishop\n- White's king is threatening to capture the a4 pawn\n\n5. Best options:\n- a4a3 seems tempting to push the passed pawn, but after Kxb4 axb4, White's king becomes too active\n- b4f8 is interesting as it attacks the h6 pawn, but White can still take the bishop\n- g8g7 centralizes the king and prepares to support the pawns\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to centralize the king while maintaining control over key squares. The move g8g7 prepares to support both the g and h pawns while keeping the bishop protected.\n\n```\ng8g7\n```"
