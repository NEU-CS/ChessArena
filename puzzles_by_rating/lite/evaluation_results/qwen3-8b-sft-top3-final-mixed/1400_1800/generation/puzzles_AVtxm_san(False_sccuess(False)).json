When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black has a strong bishop on c5 eyeing the white king position\n3. White's rook on d4 is very active but potentially trapped\n4. Black's queen on c7 is eyeing the d6 square and could create threats\n5. White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\nKey considerations:\n- The rook on d4 is under attack from the bishop on c5\n- We need to either save the rook or create counterplay\n- The pawn on e5 is passed but blockaded by Black's pawn on e6\n\nCandidate moves worth considering:\n1. d4d8 - trading rooks but leaving our bishop hanging\n2. d4d7 - attacking the queen but allowing Qxd7\n3. d4d6 - blocking the bishop's diagonal but allowing Qxd6\n4. f3g5 - developing the knight with tempo on the bishop\n5. e2e3 - reinforcing the d4 rook\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f3g5 looks tempting but after Bxg5, we lose material\n- e2e3 is solid but doesn't solve the rook issue\n- d4d7 is interesting as after Qxd7, we can play Qxd7 Rxd7 and our rook is safe\n- d4d6 is risky as after Qxd6, we lose the rook\n\nThe best move appears to be d4d7, forcing the queen trade and saving our rook. After Qxd7, we can recapture with Qxd7 and our rook is safe while we maintain material equality.\n\n```\nd4d7\n```"
