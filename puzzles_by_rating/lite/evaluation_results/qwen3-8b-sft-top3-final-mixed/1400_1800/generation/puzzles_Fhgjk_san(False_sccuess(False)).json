When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Rxb1  \n2. Qxb1 Nxe4  \n   - Now Black has a knight on e4, attacking the bishop on g3.\n   - White must move the bishop or lose it.\n   - After that, Black can continue developing or pressuring the center.\n\nThis looks like a good tactical sequence: **exchange rook for queen**, then **win a piece** with the knight.\n\nIs there any danger to Black in this line?\n\n- After `b2b1 Qxb1 Nxe4`, White cannot immediately counterattack.\n- Black gains a piece (bishop on g3) and removes White\u2019s queen from the board.\n- Black remains with a rook and knight for a queen \u2014 still up material.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe best move here is **`b2b1`**, initiating a tactical sequence that wins material for Black.\n\n```\nb2b1\n```"
