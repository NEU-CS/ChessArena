When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on g7, attacking the black king on b6\n- Black's queen is on d6, defending the b6 king\n- White has a rook on e8 that could potentially deliver checks\n- Black has a rook on a2 that's not very active\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is ...Qxg7, but after Qxg7 Rxg7, White is up a rook\n- White can also consider Qxb6+ winning the king, but after Kxb6, the position is simplified\n\n4. Best options:\n- Qxb6+ is tempting but leads to simplification\n- Rook moves like Re8-e6+ or Re8-e5+ look promising\n- Re8-e6+ forces the king to move (Kc7 or Ka7), then Qxb6 wins material\n- Re8-e5+ also looks strong, as after Kc7, Qxb6 is still winning\n\nAfter considering these options, Re8-e6+ seems most forcing and leads to a clear material advantage:\n\n1. Re8-e6+ Kc7 (if Ka7, then Qxb6 wins the queen)\n2. Qxb6+ Kd8 (only move)\n3. Qxa2+ wins the rook\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne8e6\n```"
