When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on h5 attacking g7\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen on e5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on f3 is pinned to the king by White's rook on c2\n\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Nxg7 winning a pawn\n- White could also play Qxg7+ winning the bishop\n- White's rook on c2 is very active\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 - moving the king away from potential checks\n- c8f8 - defending the f7 square\n- d7e6 - blocking the queen's diagonal\n- f3g4 - moving the pinned bishop\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- g8h8 seems passive and doesn't address the threats\n- c8f8 blocks the queen but allows Nxg7\n- d7e6 looks interesting as it blocks the queen and defends g7\n- f3g4 is forced due to the pin, but after Bxg4 Qxg4, Black's position remains difficult\n\nThe best move appears to be d7e6, as it:\n- Blocks the queen's diagonal\n- Defends the g7 pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White\n\n```\nd7e6\n```"
