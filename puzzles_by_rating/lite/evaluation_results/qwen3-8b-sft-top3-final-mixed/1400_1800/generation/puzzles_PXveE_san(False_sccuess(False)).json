When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a pawn (White has extra pawn on e6) but has active pieces. White's bishop on h7 is very strong, eyeing the black king.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8 with White's bishop pointing at it. White has threats like Qh5+ or Bxg7.\n\n3. Immediate threats: White has Qh5+ coming, which would be devastating. Black must address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8g8 - gets the king away from the bishop's diagonal\n- f8e8 - also moves king but less safe\n- c5e7 - blocks the bishop's diagonal but allows Qh5+ anyway\n- c5h5 - blocks the queen's path but loses the queen to Bxh5\n\n5. Best solution seems to be f8g8, moving the king to safety while keeping the rook connected. Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create worse problems.\n\nAfter f8g8, if White plays Qh5+, Black can respond with Kg7, and the position remains defensible.\n\n```\nf8g8\n```"
