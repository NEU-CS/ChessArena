When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has king + 2 pawns vs Black's king + 4 pawns. Black is up two pawns, but the position is very blocked.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is very active on g5\n- Black's king is stuck on c7\n- Both sides have passed pawns, but White's h-pawn is more advanced\n- Black has connected passed pawns on e4 and f5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h6: King moves towards Black's pawns, but allows ...f4 next\n- g5g6: King advances, but doesn't immediately threaten anything\n- g5f6: King attacks the e4 pawn, but after ...f4 White's king is forced back\n- g5f4: King captures the e4 pawn, but after ...f3 the position is unclear\n- Pawn moves: g2g3/f2f3/g2g4/f2f4\n\n4. Best plan:\n- White needs to activate the king while preventing Black's pawns from advancing\n- The most forcing move is g5f6, attacking the e4 pawn\n- After 1. Kf6 f4 2. Ke5 (to defend g4), White can try to create counterplay with the h-pawn\n\n5. Other options:\n- Pawn moves don't create immediate threats\n- g5h6 allows Black to push ...f4 with tempo\n- g5g6 is too passive\n\nAfter careful consideration, g5f6 is the most active move that creates immediate threats while maintaining king activity.\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
