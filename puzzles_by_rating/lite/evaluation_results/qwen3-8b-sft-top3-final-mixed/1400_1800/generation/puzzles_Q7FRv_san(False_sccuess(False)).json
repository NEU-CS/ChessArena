When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (rook, bishop, knight, queen vs rook, bishop, queen). Black has a slight space advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1 with limited pawn cover. Black's king is relatively safe on g8.\n\n3. Key features:\n   - White has a strong bishop pair (d3 and f4)\n   - Black's queen is very active on f6\n   - White's rook on e1 is controlling the e-file\n   - Black's knight on c6 is well-placed\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - f6h4: Threatening mate on h2, but White can defend with Qxh4\n   - f6f4: Exchanging queens, but this leads to a drawn bishop endgame\n   - e6g4: Attacking the f4 bishop, but White can play Bxg4\n   - c6e5: Centralizing the knight, but doesn't create immediate threats\n   - g7g6: Preparing to bring the king to g7, but too slow\n\n5. Best move appears to be f6h4, creating immediate threats:\n   - If White plays Qxh4, then g7g6+ wins the queen back (Kxg6 Qxg6+ Kh8 Qh7#)\n   - If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Qh2 or Qh6 with strong threats\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most forcing and dangerous move is:\n\n```\nf6h4\n```"
