When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: King, pawns on a6, b4, d7\n- Black has: King, rook on a1, pawn on f3\nMaterial is roughly equal (rook vs 3 pawns), but White's pawns are more advanced.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's d7 pawn is very dangerous and close to promotion\n- Black's king is somewhat active but needs to deal with the d7 pawn\n- Black's rook is currently passive on a1\n- White's king is well placed to support the pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: Need to stop the d7 pawn from promoting\n- Rook moves: Need to activate the rook to either attack pawns or create counterplay\n- f3f2: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn\n\n4. Best options:\n- e4d5: King moves toward the d7 pawn to stop its promotion\n- a1a6: Rook attacks the a6 pawn, forcing White to defend it\n- f3f2: Creates a passed pawn that could become dangerous\n\nAfter considering:\n- e4d5 is most urgent to stop the d7 pawn from promoting immediately\n- a1a6 is tempting but White can just push d7d8=Q\n- f3f2 is interesting but doesn't address the immediate threat\n\nThe most critical move is to bring the king closer to stop the d7 pawn:\n\n```\ne4d5\n```"
