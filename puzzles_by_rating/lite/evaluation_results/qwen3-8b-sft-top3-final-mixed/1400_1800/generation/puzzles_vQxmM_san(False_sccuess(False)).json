When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on g7 with White's rook on f1 and bishop on g2 eyeing it. White's king is safer on g1.\n\n3. Key threats: White has a strong passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h8: Moving the king to safety\n- f8f7: Protecting the king and connecting rooks\n- e7f7: Blocking the f-file and protecting the king\n- e6g5: Developing the bishop with tempo on the queen\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- g7h8 seems passive and allows White to push d4-d5\n- f8f7 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- e7f7 is better as it blocks the f-file and protects the king\n- e6g5 is tempting but after Qxg5, Black's position remains passive\n\nThe best move appears to be e7f7, which:\n1. Protects the king from potential checks\n2. Blocks the f-file preventing White's rook from becoming active\n3. Maintains coordination of Black's pieces\n4. Prepares potential counterplay with ...Rf8 later\n\n```\ne7f7\n```"
