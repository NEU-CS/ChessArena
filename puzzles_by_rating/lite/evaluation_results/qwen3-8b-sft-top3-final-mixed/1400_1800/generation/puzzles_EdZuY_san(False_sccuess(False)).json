When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on f6 attacking Black's queen\n- Black's queen is under attack and must move or be defended\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active\n- White's queen on f4 is eyeing the h6 square and could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: e7f8, e7e8, e7d7, e7c7, e7f6, e7d6, e7c5, e7b4, e7a3\n- Rook moves: d8g8, d8f8, d8e8, d8c8, d8b8, d8a8, d8d7, d8d6, d8d5\n- Other moves like bishop moves or pawn moves seem less critical\n\n4. Best options:\n- e7f6: Capturing the knight with the queen seems tempting, but after Qxf6, White can play Qxh6+ winning the h-pawn\n- e7e8: Moving the queen to safety while keeping pressure on f6\n- d8g8: Rook move that defends the queen while keeping it active\n\nAfter considering these, e7e8 seems most prudent:\n- It saves the queen from immediate danger\n- Maintains pressure on f6\n- Keeps the queen active on the back rank\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther queen moves either lose material or allow White to gain initiative. Rook moves like d8g8 are also good, but e7e8 is more direct and safe.\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
