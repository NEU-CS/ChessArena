When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop vs White's queen, knight, rook, pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on a6 is very active, eyeing the b7 pawn and potentially threatening mate on g6\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's bishop on e4 is strong, controlling important diagonals\n- White has a passed pawn on b5 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qg6+ next move, forcing the king to h8 and then potentially Rh1 with threats\n- White's rook on f2 is also eyeing the f-file\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: g8h8 looks safest, getting away from potential checks\n- Rook moves: c8f8 could be interesting to defend along the f-file\n- Bishop moves: e4g6 would block the Qg6+ threat but lose the bishop\n- Pawn moves: e6e5 could gain space but opens the position\n\nAfter considering these options, the most prudent move appears to be moving the king to h8, getting away from potential checks and reducing the immediate threats. Other moves either lose material or leave the king in danger.\n\n```\ng8h8\n```"
