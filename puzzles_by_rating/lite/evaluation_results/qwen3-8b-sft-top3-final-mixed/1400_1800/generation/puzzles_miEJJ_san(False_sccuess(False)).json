When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key threats:\n- White has a strong attack with Qe4 and Bg4 eyeing the f7 square\n- White's rook on c1 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Our priorities should be:\n- Defend against immediate threats\n- Try to activate our pieces\n- Look for any tactical resources\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 - moves king away from potential checks\n- a8f8 - connects rooks and defends f7\n- e4g6 - blocks the g-file and defends f7\n- d4d5 - gains space and opens lines for our pieces\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- g8h8 seems passive and doesn't address the threats\n- a8f8 is interesting but allows Qxf7+\n- e4g6 looks best as it blocks the g-file and defends f7, while maintaining our rook's activity\n\nThe move e4g6:\n- Blocks the g-file against potential Qg4+ ideas\n- Defends f7 from both Qe4 and Bg4\n- Maintains our rook's activity on the e-file\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new problems. While we're still in a difficult position, this seems like the most resilient move.\n\n```\ne4g6\n```"
