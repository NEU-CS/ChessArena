When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except White has an extra pawn)\n2. Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is a potential weakness\n3. White has a strong bishop pair and active pieces\n4. Black's queenside is undeveloped (a8 rook, d7 bishop)\n5. White has several promising options to exploit Black's position\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\n1. **b3b7** - This looks very tempting as it threatens to win the rook on a8. Black would have to respond with ...c6b7, but then we can play c4e6+ forking king and queen.\n\n2. **c4e6** - Immediate bishop sacrifice that looks promising. After ...dxe6, Qxe6+ Kf8, we have strong pressure with Bxe6+.\n\n3. **f4h6** - Bishop sacrifice that looks flashy but may not be as strong as other options.\n\n4. **b1c3** - Developing the knight but seems slow compared to more forcing options.\n\nAfter deeper analysis, **b3b7** seems the most forcing and promising:\n- If ...c6b7, then c4e6+ forks king and queen\n- If Black doesn't take, we can follow up with Qxa8 winning material\n- Black has no good way to defend against both threats\n\nThe immediate **c4e6** is also strong, but b3b7 seems more concrete and leads to immediate material gain or a strong initiative.\n\n```\nb3b7\n```"
