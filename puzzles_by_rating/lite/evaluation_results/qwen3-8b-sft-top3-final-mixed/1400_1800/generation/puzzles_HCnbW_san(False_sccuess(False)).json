When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n3. White has a strong rook on e5 and queen on f3 that could coordinate for an attack\n4. Black's bishop on e6 is very active, controlling key squares\n5. White's knight on b3 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) Rook moves:\n- e5e6 looks tempting, attacking the bishop and potentially opening lines\n- e5h5 could be interesting to swing the rook to the kingside\n- e5f5 might be too passive\n\nB) Queen moves:\n- f3f7 is a strong candidate, threatening mate on f7 and forcing Black to react\n- f3h5 could be interesting to bring the queen closer to the king\n- f3f5 might be too slow\n\nC) Knight moves:\n- b3c5 could develop the knight but doesn't create immediate threats\n- b3a5 is too passive\n\nD) Other moves:\n- g1h1 is safe but passive\n- c3c4 could be considered to gain space\n\nAfter considering these options, f3f7 seems the most forcing and dangerous move:\n1. It threatens Qxf7# which would be mate\n2. Black must respond by moving the king (Kh8) or blocking with the bishop (Bd7)\n3. After Kh8, White can follow up with Re8+ winning the bishop or continuing the attack\n4. If Bd7, then Qxd7+ wins the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. The f3f7 move puts maximum pressure on Black's position.\n\n```\nf3f7\n```"
