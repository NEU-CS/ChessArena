When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has bishop pair, Black has bishop+knight). \n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on h5 is very active, attacking f7 and e8\n- Black's queen on f6 is eyeing the f2 pawn\n- Black has a strong bishop on c5 pinning the knight on d2 to the king\n- White's king is somewhat exposed with the rook on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5e8: Bishop sacrifice, but after ...Qxe8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- h5f7: Bishop sacrifice, but after ...Qxf7 White's attack fizzles out\n- e2e5: Central push, but allows ...Bxe5 with complications\n- g1g8: Rook sacrifice, but after ...Kxg8 White's attack is unclear\n- d2f3: Breaking the pin, but allows ...Qxf3\n- e1d1: Getting out of the pin, but passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5g6:\n- Attacks the bishop on c5 which is pinning the knight\n- If ...Bxg6, then Qxg6 and White has strong threats against the exposed black king\n- If ...Qxg6, then Qxg6 and White has compensation\n- Maintains pressure while solving the pin issue\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or lead to unclear positions. h5g6 is the most forcing and maintains White's initiative.\n\n```\nh5g6\n```"
