When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (rook vs rook + 2 pawns, but white has a passed pawn).\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's d-pawn is very advanced and threatening to promote\n- Black's king is active but potentially exposed\n- Black's h-pawn is close to promotion but currently blocked by white's rook\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but can help support the d-pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6d7: Pushing the passed pawn is tempting, but after ...Rxd7, Kxd7, black can play ...Kf5 and the position is unclear\n- f6f8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, but black can play ...Rxf8 and the pawn race is still ongoing\n- b4c5: King moves toward the center, but doesn't immediately help the pawn\n- f6f5: Capturing the pawn, but after ...exf5, white's pawn is still blocked\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6f7:\n- Cuts off black's king from the d-pawn\n- Prepares to support the pawn's advance with Rf7-d7\n- If black takes with ...Rxf7, then Kxf7 and white's king can support the pawn\n- If black doesn't take, white can play Rf7-d7 next move\n\nOther moves either don't make progress or allow black counterplay. The rook lift to f7 is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nf6f7\n```"
