When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a knight on e4 that's very active\n- White's king is exposed on d3\n- Black's rook on e8 is controlling the e-file\n- White's rook on a1 is inactive\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Nf2+ winning the pawn on g2\n- Black could also play ...Rd8+ with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3f4: Blocks the knight but leaves king exposed\n- d3e5: Centralizes king but allows ...Nf2+\n- a1e1: Challenges the rook but allows ...Rxe1+\n- d3c5: Moves king away from threats but gives up central control\n\n5. Best move seems to be d3c5:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Prepares to activate the rook via c1\n- Prevents ...Nf2+ ideas\n- Keeps options open for both king and rook\n\nOther moves either leave the king exposed or give up too much control. d3c5 is the most solid choice that maintains White's position.\n\n```\nd3c5\n```"
