When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on h5 is very active, attacking the f7 pawn which is only defended by the king.\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover.\n- Black has a knight on e4 that's forking White's rook on e1 and bishop on b3.\n- White's knight on e5 is well placed but could be captured by Black's rook or bishop.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h8: Rook sacrifice to expose the king, but after ...Rxh8 White doesn't have immediate follow-up.\n- e5f7: Knight fork attacking king and rook, but Black can play ...Kxf7.\n- e1e4: Capturing the knight, but after ...Bxe4 White's position becomes messy.\n- h5h7: Threatening mate on g7, but Black can defend with ...Rg7.\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5f7:\n- It's a knight fork attacking both king and rook.\n- After ...Kxf7, White can play h5h7+ winning the rook on g7.\n- Even if Black tries ...Kg8, White has h5h7 threatening mate on g7.\n\nOther moves either don't capitalize on the initiative or allow Black to consolidate. The knight fork is the most forcing and disruptive move.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
