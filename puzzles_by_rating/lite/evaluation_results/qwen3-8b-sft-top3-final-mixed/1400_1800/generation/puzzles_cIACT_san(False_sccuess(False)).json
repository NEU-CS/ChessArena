When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, rook and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a strong bishop on b3 pointing at Black's kingside\n- Black's rook on d8 is active\n- White's rook on f1 is well placed to potentially attack the f-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b3e6: Bishop sacrifice to open up Black's king\n- f1f7: Rook sacrifice to expose the king\n- e2f4: Knight move attacking the bishop on c6\n- h3h4: Pawn push to gain space\n\n4. Deep analysis:\n- b3e6 looks tempting as it forces the king to take (Kxe6), then we can play f1f7+ winning the bishop back with a strong attack\n- After b3e6 Kxe6 f1f7+ Kf6 (only move), then f7xc7+ wins the bishop on c6\n- This leads to a favorable endgame with White's pieces more active\n\n5. Other options:\n- f1f7 immediately is met with Kxf7, and we don't have enough compensation\n- e2f4 allows Black to defend with Bxf4\n- h3h4 is too slow and doesn't create immediate threats\n\nThe bishop sacrifice b3e6 leads to a clear advantage after the sequence:\n1. b3e6 Kxe6\n2. f1f7+ Kf6\n3. f7xc7+ winning the bishop\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb3e6\n```"
