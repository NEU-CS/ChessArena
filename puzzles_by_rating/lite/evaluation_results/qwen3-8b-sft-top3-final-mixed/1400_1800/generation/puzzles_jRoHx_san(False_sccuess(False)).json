When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong rook on e6 and queen on f3 eyeing the f7 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's rooks are doubled on the e-file\n- Black's queen is active on c7\n\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxf7+ winning the pawn\n- White also has potential for a discovered attack with the rook on e6\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 - moves king away from potential checks\n- e8e7 - blocks the e-file and defends f7\n- c7e7 - queen blocks and defends f7\n- c7d6 - queen moves to a more active square\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- g8h8 is too passive and doesn't address the threats\n- e8e7 is solid but blocks the rook\n- c7e7 is the most precise, defending f7 while keeping the queen active\n- c7d6 is interesting but allows Qxf7+ anyway\n\nThe best move is c7e7, which:\n- Defends the f7 pawn\n- Keeps the queen active\n- Maintains coordination between rooks\n- Prevents any immediate tactics from White\n\n```\nc7e7\n```"
