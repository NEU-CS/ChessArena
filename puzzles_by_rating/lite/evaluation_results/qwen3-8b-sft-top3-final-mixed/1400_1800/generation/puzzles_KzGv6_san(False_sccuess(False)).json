When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. White has a strong passed pawn on h5 that could become dangerous\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n4. White's queen on g4 is very active and eyeing the g7 pawn\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated - the rooks aren't connected and the bishop on d6 is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n\nKey observations:\n- White threatens Qxg7 winning a pawn\n- Black needs to address this immediate threat\n- The knight on c4 is well placed but could be more active\n- The bishop on d6 is blocked and needs to find a better diagonal\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g7g6 - defends against Qxg7 but weakens dark squares\n2. f6g6 - blocks the queen's path to g7 but leaves the f6 pawn weak\n3. d6e7 - develops the bishop to a better diagonal while defending g7\n4. c4e5 - centralizes the knight and threatens to jump to f3\n\nAfter considering these options, d6e7 seems most promising because:\n- It develops the bishop to a better diagonal (a3-f8)\n- It maintains defense of g7\n- It keeps options open for the knight\n- It doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either create weaknesses (g7g6) or don't address the immediate threat (f6g6).\n\n```\nd6e7\n```"
