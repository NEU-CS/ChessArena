When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has knight, bishop, queen vs Black's rook, bishop, queen). However, White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on h4 is very active and threatening\n- White's knight on d5 is centralized and strong\n- Black's bishop on h3 is pinning White's f3 queen to the king\n- White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is Qxh2# if not addressed\n- White needs to deal with this while maintaining initiative\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3h5: Attacks the bishop and defends h2, but allows Qxh5\n- f3g4: Defends h2 but blocks the bishop's diagonal\n- d5e7: Forking queen and rook, but Black can play Qxh2#\n- f1e1: Blocking the pin and defending h2, but seems passive\n- d5f6: Attacks the queen while maintaining pressure\n\nAfter careful consideration, d5f6 seems strongest because:\n- It attacks Black's queen while maintaining pressure on e7\n- After Qxf6, White can play Qxh4 winning the queen\n- If Black moves the queen elsewhere, White maintains the initiative\n- It prevents Qxh2# while developing a tactical threat\n\nOther moves either don't address the threat or give up the initiative. The knight fork d5e7 is tempting but allows mate.\n\n```\nd5f6\n```"
