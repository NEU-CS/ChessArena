When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on c1\n- Black's queen on f7 is very active\n- Black's rook on d8 is semi-trapped\n- White has a passed pawn on b3 that could become dangerous\n- Black's knight on c4 is well placed\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qd3+ next move, forcing the king to move\n- White's rook on h1 could swing to h3 to attack the knight\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d8h8: Rook lift to h-file to attack the rook\n- f7g7: Queen moves to defend the rook\n- c4e3: Knight fork attacking queen and rook\n- c4d6: Knight moves to defend the rook\n\nAfter considering these options, c4e3 seems most promising because:\n- It creates an immediate threat to both the queen and rook\n- White would have to move the queen, allowing Black to capture the rook\n- Even if White finds a way to defend, Black gains time and initiative\n\nOther moves like d8h8 are tempting but don't create immediate threats. The knight fork is the most forcing move.\n\n```\nc4e3\n```"
