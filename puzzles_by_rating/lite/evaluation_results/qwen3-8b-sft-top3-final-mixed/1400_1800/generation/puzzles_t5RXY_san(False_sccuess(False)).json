When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key threats:\n- White has a strong attack with Qg5 threatening mate on g7\n- White's rook on b7 is very active and threatening the a8 rook\n- White's bishop on f6 is pinning the e7 bishop to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8f7: Blocking the queen's attack on g7, but allows Rxa8\n- e7f6: Capturing the bishop, but Qxf6 is crushing\n- a3a6: Moving the queen to safety while attacking the rook\n- a8e8: Moving the rook to defend the e7 bishop\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\nThe most urgent threat is Qg5-g7#. The only move that both defends against this and maintains material is f8f7, sacrificing the rook to block the queen's path to g7.\n\nAfter f8f7:\n- If Rxa8, then f7xg7 and Black has some counterplay with the queen\n- White might play Qg5xf6, but then f7xg7 and Black is still fighting\n\nOther moves either lose immediately or lose more material. While f8f7 is a rook sacrifice, it's the only way to continue resistance.\n\n```\nf8f7\n```"
