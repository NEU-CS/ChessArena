When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has a queen (Q), knight (N), and pawns\n   - Black has a queen (q), bishop (b), and pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen on f7 is attacking Black's rook on h8\n   - Black's king is exposed on c6\n   - White has a knight on e7 that's forking Black's king and queen\n   - Black's queen on e5 is under attack from White's pawn on e3\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - c6d7: King moves to d7, but then Qxe5 wins the queen\n   - c6c7: King moves to c7, but Qxe5 still wins the queen\n   - c6b7: King moves to b7, but Qxe5 wins the queen\n   - c6d6: King moves to d6, but Qxe5 wins the queen\n   - c6b6: King moves to b6, but Qxe5 wins the queen\n   - c6b5: King moves to b5, but Qxe5 wins the queen\n   - e5e7: Queen takes knight, but then Kxe7 and Black loses the queen\n\n4. The only move that doesn't immediately lose material is e5e7, sacrificing the queen to eliminate the knight fork. After:\n   - e5e7 Kxe7\n   - White can play Qxh8 winning the rook, but Black's king is safer than before\n\nAll other moves lose the queen immediately. While e5e7 is a queen sacrifice, it's the only way to avoid immediate material loss.\n\n```\ne5e7\n```"
