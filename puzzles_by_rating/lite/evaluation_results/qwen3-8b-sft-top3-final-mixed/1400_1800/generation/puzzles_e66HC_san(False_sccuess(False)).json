When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, queen, pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed d-pawn which is very dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's d6 pawn is passed and supported by c5 pawn\n- Black's queen on e5 is very active, eyeing the b2 pawn and potentially threatening mate ideas\n- Black's knight on e2 is forking White's rook on d1 and pawn on b2\n- White's rook on d1 is under attack by the knight\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d1d5: Blocking the queen's attack on b2 while attacking the queen\n- b4e4: Capturing the queen, but after ...Qxe4 White's position collapses\n- d6d7: Pushing the passed pawn, but Black can play ...Qxd7\n- b5b6: Creating another passed pawn, but not urgent\n- f1g1: Moving the rook away from potential knight forks\n\n4. Best move seems to be d1d5:\n- It blocks the queen's attack on b2\n- It attacks the queen, forcing it to move\n- After Qxd5, White can play cxd5 and the passed d-pawn becomes unstoppable\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. The pawn push d6d7 is tempting but premature as the pawn isn't yet protected.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\nd1d5\n```"
