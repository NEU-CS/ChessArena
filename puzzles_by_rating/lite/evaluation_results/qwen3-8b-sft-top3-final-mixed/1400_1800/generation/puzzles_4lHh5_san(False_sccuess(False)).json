When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on a8, but somewhat exposed\n- Black has a strong bishop pair and active pieces\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: a8c8 looks tempting to centralize the queen\n- Bishop moves: c1h6 threatens the f8 rook and pins it to the king\n- Knight moves: b1a3 develops the knight with tempo on the bishop\n- Pawn moves: d4e5 opens the position favorably for White's pieces\n\n4. Best options:\n- c1h6 is very strong as it:\n  - Attacks the rook on f8\n  - Pins the rook to the king\n  - Creates threats against the exposed king\n  - If Black takes with ...gxh6, White can play Qxh6+ winning the rook\n\nOther moves like a8c8 or d4e5 are good but not as immediately forcing as c1h6.\n\nAfter considering all options, the most forcing and advantageous move is:\n\n```\nc1h6\n```"
