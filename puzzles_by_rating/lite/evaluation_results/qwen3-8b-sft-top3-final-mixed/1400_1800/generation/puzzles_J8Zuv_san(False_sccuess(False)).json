When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n3. White has a strong knight on e5 that's very active\n4. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated with the queen on d7 and rook on c8\n5. White's bishop on g5 is pinning the f6 knight to the king\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on e5 is a monster and should be preserved\n- Black's king is vulnerable, so we should look for mating threats\n- The bishop on g5 is very strong and shouldn't be moved unless necessary\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5f7 - Forking queen and rook, but after ...Qxf7 we lose the knight\n2. e5g6 - Threatening mate on h8, but black can defend with ...Qxg6\n3. d3h7 - Queen move threatening mate, but black can defend with ...Qxh7\n4. g5h6 - Bishop move threatening mate, but black can play ...gxh6\n\nThe most promising seems to be e5g6, which threatens mate on h8. Black's best defense would be ...Qxg6, but then we can play Qxg6+ Kxg6 and our bishop on g5 remains strong, maintaining pressure.\n\nAfter e5g6 Qxg6, we have Qxg6+ Kxg6, and now:\n- Our bishop on g5 is still pinning the f6 knight\n- We can follow up with moves like Qxg6+ Kxg6, then Bxf6+ winning the queen\n- Or we can play Qxg6+ Kxg6, then Rh1+ with a strong attack\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous continuation.\n\n```\ne5g6\n```"
