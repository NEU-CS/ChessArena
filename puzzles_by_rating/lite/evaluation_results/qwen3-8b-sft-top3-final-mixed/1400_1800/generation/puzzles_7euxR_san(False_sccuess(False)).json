When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's queen on e5 is very active and eyeing the g3 pawn\n3. White's bishop on g4 is pinning the knight on f6 to the king\n4. Black has threats like ...Qxg3 or ...Qf4+ if we don't address them\n5. Our king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\nKey observations:\n- The pin on f6 is valuable but we need to be careful about our own king safety\n- We have several ways to defend against Qxg3:\n  * Bxf5 (but then exf5 opens the e-file)\n  * Qf3 (defends g3 but blocks the bishop)\n  * h4 (prevents Qxg3 but weakens the kingside)\n- The most forcing move is g4h5, attacking the queen while maintaining the pin\n\nAfter g4h5:\n- If Qxh5, then Bxf5 and we're up a pawn\n- If Q moves elsewhere, we maintain the pin and can consider castling queenside\n- This also prevents Qf4+ ideas\n\nOther candidate moves:\n- e3g5 looks tempting but allows Qxg5\n- d1d4 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- Castling (g1h1) is possible but premature with the queen so active\n\nThe most principled move is to challenge the queen while maintaining our positional advantages.\n\n```\ng4h5\n```"
