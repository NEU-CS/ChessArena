When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and 4 pawns vs White's bishop and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f6, while Black's king is relatively safe on g4.\n\n3. Key features:\n   - White's bishop on e1 is very active, controlling important squares.\n   - Black's knight on e3 is well-placed but needs to be careful about being trapped.\n   - White has a passed pawn on g5 that could become dangerous.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Knight moves: e3f5 looks tempting to attack the bishop, but after Bxf5 gxf5, White's king becomes more active.\n   - e3d5 could be interesting to centralize the knight, but it's not immediately threatening.\n   - e3g2 is a defensive move, protecting the h4 pawn and preparing to bring the knight to f4.\n   - Pawn moves: h5h4 could be useful to create a passed pawn, but it weakens the g4 square.\n\n5. Best move seems to be e3g2:\n   - Protects the h4 pawn which is currently under attack from White's g5 pawn\n   - Prepares to bring the knight to f4 via g2, where it would be very active\n   - Maintains flexibility for the knight\n   - Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or could lead to complications that aren't clearly beneficial.\n\n```\ne3g2\n```"
