When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Let's evaluate some of the legal moves:\n\n#### 1. `g4c8` \u2013 Queen takes rook!\n- This captures the white rook on c1 via a discovered attack from the black queen.\n- After `g4c8`, White cannot recapture with the rook because it would be pinned by the black queen to the king.\n- This is a **very strong move**: you win material cleanly.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- `g4c8` (Qxc8)\n- White can try `Qxb7` (queen takes knight), but then `Qxc1+` (queen checks king), and White must move the king.\n- Black gains a full rook for a knight \u2014 a clear material advantage.\n\nThis seems like the best move.\n\nOther moves like `g4g6`, `g4e6`, or `f7g8` are less effective and don't capitalize on the opportunity.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision:\n\nThe best move here is to capture the rook with the queen, gaining material advantage.\n\n```\ng4c8\n```"
