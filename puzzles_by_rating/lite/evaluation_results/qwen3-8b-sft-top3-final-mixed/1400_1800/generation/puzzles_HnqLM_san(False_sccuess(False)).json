When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, pawn on c6, pawns on g3/f3/h2/a2. Black has a bishop, queen, pawns on g6/h6/f7. Material is roughly equal but White has a passed pawn on c6.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's c6 pawn is very dangerous and close to promotion\n- Black's queen is active on c3, eyeing the c6 pawn\n- Black's bishop on e5 is controlling important squares\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6c7: Pushing the passed pawn immediately, but after ...Qxc7 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- f2a7: Queen sacrifice to eliminate the bishop, but after ...Qxa7 White's c-pawn is gone\n- f2b6: Attacking the bishop while keeping pressure on c6\n- a5b7: Knight move attacking the f7 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be f2b6:\n- Attacks the bishop on e5\n- Maintains pressure on the c6 pawn\n- If Black takes the knight with ...Bxb6, then c6c7 is very strong\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can consider Qxe5 or continue pushing c6c7\n- Keeps all options open while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the c-pawn or give up too much material. f2b6 is the most flexible and maintains White's advantage.\n\n```\nf2b6\n```"
