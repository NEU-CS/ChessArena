When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on f5 that could become dangerous\n- White's king is exposed and needs to find safety\n- Black's rook on e3 is very active\n- White's rook on e7 is currently passive\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: g1h2 or g1f2 to get away from potential checks\n- Rook moves: e7e8 to trade rooks (but after ...Rxe8 Bxe8, Black's knight becomes active)\n- Bishop moves: d5g8 to pin the pawn to the king (but Black can play ...fxg8=Q)\n- Pawn moves: e4e5 to block the f-pawn's advance\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4e5:\n- Blocks the dangerous passed pawn\n- Opens the d-file for the rook\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- King moves leave the rook undefended\n- Rook trades give Black active pieces\n- Bishop moves allow Black to promote the pawn\n\nAfter e4e5, if Black takes with fxe5, White can play Rxe5 with a favorable position.\n\n```\ne4e5\n```"
