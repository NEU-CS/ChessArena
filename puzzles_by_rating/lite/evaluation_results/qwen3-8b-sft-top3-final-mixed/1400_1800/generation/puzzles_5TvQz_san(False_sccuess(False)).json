When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on a6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's rook on h4 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's king is on b3, Black's king on d1\n- White's rook on e6 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Re6-e1+ next move, forcing Black's king to move and potentially winning the d3 pawn\n- White's a-pawn is close to promotion (a6-a7-a8)\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h4h6: Attacks the h-pawn but allows Re1+\n- h4g4: Keeps rook active but doesn't address threats\n- d3d2: Pushes the pawn but allows Re1+ winning it\n- d1d2: King moves to defend pawn but allows Re1+ winning the pawn\n- h4e4: Blocks the e-file and defends d3 pawn\n\nAfter considering these, h4e4 seems best because:\n- It blocks the e-file preventing Re1+\n- It maintains control of the d3 pawn\n- It keeps the rook active\n- It prevents White from playing Re6-e1+ immediately\n\nOther moves either allow White to win the d3 pawn or don't address the immediate threats.\n\n```\nh4e4\n```"
