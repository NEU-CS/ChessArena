When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong attack with queen and rook battery on the g-file\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White's bishop on e4 is very strong, controlling key squares\n5. Black's queen on d2 is under attack by White's rook on g3\n\nKey observations:\n- White is threatening Qxg7# if Black doesn't defend\n- Black's rook on e8 is pinned to the king by White's bishop\n- Black's queen must move to avoid immediate mate\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d2g5 - blocks the g-file but allows Qxg5\n2. d2d5 - moves queen away but still leaves mate threats\n3. d2e1 - gets queen to safety but allows Qxg7#\n4. e8e7 - unpins rook but allows Qxg7#\n5. g8f8 - moves king away but allows Qxg7#\n\nAfter careful consideration, the only move that prevents immediate mate is to block the g-file with the queen while maintaining some defensive resources:\n\n```\nd2g5\n```\n\nThis at least prevents Qxg7# and maintains some coordination between pieces, though Black remains in a very difficult position. All other moves lead to immediate mate or massive material loss."
