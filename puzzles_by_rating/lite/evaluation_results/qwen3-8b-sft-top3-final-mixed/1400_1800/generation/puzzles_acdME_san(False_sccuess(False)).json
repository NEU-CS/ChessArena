When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized queen on e4 and rook on e5\n3. Black's queen on a2 is under attack by White's bishop on c3\n4. Black's king is exposed with White's rook on e5 eyeing the e-file\n5. Black's knight on c6 is pinned to the king by White's queen\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is that White can play Qxc6 winning the knight\n- Black needs to address this pin while trying to create counterplay\n- Moving the queen to safety is critical\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. a2b1 - Queen retreats to safety but blocks the rook\n2. a2a1 - Queen retreats but seems passive\n3. c6d4 - Knight moves but still leaves queen hanging\n4. f8e8 - Rook moves to defend e-file but doesn't solve queen issue\n\nBest option seems to be a2b1:\n- Gets the queen to safety\n- Maintains some coordination between queen and rook\n- Keeps options to bring the rook into play via b8 later\n- Prevents immediate material loss\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen's safety or leave the knight pinned. While a2b1 isn't perfect, it's the most resilient option in this difficult position.\n\n```\na2b1\n```"
