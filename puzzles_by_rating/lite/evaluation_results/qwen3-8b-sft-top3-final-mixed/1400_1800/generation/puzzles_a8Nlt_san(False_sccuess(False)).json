When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Queen (b6), Rook (g6), pawns (c5, h5)\n   - Black has: Knight (c6), pawns (b7, d5), Rook (a3), King (e6)\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active\n\n2. Key threats/observations:\n   - White's queen and rook are very active and coordinating\n   - Black's king is exposed in the center\n   - White has a passed pawn on c5 that could become dangerous\n   - Black's rook on a3 is passive and needs activation\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n   - e6f7: King moves towards corner, but allows Qg6+ winning the knight\n   - e6e7: King moves up, but Qg6+ still wins knight\n   - e6d7: King moves towards queenside, but Qg6+ wins knight\n   - e6f5: King moves forward, but Qg6+ wins knight\n   - e6e5: King moves forward, but Qg6+ wins knight\n   - d4f6: Knight moves, blocking the queen's path to g6\n\n4. The only move that prevents immediate loss of material is d4f6, blocking the queen's path to g6. After d4f6:\n   - If Qxf6, then Kxf6 and Black's king is safer\n   - White might play Qb6+ instead, but then Kf7 and Black survives\n\nAll other king moves allow Qg6+ winning the knight immediately. Therefore, d4f6 is the only move that maintains material balance.\n\n```\nd4f6\n```"
