When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n3. Black's rooks are not well coordinated\n4. White has a passed e5 pawn that could become dangerous\n5. Black's knight on c6 is under attack by the bishop\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c6d8 - Retreating the knight to safety while connecting rooks\n2. c8e6 - Blocking the bishop's diagonal and defending the knight\n3. g8h8 - Moving the king to safety\n4. e8e7 - Moving the rook to defend the king\n\nAfter considering these:\n- c6d8 looks passive but safe\n- c8e6 blocks the bishop but leaves the knight hanging after Bxe6\n- g8h8 is tempting but after Qf5+ Kh7 Qh5+ Kg7 Qh6+ Kg8 Qh5+ we're in a perpetual\n- e8e7 is solid, defending the king and preparing to double rooks\n\nThe best move appears to be e8e7, as it:\n1. Defends the king\n2. Prepares to double rooks on the e-file\n3. Maintains flexibility\n4. Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
