When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on b6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on c8\n- White's queen on e2 is eyeing the h5 pawn\n- Black's rook on h8 is under attack from White's rook on a6\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Ra8+ next move, winning the rook\n- White could also push b7, promoting the pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 - moves the rook away from attack but doesn't address the b-pawn\n- c8d8 - king moves away from potential checks\n- f6g7 - blocks the queen's diagonal to h5\n- g6g7 - defends the h5 pawn\n\nAfter considering these options, the most pressing issue is the b-pawn. If we don't stop it, White will play b7 and promote. The best way to stop this is to bring the king closer to help stop the pawn.\n\nTherefore, moving the king to d8 is the most logical choice, as it:\n- Gets the king closer to the b-pawn\n- Avoids potential checks from the rook\n- Maintains control of the position\n\nThe move is:\n\n```\nc8d8\n```"
