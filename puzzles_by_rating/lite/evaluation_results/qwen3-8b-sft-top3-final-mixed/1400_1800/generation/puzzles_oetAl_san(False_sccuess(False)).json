When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black has a strong centralized queen on d5 and bishop on c7\n3. White's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n4. Black's king is exposed on g8 with weak dark squares around it\n5. White has potential to create threats against Black's king\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's queen on d5 is very active and needs to be challenged\n- White's knight on f3 is well placed to jump into aggressive squares\n- The bishop on e3 is blocked by its own pawn on d3\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f3g5 - Attacks the queen and threatens to fork with Nf7+\n2. e3g5 - Also attacks the queen but less forcing\n3. f2g4 - Prepares to bring the knight to f6 with tempo against the queen\n4. a1e1 - Centralizes the rook but doesn't create immediate threats\n\nAfter considering these:\n- f3g5 looks most promising as it immediately challenges Black's most active piece\n- After Qxg5, Nxg5 opens the g-file for White's rook\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White gains time and initiative\n\nOther moves like e3g5 are less forcing, and f2g4 is more positional but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
