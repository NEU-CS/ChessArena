Material count:\n- White has: Rook (d3), Rook (h1), pawns (a2, b3, e4, h5)\n- Black has: Rook (f7), Bishop (d4), pawns (a3, c5, d6, e6)\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has 4 pawns vs Black's 4 pawns + bishop)\n\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on f3\n- Black king is relatively safe on e5\n- Black's bishop on d4 is very active and controls key squares\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's rook on f7 is eyeing the f-file\n- Black's bishop on d4 is attacking the e4 pawn\n- Black could play ...Rf3+ next move if we don't address it\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f3g4: Moves king towards center but into bishop's diagonal\n- f3g3: Keeps king safer but still leaves f-file open\n- f3g2: Moves king towards corner but away from action\n- f3e2: Best option - moves king to safer square while blocking bishop's diagonal\n\n5. Best move:\nf3e2 is the most prudent choice because:\n- It moves the king to a safer square\n- It blocks the bishop's diagonal to e4\n- It maintains control over f3 to prevent ...Rf3+\n- It keeps options open for future rook coordination\n\nThe other moves either expose the king more or don't address the immediate threats.\n\n```\nf3e2\n```"

Let's evaluate both:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `e2e1` (King to e1)\n\n- Keeps the king centralized.\n- Still allows Black to play `f2f1=Q+`, promoting with check.\n- After `f2f1=Q+`, White can respond with `Ke1d2` or `Ke1e2`, but Black will have a queen and a strong position.\n\nThis move does not stop the promotion and gives Black a decisive advantage.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `e2d1` (King to d1)\n\n- King steps off the diagonal of the black bishop (d4).\n- Still allows `f2f1=Q+`, but now White can respond with `Kd1c2` or `Kd1e2`.\n- More flexibility in dealing with the new queen.\n- Slightly better than `e2e1`.\n\nStill, this move does not prevent the promotion.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBoth moves allow Black to promote the pawn with check. However, `e2d1` gives White slightly more flexibility in responding to the new queen and may offer better chances to resist or even counterattack.\n\nThus, the best move is:\n\n```\ne2d1\n```"
