When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Bishop, Pawn vs Black's Rook, Bishop, Pawn. Material is equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on f6 is very active, attacking the black king on c5\n- Black's rook on h1 is threatening to capture the h3 pawn\n- Black's bishop on f2 is pinning the h3 pawn to the king\n- White's bishop on d3 is blocked by its own pawn on c3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6f8: Rook checks the king, but after Kd6 it doesn't achieve much\n- f6f7: Rook attacks the g7 pawn, but black can defend with ...Rh8\n- f6h6: Rook attacks the h5 pawn, but black can play ...Rxh6\n- f3g4: Bishop moves, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d3h7: Bishop sacrifices itself to remove the pin on h3\n\n4. The most critical issue is the pin on h3. If we don't address it, black can play ...Rxh3 next move. The best way to break the pin is:\n- d3h7: Bishop sacrifice to remove the pin. After Bxh7, Kxh7, we can play Rxh5 winning a pawn and keeping the initiative.\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or allow black to maintain pressure. The bishop sacrifice is the most forcing way to improve our position.\n\n```\nd3h7\n```"
