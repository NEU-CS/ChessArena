When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on c5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White's knight on f3 is well placed, eyeing e5 and g5 squares\n- Black's bishop on c7 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rd1 next, activating the rook\n- White might try to push the c-pawn or bring the knight to e5\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: g8h8 or g8f8 to get away from potential checks\n- Rook moves: a8f8 to challenge White's active rook\n- Bishop moves: c7d6 to develop the bishop\n- Pawn moves: e6e5 to challenge White's knight\n\nAfter considering these options, the most pressing concern is king safety. Moving the king to h8 (g8h8) seems best because:\n- It gets the king away from the g-file where White's rook could potentially check\n- It maintains flexibility for future moves\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Other king moves either leave it exposed or block pieces\n\nThe other options have drawbacks:\n- Rook moves allow White to activate their rook\n- Bishop moves don't address the immediate king safety issue\n- Pawn moves could create weaknesses\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng8h8\n```"
