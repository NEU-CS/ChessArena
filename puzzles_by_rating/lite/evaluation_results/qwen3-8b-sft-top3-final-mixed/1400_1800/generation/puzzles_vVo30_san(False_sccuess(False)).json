When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has king + knight + 3 pawns vs Black's king + knight + 3 pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is more active (b3 vs black's e5)\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n- Black has a passed pawn on a3\n- Black's knight is more active on f6\n- White's knight is somewhat restricted on g3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3h5: Attacks the f6 knight, but after ...Nxh5, white's pawn structure is damaged\n- g3e2: Centralizes the knight but doesn't create immediate threats\n- b3a4: Captures the a3 pawn but allows ...Nxd5 winning a pawn\n- c4c5: Advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n- b3c3: Prepares to support the c-pawn's advance\n\n4. Best move considerations:\n- b3a4 seems tempting to win the a3 pawn, but after ...Nxd5, black gets a strong knight in the center\n- c4c5 is interesting but may be met with ...Kd5 challenging the pawn\n- g3h5 is the most active, forcing the knight trade and simplifying the position\n\nAfter careful consideration, g3h5 is the most principled move:\n- It forces the knight trade, reducing black's active pieces\n- After Nxh5, white can play Kxa3, eliminating black's passed pawn\n- The resulting position should be winning for white with active king and passed pawns\n\n```\ng3h5\n```"
