When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has King, Rook, and passed pawn on g7\n- Black has King, Bishop, and pawns on a6 and b5\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's g-pawn is very dangerous and close to promotion\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- Black's bishop is currently blocked by its own pawn on b5\n- White's rook controls the 2nd rank, preventing Black's king from moving to b3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: Need to activate the bishop while keeping an eye on the g-pawn\n- King moves: Need to get closer to the g-pawn to stop it\n- Pawn moves: a6-a5 or b5-b4 to create counterplay\n\n4. Evaluating bishop moves:\n- c8d7 blocks the bishop's diagonal and doesn't help\n- c8b7 is similar\n- c8e6 is interesting as it eyes the g-pawn while staying active\n- c8f5/g4/h3 are too far from the action\n\n5. Evaluating king moves:\n- b2b3 is illegal due to rook control\n- b2a3/a2/c1 all leave the king passive\n\n6. Evaluating pawn moves:\n- a6a5 creates a passed pawn but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- b5b4 is more promising as it opens the bishop's diagonal and creates a passed pawn\n\nAfter considering all options, b5b4 seems best because:\n- It opens the bishop's diagonal to attack the g-pawn\n- Creates a passed pawn on b4\n- Maintains flexibility for the king\n- The bishop can then move to e6 or f5 to target the g-pawn\n\n```\nb5b4\n```"
