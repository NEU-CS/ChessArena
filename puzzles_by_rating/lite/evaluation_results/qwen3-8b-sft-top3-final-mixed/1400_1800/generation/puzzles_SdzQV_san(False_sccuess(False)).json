When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, queen, rook, and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on f5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's queen on f6 is defending the g7 square\n- White has a passed pawn on h5 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5g7: Forking queen and rook, but after ...Qxg7 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- f5e7: Attacking the bishop, but Black can defend with ...Qxe7\n- f5h6: Threatening mate on g8, but Black can play ...Qxh6\n- e4a8: Bishop sacrifice, but after ...Rxa8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- f3g4: Developing the queen with tempo on the bishop\n\n4. Best move appears to be f5h6:\n- Creates an immediate threat of Qxg7# next move\n- Black must respond with ...Qxh6, after which:\n  - White can play Qxh6, winning the queen for a knight\n  - Even if Black tries ...Rxh6, White has Bxh6 with a strong attack\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. The knight sacrifice on h6 is the most forcing and dangerous continuation.\n\n```\nf5h6\n```"
