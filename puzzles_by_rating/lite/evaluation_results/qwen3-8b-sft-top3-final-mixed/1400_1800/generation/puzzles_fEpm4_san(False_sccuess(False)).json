When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d3, eyeing the b1-h7 diagonal\n- Black's queen on b2 is also active, but potentially trapped\n- Black's rook on h8 is passive\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on b6\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxb2 winning the queen\n- White could also play Qd5+ with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b4: Gets the queen to safety while attacking the rook\n- b2f2: Checks the king and forces it to move\n- h8g8: Activates the rook\n- b6b7: Moves the king away from potential checks\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- b2b4 looks tempting but after Qxb4, Black loses material\n- b2f2+ is interesting: Kg1-h1 (only move), then we can play Rh8-h1#\n- h8g8 is solid but doesn't address the queen safety\n- b6b7 is too passive\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is b2f2+, which leads to immediate checkmate after Kg1-h1 Rh8-h1#.\n\n```\nb2f2\n```"
