When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized knight on c4 and active pieces\n3. Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous\n4. White has threats like Qd2-d5+ or Bf3-g4+\n5. Black's queen on g4 is exposed and could be a target\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the king safety issue\n- Need to deal with the threats against the queen\n- Need to activate Black's pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e8g8 (castling) - gets the king to safety but leaves the queen hanging\n2. g4h5 - moves the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n3. e7f6 - develops the bishop and protects the queen\n4. f4h6 - moves the queen to safety while attacking the knight\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g4h5 seems best as it saves the queen while keeping pressure on White's position\n- e8g8 is tempting but after Qd5+ we'd have to move the king again\n- Other queen moves either don't address the threats or lose material\n\nThe move g4h5 also prepares potential ...h7-h5 to kick the knight, and keeps options open for Black's pieces.\n\n```\ng4h5\n```"
