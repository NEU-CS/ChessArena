When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong centralized queen on d4 and active bishop on g3\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- Black's rook on c8 is blocked by the bishop on c6\n- White has threats against the black king (e.g. Qd4-f6+)\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Qd4-f6+ winning the rook on h8\n- White could also play Qd4xc6 winning the bishop\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 - gets the rook out of danger but allows Qxf6+\n- e8g8 - castles but leaves the rook on h8 hanging\n- f6d8 - blocks the queen's path to f6 but allows Qxc6\n- c6d7 - moves the bishop but allows Qxf6+\n- e4g5 - blocks the queen's path to f6 while developing the knight\n\nAfter careful consideration, e4g5 seems best because:\n- It blocks the dangerous queen path to f6\n- Develops the knight to a more active square\n- Maintains material equality\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n- Prepares potential future ...g6 to challenge the bishop\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the king too exposed.\n\n```\ne4g5\n```"
