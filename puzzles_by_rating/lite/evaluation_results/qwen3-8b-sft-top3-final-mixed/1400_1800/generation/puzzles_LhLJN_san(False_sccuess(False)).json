When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's rook on g3 is very active but potentially vulnerable\n4. Black's knight on b6 is well-placed, controlling key squares\n5. White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\nKey considerations:\n- The rook on g3 is under attack from the bishop on f5\n- We need to either move the rook or defend it\n- Moving the rook to g7 looks tempting to attack the rook on d8, but after ...Rd7 it's not clear\n- Moving the rook to g6 defends the pawn on g6 but blocks our own pawn\n- Moving the rook to g5 seems best - it maintains activity while getting out of attack\n- Other rook moves like g4 or h3 are less active\n- The bishop moves don't seem as urgent as rook safety\n\nAfter g3g5, we maintain pressure on the 5th rank and keep our rook active. Black's best reply would likely be ...Bxg5, but then we can recapture with hxg5, opening the h-file for our rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move appears to be:\n\n```\ng3g5\n```"
