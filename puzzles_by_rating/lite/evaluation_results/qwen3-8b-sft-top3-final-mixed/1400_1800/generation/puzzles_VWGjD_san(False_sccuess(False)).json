When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and queen vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on f7 is attacking Black's rook on g8\n- White's rook on e5 is very active and could potentially check the king\n- White's pawn on c5 is passed and dangerous\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with White's queen and rook eyeing it\n- White's king is relatively safe on h2\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Moving the rook away from attack: g8f8 or g8e8\n- Counterattacking with the queen: h4f2 (threatening mate on h2)\n- Defending with the bishop: b5e8 (blocking queen's attack on rook)\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- g8f8 allows Qxf8 winning the rook\n- g8e8 allows Qxe8 winning the rook\n- h4f2 is tempting but after Qxf2+ Kxf2, Black loses material\n- b5e8 seems best as it defends the rook while developing the bishop\n\nThe move b5e8:\n- Blocks the queen's attack on the rook\n- Develops the bishop to a more active square\n- Maintains material equality\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb5e8\n```"
