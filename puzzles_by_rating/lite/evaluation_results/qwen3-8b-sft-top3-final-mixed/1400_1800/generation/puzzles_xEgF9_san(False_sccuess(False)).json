When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook, rook, queen vs White's rook, knight, queen. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on c3 and queen on g3 eyeing the g7 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's rooks are not well coordinated\n- White's rook on e3 is very active\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg7+ winning a pawn\n- White could also play Rxe8+ winning a rook\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 - moves king away from potential checks but doesn't solve other problems\n- e8e7 - blocks the e-file and connects rooks\n- f6g6 - defends g7 pawn but blocks the rook\n- f6e7 - centralizes queen and defends g7\n\nAfter considering these options, e8e7 seems most prudent because:\n- It blocks the e-file preventing Rxe8+\n- It connects the rooks which is generally good\n- It maintains defense of g7 pawn\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new problems. For example, moving the queen would leave g7 undefended, and king moves don't solve the material threats.\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
