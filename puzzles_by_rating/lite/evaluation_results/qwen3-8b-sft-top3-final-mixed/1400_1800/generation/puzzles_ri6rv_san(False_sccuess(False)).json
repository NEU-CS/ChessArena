When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous\n4. White has pressure on the e-file with rook on e1 and queen on d1\n5. Black's bishop on b4 is very active, pinning the c3 pawn to the king\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the king safety issue\n- Need to deal with the pin on c3\n- Need to activate the rook on h8\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e8g8 - Castling looks tempting but the king would still be exposed after castling\n2. e8f8 - Moving the king away from the e-file\n3. b4c3 - Capturing the pawn to break the pin\n4. h8g8 - Rook lift to activate the rook\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- b4c3 seems most forcing as it breaks the pin and wins a pawn\n- After bxc3, bxc3, Black can play ...Qd7-c7 attacking the rook on e1\n- The pawn on c3 would be weak but Black gets active play\n- Other moves either don't address the pin or leave the king exposed\n\nThe most concrete and active move is to take the pawn and activate the queen:\n\n```\nb4c3\n```"
