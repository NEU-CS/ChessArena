When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b5 is very active, eyeing the f1 square\n- Black's queen on f2 is extremely powerful, controlling key squares\n- Black's bishop on c2 is pinning White's pawn on d2 to the king\n- White's king is exposed on c1\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxf2+ winning the queen\n- White could also play Qb1+ winning the bishop\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f2f1: Queen sacrifice to eliminate White's rook and expose the king\n- c2b1: Bishop sacrifice to eliminate White's rook\n- f2g1: Queen move to maintain control\n- h8g8: King move to safety\n\nAfter careful consideration, f2f1 is the most forcing and strongest move:\n- It sacrifices the queen but wins back material with interest\n- After Kxf1, Black can play Bxd2+ winning the rook\n- White's king will be very exposed after this sequence\n- Black maintains strong attacking chances\n\nThe move is:\n```\nf2f1\n```"
