When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Rook, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, Rook, Knight, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very strong, attacking f7 and supported by the rook on d5\n- Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's rook on g6 is under attack by White's pawn on f4\n- White has a passed pawn on b4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e8f8: King moves to f8, getting away from potential checks but still exposed\n- g6e6: Rook takes the queen, but after Qxe6+ Kxe6, White has Rxe6+ winning material\n- b6e6: Queen takes the rook, but after Rxe6+ Kxe6, White has Qxe6+ winning material\n\n4. Best defensive option:\nAll moves lead to material loss, but e8f8 at least keeps the king safer from immediate checks. The other moves lose material immediately.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the least bad option is to move the king to f8:\n\n```\ne8f8\n```"
