When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (king + pawns). White has pawns on a3, b4, e4, f5, g4, h5. Black has pawns on a7, b5, e5, f6, g5, h6.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b2, while Black's king is more active on a4.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - White has a passed pawn on b4, but it's blockaded by Black's king.\n   - Black has a passed pawn on e5, but it's blockaded by White's e4 pawn.\n   - The kingside pawns are locked (g4 vs g5, h5 vs h6).\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - b2c3: Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks from Black's king.\n   - b2c2: Keeps king protected but doesn't make progress.\n   - b2a2: Moves king away from center, not ideal.\n   - b2c1/b2b1/b2a1: Retreating the king seems passive.\n   - f5f6: Advances the pawn, but after ...gxf6, White's pawn structure becomes weak.\n\nThe best move appears to be b2c3, centralizing the king and preparing to support the b-pawn's advance. While it exposes the king slightly, it's the most active option that maintains control of key squares.\n\n```\nb2c3\n```"
