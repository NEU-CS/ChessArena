When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h6 is very active, attacking f8 and g7\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has a bishop on f3 controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on d6 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h7: Queen check, but after Kh8-g8 it's not clear what's next\n- h6g7: Queen takes rook, but after Bxg7 White loses the queen for rook\n- d6d7: Pushing the passed pawn, but Black can stop it with Qd8\n- d1d5: Centralizing the rook, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- h6f6: Queen check, forcing the king to move\n\n4. Best move seems to be h6f6+:\n- Forces the black king to move (only to g8)\n- Then we can play Qxf8, winning the exchange (queen for rook)\n- After Qxf8 Rxf8, we have Rxf8+ Kxf8, and our passed d-pawn becomes very strong\n- Black's bishop on f3 is also hanging after this sequence\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. The queen check is the most forcing and leads to material gain.\n\n```\nh6f6\n```"
