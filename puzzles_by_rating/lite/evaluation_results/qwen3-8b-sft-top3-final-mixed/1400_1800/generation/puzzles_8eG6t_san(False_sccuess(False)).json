When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on g4.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's rook on d7 is very active\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on d4\n- White's queen on a3 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7d8: Rook lift to 8th rank, threatening to promote the g-pawn\n- a3a8: Queen to a8 to support the rook's promotion idea\n- b3d5: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Black counterplay\n- h1h2: King safety move\n\n4. Best plan:\nThe most forcing and promising idea is to promote the g-pawn with support from the rook. The immediate d7d8 looks strong as it:\n- Threatens to promote the g-pawn (g4-g5-g6 etc)\n- Pins Black's bishop to the king\n- Creates mating threats against the exposed king\n\nOther moves like a3a8 are also good, but d7d8 is more direct and forces Black to react immediately.\n\nAfter d7d8, Black's best reply would likely be ...Bxd8, but then White can play g5 with a strong initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd7d8\n```"
