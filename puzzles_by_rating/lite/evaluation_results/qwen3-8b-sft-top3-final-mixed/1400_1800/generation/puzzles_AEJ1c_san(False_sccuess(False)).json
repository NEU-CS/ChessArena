When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Queen, Rook, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White might be slightly better)\n\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on g5\n- Black king is relatively safe on g8\n- Black has a rook on h1 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on d8 is eyeing the b6 square (attacking our rook)\n- Black's rook on h1 could potentially check our king\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g5h6: King moves towards black's pawn, but exposes to potential checks\n- g5f4: King moves away from center, but might be safer\n- b7e7: Rook moves to defend against queen checks\n\nAfter considering:\n- g5h6 looks risky as it brings the king closer to black's pieces\n- g5f4 is safer but doesn't address the rook's potential checks\n- b7e7 is the most active move, defending against the queen's threat while keeping our rook active\n\nThe best move is to defend against the immediate threat while maintaining piece activity.\n\n```\nb7e7\n```"
