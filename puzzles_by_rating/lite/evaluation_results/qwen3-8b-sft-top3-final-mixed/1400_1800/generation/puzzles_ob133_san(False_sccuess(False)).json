When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on d5\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's rook on g4 is very active\n- Black's knight on d3 is well placed but could be trapped\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxd3 winning the knight\n- White could also play Rg8+ winning the rook\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: King moves to safety but allows Qxd3\n- a8g8: Rook blocks the check but allows Qxd3\n- h7g8: Queen blocks the check but allows Qxd3\n- d3e5: Knight moves to attack the rook, but after Qxe5 Rxe5, White is better\n- c4c3: Pushing the pawn to create counterplay\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be c4c3, creating immediate counterplay with the passed pawn while also preventing Qxd3 (as the knight would then be protected by the pawn). This gives Black active play and chances to equalize.\n\n```\nc4c3\n```"
