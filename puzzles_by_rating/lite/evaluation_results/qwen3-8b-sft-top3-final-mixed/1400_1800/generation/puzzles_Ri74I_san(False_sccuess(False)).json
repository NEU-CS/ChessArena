When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a passed pawn on b4, but it's blockaded by White's b3 pawn\n3. White's king is more active than Black's\n4. Black's king is somewhat restricted by White's pawns\n5. White has a passed f-pawn that could become dangerous\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e3f3 - King moves towards center and Black's pawns\n2. f4e5 - Pawn capture, but this opens lines for Black's king\n3. f4f5 - Advances the passed pawn\n4. g3g4 - Creates a passed pawn on the kingside\n\nAfter considering:\n- f4f5 looks tempting to push the passed pawn, but after ...gxf5, Black's king can become more active\n- e3f3 is solid, centralizing the king and preparing to support the f-pawn's advance\n- g3g4 creates a passed pawn but may be premature as Black can respond with ...h5\n\nThe most precise move appears to be e3f3, improving the king's position while maintaining all options. This keeps pressure on Black's position and prepares to support the f-pawn's advance later.\n\n```\ne3f3\n```"
