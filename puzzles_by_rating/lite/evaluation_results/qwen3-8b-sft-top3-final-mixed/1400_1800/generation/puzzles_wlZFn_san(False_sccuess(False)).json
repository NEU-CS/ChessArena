When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized knight on c4 and active pieces\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced in front\n4. White's queen on d3 is very active, eyeing the f5 square and potentially threatening Qxf5+\n5. Black's bishop on c6 is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the threat of Qxf5+ which would win a pawn and expose the king\n- Need to activate the rook on d8 which is currently passive\n- Need to deal with the strong knight on c4\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. d5f6 - blocks the queen's path to f5 and develops the knight\n2. e7g5 - blocks the queen's path to f5 with the bishop\n3. d8d7 - connects rooks and prepares to double on the d-file\n4. c6e8 - develops the bishop to a more active diagonal\n\nAfter considering:\n- d5f6 looks most principled as it blocks the queen's threat while developing the knight to a good square where it can potentially jump to e4 or g4\n- e7g5 is also possible but leaves the bishop on a less active diagonal\n- d8d7 is too passive and doesn't address the immediate threat\n- c6e8 doesn't solve the Qxf5+ problem\n\nThe move d5f6 also prevents any potential discovered attacks from the bishop on e7 if the queen moves.\n\n```\nd5f6\n```"
