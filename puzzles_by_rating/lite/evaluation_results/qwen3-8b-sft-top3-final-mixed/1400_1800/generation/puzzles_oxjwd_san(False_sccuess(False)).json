When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's rook is very active on c2, threatening to capture the a2 pawn\n- White's bishop is very strong on f7, controlling key squares\n- Black's knight on d4 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: f7g8 (threatening to promote), f7e8 (forking king and rook)\n- Rook moves: a1f1 (defending f4 pawn), a1c1 (challenging black's active rook)\n- King moves: g1h1 (getting away from potential checks)\n- Pawn moves: f4f5 (gaining space), g3g4 (preparing to push pawns)\n\n4. Critical threats:\n- Black could play Rc1+ next move, forcing the king to move\n- Black could also play Nf3+ with a discovered attack on the rook\n\nAfter considering these factors, the most forcing and advantageous move appears to be f7e8, which:\n- Forks the black king and rook\n- Forces Black to lose material (either the rook or king)\n- After Kxe8, White can play Rxe8+ winning the rook\n- Even if Black tries to defend with Rc1+, White has Rxc1+ Kxc1 and is up a bishop for a pawn\n\nThis seems like the most decisive continuation.\n\n```\nf7e8\n```"
