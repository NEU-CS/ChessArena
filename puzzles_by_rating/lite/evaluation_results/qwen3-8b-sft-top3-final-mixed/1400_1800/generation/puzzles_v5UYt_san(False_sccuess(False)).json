When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook on c3, bishop on f8, queen on b6, pawns on b5, d5, e6, f7, g6, h7, and king on h8.\n\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- White has a strong knight on h7 that's very active\n- Black's queen on b6 is unprotected\n- White's queen on f2 is very powerful, eyeing the f7 pawn\n- Black's rook on c3 is attacking White's pawn on b4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7f8: Forking king and bishop, but after ...Kxf8 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- f2f7: Threatening mate on f8, but Black can defend with ...Qxf7\n- h4g6: Forking queen and pawn, but Black can take with ...Qxg6\n- f2e3: Protecting the b4 pawn while centralizing the queen\n- h7f6: Forking queen and pawn, but Black can take with ...Qxf6\n\n4. Best move appears to be h7f8:\n- It forks the king and bishop\n- After ...Kxf8, White can play Qxf7+ winning the queen\n- Even if Black tries ...Bxf8, White has Qxf7+ winning the queen\n- It maintains strong pressure while winning material\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to maintain their position. The knight fork is the most forcing and decisive continuation.\n\n```\nh7f8\n```"
