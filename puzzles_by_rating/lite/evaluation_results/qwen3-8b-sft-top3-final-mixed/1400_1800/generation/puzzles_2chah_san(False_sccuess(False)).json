When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is stuck in the center (g1) with no pawn cover\n- White has a very active queen on h5 attacking f7\n- Black's bishop on a1 is trapped but defended by the rook\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8\n\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxf7+ winning the rook\n- White also has potential discovered attacks with the knight on c6\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 - gets the king to safety but allows Qxf7+\n- f8g8 - moves king away from potential checks but still allows Qxf7+\n- d8e7 - blocks the queen's path to f7 while developing the queen\n- c6e5 - knight move attacking the queen while developing\n- a1f6 - bishop sacrifice to open up White's king\n\nAfter careful consideration, d8e7 seems most prudent:\n- It blocks the queen's attack on f7\n- Develops the queen to a more active square\n- Maintains material equality\n- Keeps options open for future play\n\nOther moves either allow immediate material loss or don't address the immediate threat.\n\n```\nd8e7\n```"
