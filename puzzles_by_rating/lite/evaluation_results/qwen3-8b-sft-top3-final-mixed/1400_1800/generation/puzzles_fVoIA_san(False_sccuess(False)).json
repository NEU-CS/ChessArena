When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has knight + pawns vs Black's knight + pawns. Material is equal, but White has a passed pawn on f4.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on f5, while White's king is relatively safe on g1.\n\n3. Key features:\n   - White's knight on e5 is very active\n   - Black's knight on d4 is blocking White's c-pawn\n   - Black's pawn on e6 is weak and could be a target\n   - White's f-pawn is passed and could become dangerous\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e5f7: Forking king and pawn, but Black can play Kxf7\n   - e5d7: Attacking the e6 pawn, but Black can defend with Nc6\n   - e5g6: Threatening to win the h6 pawn, but Black can play Kxg6\n   - e5c6: Forking king and pawn, but Black can play Kxc6\n   - h2h4: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n\nThe most promising move appears to be e5d7, attacking the e6 pawn. After 1. Nde5-d7 Nc6 (defending e6), White can play 2. fxe5, opening the f-file and creating threats against Black's king. This seems like the most forcing line that maintains White's advantage.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5d7\n```"
