When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong pawn center with e5 and d6, but White has good piece activity\n3. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White has castled\n4. Black's bishop on f7 is very active, eyeing the g2 pawn\n5. White has a potential kingside attack with pieces aimed at f7/g7\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- c4f7: Bishop sacrifice to open Black's king\n- f3g5: Knight move threatening f7 and h7\n- c1g5: Developing the bishop with tempo on f6\n- d3d4: Challenging Black's center\n\nThe most forcing and promising move appears to be c4f7, sacrificing the bishop to open Black's king. After:\n1. Bxf7+ Rxf7\n2. Nxe5! (winning the exchange as the rook must move)\nBlack's king will be very exposed and White can follow up with strong attacks.\n\nOther moves like f3g5 are good but not as immediately decisive. The bishop sacrifice leads to concrete advantages.\n\n```\nc4f7\n```"
