If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

But currently, it's just pressuring the diagonal.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWe'll evaluate some of the more promising options:\n\n#### 1. `g6h7` \u2013 King moves to h7\n- This gets the king off the open g-file and away from potential threats.\n- It avoids immediate danger and gives the king a bit more shelter.\n- Seems like a solid defensive move.\n\n#### 2. `d5d8` \u2013 Rook takes queen!\n- The rook on d5 can capture the white queen on c8.\n- Is this safe? Let's check:\n  - After `d5d8`, White can respond with `Rxd8`, so you'd have to recapture with the queen: `Qxd8`.\n  - Then White plays `Rxc8`, and you're down a rook for a queen \u2014 not bad, but not a big gain.\n  - Also, after `d5d8 Rxd8 Qxd8`, White still has a strong position with active pieces.\n\nSo while it wins the queen, it leads to simplification and may not be best in a sharp position.\n\n#### 3. `b4f8` \u2013 Bishop to f8\n- This threatens the rook on f1 and potentially creates counterplay.\n- However, it seems a bit slow and doesn't address the king safety issue.\n\n#### 4. `a4e8` \u2013 Rook to e8\n- Pressures the e-file and supports possible counterplay.\n- Again, not urgent enough.\n\n#### 5. `g6f6` \u2013 King to f6\n- Centralizes the king slightly, but exposes it further.\n- Not ideal.\n\n#### 6. `g6f7` \u2013 King to f7\n- Also centralizes, but again, risky.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\n\nThe most pressing concern is **king safety**. Black\u2019s king is in the open and vulnerable. The best way to proceed is to **move the king to h7**, getting it off the dangerous g-file and into a slightly safer square.\n\nThis move also prepares for possible future counterplay without exposing the king further.\n\n---\n\n```\ng6h7\n```"
