When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has king, bishop, pawns at d4, h4, f2\n- Black has king, bishop, pawns at g7, h5, c2\n- Material is roughly equal, but black has a passed pawn on c2 that's about to promote\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is very active on e6\n- Black's bishop on g2 is controlling important squares\n- Black's c-pawn is one move from promotion\n- White's bishop on g5 is controlling the c1 promotion square\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c2c1q: Promotes to queen, but white can take with bishop (Bxc1)\n- c2c1r: Promotes to rook, but still loses to Bxc1\n- c2c1b: Promotes to bishop, but then Kxc1 and black loses the pawn\n- c2c1n: Promotes to knight, which can't be captured by bishop\n- Other bishop moves don't seem as forcing\n\n4. Best continuation:\n- c2c1n is the only move that maintains the pawn after promotion\n- After c2c1n, white can take with bishop (Bxc1)\n- Then black can play Kxg5, winning the bishop\n- This leads to a winning king and pawn endgame for black\n\nThe other moves either lose the pawn immediately or don't create threats. Promoting to knight is the most resilient option.\n\n```\nc2c1n\n```"
