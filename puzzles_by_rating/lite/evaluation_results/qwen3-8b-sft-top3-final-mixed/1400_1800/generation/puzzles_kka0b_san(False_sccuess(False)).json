When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's rooks are very active on the e and d files\n4. Our bishop on b5 is under attack by the pawn on c6\n5. Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on e3 is a major threat that needs to be addressed\n- We have several ways to deal with it: move the rook, capture it, or block it\n- The bishop on b5 is also under pressure and needs to be saved or traded\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c3d5 - attacking the knight and developing the knight\n2. d1d8 - trading rooks to relieve pressure\n3. b5e8 - sacrificing the bishop to open the position\n4. c3e4 - attacking the knight and developing\n\nAfter considering these:\n- c3d5 looks tempting but after ...Nxd5 we lose material\n- d1d8 is solid but gives up the active rook\n- b5e8 is interesting but after ...Rxe8 we're down material\n- c3e4 seems best, attacking the knight while developing and maintaining material balance\n\nThe move c3e4:\n- Attacks the knight on e3\n- Develops the knight to a more active square\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\nOther moves either lose material or give up too much activity. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc3e4\n```"
