When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on f3\n- Black has a passed pawn on h5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on c1 is very active\n- White's f5 pawn is under attack by Black's bishop on g6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5g6: Capturing the bishop, but after hxg6 White's king remains exposed\n- d3d8: Queen trade, but after Rxd8 Kxd8, Black's pawns become too strong\n- d3d7: Blocking the bishop's diagonal while attacking the rook\n- f3e4: Moving the king to a safer square\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3d7:\n- It blocks the bishop's diagonal\n- Attacks the rook on c1\n- If Black moves the rook (Rc7), then Qxc7 wins the rook\n- If Black takes the queen (Rxd7), then Kxd7 and White's king is safer\n- It maintains material equality while improving White's position\n\nOther moves either leave the king exposed or don't address the immediate threats. The queen move is most active and creates complications in White's favor.\n\n```\nd3d7\n```"
