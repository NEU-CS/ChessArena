When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b7 is very active, attacking the black queen on d8\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed pawn on e3 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on c2 is active but can be challenged\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: b7c8 (discovered check), b7f7 (threatening mate), b7e7 (attacking rook)\n- King moves: g2h3 (improving king safety)\n- Rook moves: h1g1 (connecting rooks)\n- Pawn moves: e3e4 (advancing passed pawn)\n\n4. Best options:\n- b7f7 looks very strong as it threatens Qf7# (mate in 1)\n- Black's only way to prevent mate is Qxf7, but then White can play Qxf7+ Kxf7 and White is up a rook\n- Other queen moves don't create immediate threats\n- Other moves are less forcing\n\nAfter careful consideration, b7f7 is the most forcing and decisive move, leading to a clear advantage for White.\n\n```\nb7f7\n```"
