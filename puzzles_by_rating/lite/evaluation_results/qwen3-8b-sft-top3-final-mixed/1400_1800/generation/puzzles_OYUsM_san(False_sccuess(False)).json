When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black has a slight advantage with the knight.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g6 is very active, eyeing the g2 pawn\n- White's rook on e4 is under attack by Black's knight on e5\n- White's bishop on e3 is blocked by its own pawn on c4\n- Black's rook on d3 is very active, pinning the c2 queen to the king\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...Qxg2# if not addressed\n- Black also has ...Nxc4 winning a pawn\n- White needs to deal with both threats while maintaining activity\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4h4: Rook moves away from attack but doesn't solve Qxg2 threat\n- e3g5: Blocks the queen's path to g2 while attacking the knight\n- c2d3: Queen moves to block the pin but allows ...Qxg2+\n- e4e5: Capturing the knight but allowing ...Qxg2+\n\nAfter careful consideration, e3g5 seems best because:\n- It blocks the queen's path to g2\n- It attacks the knight on e5\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It doesn't allow any immediate counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't address both threats or allow immediate mate or material loss.\n\n```\ne3g5\n```"
