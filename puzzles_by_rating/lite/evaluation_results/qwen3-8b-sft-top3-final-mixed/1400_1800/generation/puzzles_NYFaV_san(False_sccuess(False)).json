When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and queen vs Black's rook, bishop and queen. Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g6 is very active, eyeing the g3 queen and f2 pawn\n- White's knight on g5 is well placed but potentially trapped\n- Black's rook on h8 is ready to swing to h1 or h2\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black has potential threats like ...Qxg3 or ...Rxh2+\n- White needs to address these while maintaining activity\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h7: Knight sacrifice to remove the dangerous rook\n- g3h4: Moving the queen to safety while attacking the bishop\n- g3g4: Blocking the rook's path to h2\n- a1h1: Rook lift to defend against potential checks\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- g5h7 looks tempting but after ...Rxh7, White doesn't have enough compensation\n- g3h4 is interesting but Black can play ...Bxh4 and the position remains complicated\n- g3g4 is solid, preventing ...Rxh2+ and maintaining queen safety\n- a1h1 is too passive\n\nThe best move appears to be g3g4, which:\n- Prevents immediate threats to the queen and king\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps options open for future play\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
