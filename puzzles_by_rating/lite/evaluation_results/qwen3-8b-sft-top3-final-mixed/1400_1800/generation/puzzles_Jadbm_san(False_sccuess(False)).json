When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and queen vs Black's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. White is up material (queen vs rook+bishop+knight).\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on d7\n- White's queen on b7 is very active\n- Black has threats with the bishop on c4 attacking the rook on a1\n- White's rook on e1 is undefended\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7c8: Queen takes rook with check, but after ...Kxc8 we lose our queen for rook\n- b7b8: Queen takes rook, but then ...Bxb8 and we lose our queen for bishop\n- e1e8: Rook takes rook, but then ...Qxe8 and we lose our rook for queen\n- a1a2: Defends against the bishop threat, but passive\n- e1e7: Rook checks the king, but after ...Kc8 we don't have enough follow-up\n\n4. Best move seems to be b7c8+:\n- Forces the king to take: ...Kxc8\n- Then we can play a1a2, defending our rook\n- After ...Bxa2, we have Qxa2 with a winning material advantage (queen vs rook+bishop+knight)\n\nThis sequence wins material while maintaining our active pieces. Other moves either don't win material or allow counterplay.\n\n```\nb7c8\n```"
