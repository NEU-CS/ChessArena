When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal, but White's queen is very active on b8.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on b8 is eyeing the g3 pawn and could potentially create mating threats\n- White's rook on c2 is controlling the c-file\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7f7: King moves towards center but exposes to checks\n- c6e8: Queen moves to defend g3 pawn and attacks White's queen\n- d5d8: Rook moves to defend against White's queen\n- c4c3: Pawn push to create counterplay\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e8:\n- Defends the g3 pawn which is under attack from White's queen\n- Attacks White's queen on b8, forcing it to move or be captured\n- Maintains control of the position\n- After Qxe8, Black can play Rxd8 winning the exchange\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. The pawn push c4c3 is tempting but premature as it weakens the pawn structure.\n\n```\nc6e8\n```"
