When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except Black is missing a knight)\n2. White has a strong knight on d5, but it's currently attacked by Black's bishop on g7\n3. Black's king is still in the center, which could be dangerous\n4. White has pressure on the e5 pawn and potential threats against Black's king\n5. Black's rook on h8 is undeveloped\n\nKey considerations:\n- The knight on d5 is a thorn in Black's position and needs to be dealt with\n- Black needs to complete development and get the king to safety\n- The bishop on g7 is pinning the knight to the queen, which is valuable\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g7f6 - Capturing the knight immediately, but after exf6 the e-file opens for White's rook\n2. c5d7 - Forking queen and bishop, but White can play Qxd7 Bxd7 and Black loses the bishop pair\n3. e8g8 - Castling to safety, but the knight on d5 remains a problem\n4. g7d4 - Moving the bishop to a more active square while maintaining the pin\n\nAfter considering these, g7d4 seems most promising because:\n- It maintains the pin on the knight\n- Develops the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- Keeps options open for castling later\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\nThe alternatives either leave the knight on d5 or create other problems. While castling is tempting, dealing with the knight first is more urgent.\n\n```\ng7d4\n```"
