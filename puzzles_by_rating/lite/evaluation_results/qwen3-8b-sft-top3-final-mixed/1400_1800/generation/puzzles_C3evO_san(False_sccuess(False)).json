When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on c7 attacking the rook on d8\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed e5 pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black's rooks are not well coordinated\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8f7: Gets the king to safety but blocks the f-file\n- f8f7: Covers the f5 pawn but leaves the king exposed\n- d8d7: Moves the rook away from attack while maintaining pressure\n- c6e8: Blocks the knight's attack on the rook while developing the bishop\n\n4. Best options:\n- c6e8 seems most principled, blocking the knight's attack while developing the bishop to a more active square. It also maintains control over key squares.\n- d8d7 is solid but passive, allowing White to maintain initiative.\n\nAfter considering these factors, the best move appears to be:\n\n```\nc6e8\n```"
