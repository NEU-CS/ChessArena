When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized queen on d4 and knight on f5\n3. Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n4. Black's knight on g4 is under attack by White's pawn on e3\n5. Black's bishop on d7 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on g4 is hanging and needs to be dealt with\n- White's queen and knight are very active\n- Black needs to address the immediate threat to the knight while developing counterplay\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g4h6 - moves the knight to safety but blocks the h-file\n2. g4f6 - centralizes the knight but it's still under attack from e3\n3. g4e5 - forks queen and bishop, but after Qxe5 Bxe5, White has compensation\n4. d7e6 - develops the bishop and defends the knight, but allows Qxd5\n5. d8g5 - brings queen into attack, but White can play Qxg4\n\nAfter considering these, the most solid move appears to be g4h6, moving the knight to safety while keeping options open. Other moves either lose material or lead to worse positions.\n\n```\ng4h6\n```"
