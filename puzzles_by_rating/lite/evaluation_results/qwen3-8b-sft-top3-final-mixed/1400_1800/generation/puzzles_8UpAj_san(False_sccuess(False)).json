When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White's rook on a7 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could be dangerous\n- White's knight is well placed on f3, eyeing potential forks\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: a7a8 looks tempting to check the king, but after ...Kf7 it's not clear what's next\n- Knight moves: f3g5 threatens to fork king and rook with Ng5+, but Black can defend with ...Ke7\n- Pawn moves: c3c4 could be interesting to block the d-pawn's advance\n\n4. Best move seems to be a7a8+:\n- Forces the black king to move (only legal reply is ...Kf7)\n- Then we can play Ng5+ forking king and rook\n- After ...Ke7, we have Ra7+ winning the rook on e5\n\nLet me verify this line:\n1. a7a8+ Kf7\n2. Ng5+ Ke7\n3. Ra7+ Kf6\n4. Nxe5 and White wins the rook\n\nThis seems clearly winning. Other moves don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate.\n\n```\na7a8\n```"
