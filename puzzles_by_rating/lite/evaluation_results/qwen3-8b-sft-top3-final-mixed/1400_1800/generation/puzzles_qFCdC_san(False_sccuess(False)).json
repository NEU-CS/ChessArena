When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns)\n2. White has a strong pawn center with d4 and e5 pawns\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the f6 pawn advanced\n4. White's pieces are more active - the knight on h4 is well placed, bishop on d3 is strong\n5. Black's pieces are a bit cramped, especially the rooks on the back rank\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the threat of White's e5 pawn advancing (e5-e6 could be dangerous)\n- Need to activate Black's pieces\n- Need to find counterplay against White's strong center\n\nCandidate moves worth considering:\n1. f6e5 - Capturing the pawn immediately, but after dxe5 White's center becomes even stronger\n2. c5d4 - Challenging White's center, but after cxd4 White has a strong passed pawn\n3. c6e5 - Centralizing the knight, but it's not clear if this solves the problems\n4. f8f7 - Connecting rooks and preparing to double on the f-file\n5. g7g6 - Preparing to fianchetto the bishop and challenge White's center\n\nAfter careful consideration, f8f7 seems most prudent:\n- Connects the rooks\n- Prepares to double on the f-file against White's king\n- Maintains flexibility to respond to e5-e6 with ...f7-f6\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the central tension or create new weaknesses. The position remains complex, but f8f7 keeps Black solid while looking for counterplay.\n\n```\nf8f7\n```"
