When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns)\n2. White has a strong centralized queen on e4 and bishop on h4 eyeing the f6 square\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated - the rook on a8 is inactive, and the bishop on c8 is blocked by pawns\n5. White has potential threats like Qxf4 or Bxf6\n\nKey observations:\n- White's queen and bishop are very active and coordinated\n- Black needs to address the immediate threats while improving piece coordination\n- The f4-bishop is a key defender of Black's position\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f4g5 - This seems tempting to trade the bishop, but after Qxg5 White maintains strong pressure\n2. f4e5 - Centralizing the bishop, but it blocks the e5 square for the queen\n3. d5e7 - Moving the knight to defend f5 and e7 squares\n4. c8b7 - Developing the bishop and connecting rooks\n\nAfter careful consideration, f4g5 seems the most forcing move:\n- It trades off White's dangerous bishop\n- After Qxg5, Black can play ...Qxg5 and the position becomes more balanced\n- Other moves allow White to maintain strong pressure with both pieces\n\nThe alternatives either don't address the immediate threats or worsen Black's coordination.\n\n```\nf4g5\n```"
