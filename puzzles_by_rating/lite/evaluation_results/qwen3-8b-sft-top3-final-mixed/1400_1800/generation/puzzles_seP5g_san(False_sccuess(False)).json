When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on h4, eyeing the h2 pawn and potentially threatening mate on h1\n- White's rook on e4 is very strong, controlling the e-file and pinning the black pawn on d6\n- White's knight on d4 is well placed, with several good options\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is Qxh2# if not addressed\n- White needs to deal with this while maintaining the initiative\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e3h3: Blocks the queen's path to h2, but allows Qxh3\n- e3g3: Blocks the queen's path to h2 and defends h3, but allows Qxg3+\n- e4e7: Rook sacrifice to expose the black king, but after Kxe7, White doesn't have enough follow-up\n- d4f5: Knight moves to attack the queen, but Qxh2# is still coming\n- e4e8: Rook to e8, but doesn't address the mate threat\n- e3f2: Defends h2 and covers f2, but allows Qxh2+\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is e3g3. While it allows Qxg3+, White can then play Qxg3+ Kxg3 and the position remains balanced with White's active pieces. Other moves either allow mate or don't address the immediate threat effectively.\n\n```\ne3g3\n```"
