When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and 3 pawns vs Black's rook and 2 pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on b4, controlling the b-file\n- Black's rook is on g1, potentially threatening to check the white king\n- Black's king is on g6, somewhat exposed\n- White's king is on h4, also exposed but has some pawn cover\n- White has a passed pawn on e4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b4b8: Rook lift to 8th rank, but doesn't immediately threaten anything\n- b4b7: Attacks the g7 pawn, but black can defend with ...Rg1-g7\n- b4b6: Attacks the f6 pawn, but black can defend with ...Rg1-f1\n- e4e5: Advances the passed pawn, but allows ...Rg1-e1 pin\n- f3f4: Creates a passed pawn but weakens the king's position\n\n4. Best move seems to be b4b7:\n- Attacks the g7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If black defends with ...Rg1-g7, we can play e4-e5 creating a passed pawn\n- If black doesn't defend, we can take the pawn with Rb7xg7+\n- Maintains control of the b-file\n- Limits black's rook mobility\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow black to consolidate. The rook move to b7 creates the most problems for black.\n\n```\nb4b7\n```"
