When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black is up material but White has some counterplay.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on g7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- Black's queen is centralized but needs to be careful about checks\n- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rg6+ next move, forcing the black king to move\n- The h-pawn could advance if not stopped\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h6h5: Gets the king away from potential checks but leaves it exposed\n- c4g8: Blocks the rook's path to the king but allows Rg6+\n- c4f7: Blocks the rook and covers g6, but allows Rg6+ after Qxf7\n- c4e6: Centralizes the queen but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d4d3: Pushes the pawn but doesn't help with defense\n\n5. Best move seems to be c4g8:\n- It blocks the rook's path to the king\n- After Rg6+, we can play Qxg6+ Kxg6, and our king is safer\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It prevents immediate threats while keeping our queen active\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new weaknesses. c4g8 is the most solid choice that maintains our material advantage while neutralizing White's immediate threats.\n\n```\nc4g8\n```"
