When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on f5\n- Black's king is exposed on d7\n- White's rook on d3 is very active\n- Black's bishop on c3 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on d4\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rd7+ winning the knight on d5\n- White could push f6, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Blocking the f-pawn but leaves king exposed\n- d5f6: Capturing the pawn but allows Rd7+ winning the knight\n- c3d4: Breaking the pin but allows Bxd4 winning a piece\n- d7e8: Moving king away from potential checks\n- c4d6: Developing the knight to a better square\n\nAfter considering these options, the best move appears to be d7e8, moving the king to safety while keeping the knight defended. This prevents any immediate threats and maintains the position's balance.\n\n```\nd7e8\n```"
