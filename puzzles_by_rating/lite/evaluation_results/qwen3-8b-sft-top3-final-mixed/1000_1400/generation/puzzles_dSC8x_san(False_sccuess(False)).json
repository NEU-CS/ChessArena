When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a queen and bishop, while Black has a queen and a pawn on g4 (which is advanced and dangerous). Black\u2019s king is in the center but relatively safe for now. White\u2019s king is on h1, which is passive but not immediately under threat.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **White Queen on d5** is very active and has many possible moves.\n- **Black Queen on f4** is also active and threatening.\n- **Black King on g4** is exposed and could be vulnerable to a mating net.\n- **White Bishop on d3** is well-placed, eyeing the long diagonal.\n- **White has a passed pawn on a3**, but it's not immediately relevant.\n- **Black has a dangerous passed pawn on g4**, which could promote if not stopped.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### From the list of legal moves:\n- **d5g8**: Queen to g8 \u2013 threatens mate on g7 if Black doesn't respond properly.\n- **d5d8**: Queen to d8 \u2013 threatens mate on g5 or g7.\n- **d5a8**: Queen to a8 \u2013 less useful.\n- **d5f7**: Queen to f7 \u2013 checks the king and attacks g6.\n- **d5d7**: Queen to d7 \u2013 supports potential bishop moves.\n- **d5b7**: Queen to b7 \u2013 not particularly useful.\n- **d5e6**: Queen to e6 \u2013 threatens mate on g8.\n- **d5d6**: Queen to d6 \u2013 controls more space.\n- **d5c6**: Queen to c6 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d5h5**: Queen to h5 \u2013 threatens mate on g6.\n- **d5g5**: Queen to g5 \u2013 checks the king and attacks g6.\n- **d5f5**: Queen to f5 \u2013 checks the king and attacks g6.\n- **d5e5**: Queen to e5 \u2013 controls key squares.\n- **d5c5**: Queen to c5 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d5e4**: Queen to e4 \u2013 checks the king and attacks g6.\n- **d5d4**: Queen to d4 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d5c4**: Queen to c4 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d5f3**: Queen to f3 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d5b3**: Queen to b3 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d5a2**: Queen to a2 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3h7**: Bishop to h7 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3g6**: Bishop to g6 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3a6**: Bishop to a6 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3f5**: Bishop to f5 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3b5**: Bishop to b5 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3e4**: Bishop to e4 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3c4**: Bishop to c4 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3e2**: Bishop to e2 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3c2**: Bishop to c2 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3f1**: Bishop to f1 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **d3b1**: Bishop to b1 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **h1g1**: King to g1 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **a3a4**: Pawn to a4 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **g2g3**: Pawn to g3 \u2013 blocks the dangerous g4 pawn.\n- **b2b3**: Pawn to b3 \u2013 not very useful.\n- **b2b4**: Pawn to b4 \u2013 not very useful.\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be:\n\n#### `d5g5` \u2013 Queen to g5, checking the Black king.\n\nWhy?\n\n- It **checks** the Black king.\n- It **attacks** the g6 square, which is a key escape square for the Black king.\n- It **threatens mate** on g6 if the king moves to h5 or f5.\n- It **forces Black to respond**, giving White the initiative.\n\nLet\u2019s look at what happens after `d5g5`:\n\n- If Black plays `Kxg5`, then `Bxg4` wins the dangerous pawn and leaves Black with no counterplay.\n- If Black plays `Kh5`, then `Qg6#` is checkmate.\n- If Black plays `Kf5`, then `Qg6#` is checkmate.\n\nSo this move either wins material or delivers checkmate.\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\nd5g5\n```"
