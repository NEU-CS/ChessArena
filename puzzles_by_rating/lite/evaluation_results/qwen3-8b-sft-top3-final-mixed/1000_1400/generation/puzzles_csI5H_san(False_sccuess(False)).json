When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Knight, Queen, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White might be slightly better)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on f5, eyeing the f2 pawn\n- White's knight on b5 is well placed, attacking c7 and d6\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on b1\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- b1a2: Moves the king to safety but seems passive\n- e3e4: Advances the pawn, but blocks the queen's defense of f2\n- e3d3: Moves the queen to defend f2 while keeping options open\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Qxf2+ winning the pawn\n- Black could push ...c3 creating a passed pawn\n\nAfter considering all options, e3d3 seems best because:\n- It defends the f2 pawn against ...Qxf2+\n- Maintains the queen's activity\n- Keeps options to bring the rook into play via d1\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nThe other moves have drawbacks:\n- b1a2 is too passive and doesn't address the immediate threats\n- e3e4 would leave f2 undefended after ...Qxf2+\n\n```\ne3d3\n```"
