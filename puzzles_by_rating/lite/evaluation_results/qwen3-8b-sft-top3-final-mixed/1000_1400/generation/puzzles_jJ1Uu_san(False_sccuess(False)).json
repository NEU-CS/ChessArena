When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on c7 is very strong, attacking the queen on d8\n- Black's queen is unprotected and vulnerable\n- White has a passed pawn on f4 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7e8: Forking queen and king, but after ...Qxe8 White doesn't gain much\n- c7a8: Winning the rook, but Black can play ...Qxc7\n- c7e6: Forking queen and bishop, but Black can play ...Qxe6\n- c3c6: Threatening the queen, but Black can defend with ...Qd7\n- f4e5: Opening the position when White's pieces are better placed\n\n4. Best move appears to be c7e8:\n- It's a forcing move that wins the queen after ...Qxe8 Nxe8\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White maintains strong pressure\n- Other moves either don't win material or allow Black to consolidate\n\nAfter c7e8, if Black takes with the queen, White recaptures and is up material. If Black doesn't take, White maintains the initiative.\n\n```\nc7e8\n```"
