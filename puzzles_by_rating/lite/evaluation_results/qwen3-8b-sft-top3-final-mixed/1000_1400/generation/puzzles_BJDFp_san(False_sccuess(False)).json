When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's rook on g6 is very active, eyeing our g2 pawn\n4. Our knight on g5 is very active but potentially trapped\n5. Black's queen on d8 is somewhat passive but could become active\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on g5 is under attack by Black's rook on g6\n- If we move the knight, we need to consider where it can go safely\n- Our queen on d2 is very active and could create threats\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5h7 - Forking king and rook, but after ...Kxh7 we lose the knight\n2. g5f7 - Attacking the queen, but after ...Qxf7 we lose the knight\n3. g5e6 - Centralizing the knight, but it's still under attack\n4. d2a5 - Threatening the rook on a8, but Black can defend\n5. e1e4 - Centralizing the rook, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\nThe most promising move appears to be g5h7, sacrificing the knight to expose Black's king:\n- After 1. Nxh7 Kxh7, we can play 2. Qxg6+ Kh8 3. Qh6+ Kg8 4. Qh5 with strong attacking chances\n- Black's king will be very exposed and our pieces will be well coordinated\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't create enough counterplay. The sacrifice leads to a dangerous attack against Black's king.\n\n```\ng5h7\n```"
