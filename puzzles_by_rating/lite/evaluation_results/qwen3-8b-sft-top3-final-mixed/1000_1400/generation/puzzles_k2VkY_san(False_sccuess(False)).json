When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Let's see what happens:\n  - `h5h3` Qxh3\n  - Then Black can play `f5g4+` (bishop check), forcing the white king to move.\n  - Then Black can follow up with `e8e1+` (rook check), possibly winning the rook on e1.\n  - This line looks very strong for Black.\n\n#### 2. `f5g4+` \u2013 Bishop check\n- Forces the white king to move.\n- But without capturing the queen first, this gives White time to regroup and defend.\n\n#### 3. `e8e1+` \u2013 Rook check\n- Could be useful later, but not as strong as taking the queen.\n\n#### 4. `c8c3` \u2013 Rook takes rook\n- Also tempting, but less so than taking the queen first.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move is:\n\n```\nh5h3\n```\n\nThis captures the white queen and leads to a forced sequence where Black gains a decisive advantage.\n\n---\n\n```\nh5h3\n```"
