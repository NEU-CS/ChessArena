When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's bishop on g5 is very active, attacking f6 and h6\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's rook on e1 is well placed\n- Black has a knight on f6 that's defending h7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h6: Bishop sacrifice, but after ...gxh6 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- g5f6: Bishop takes knight, but after ...gxf6 White's attack fizzles out\n- e1e8: Rook sacrifice to expose the king, but after ...Rxe8 White doesn't have enough\n- b3g8: Bishop sacrifice, but after ...Kxg8 White's attack is unclear\n- e1e7: Threatening mate on h7, but Black can defend with ...Rxe7\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e7:\n- Threatens mate in 1 with Re7-h7#\n- Black's only defense is ...Rxe7, but then Bxe7 and White has a strong attack\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Re7-h7# next move\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. e1e7 creates the most forcing continuation.\n\n```\ne1e7\n```"
