When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has a queen (Q), rook (R), bishop (B), knight (N) and pawns\n   - Black has a queen (q), rook (r), bishop (b), knight (n) and pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White has a very active position\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen on g7 is very dangerous, attacking the black king on e7\n   - White has a rook on d6 pinning the black pawn on c6 to the king\n   - White's bishop on c4 is very active, controlling important diagonals\n   - Black's king is exposed and in check from the queen on g7\n\n3. The only legal move given is d7d6, which is a pawn move. Let's see what happens after this:\n   - If d7d6, the pawn moves to d6, blocking the check from the queen\n   - However, this leaves the pawn on d6 pinned by White's rook on d6\n   - White can then play Qxg6, winning a pawn and maintaining pressure\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\n   - Black has no other legal moves (no pieces can interpose or block the check)\n   - The king cannot move because e8 is controlled by White's rook on h1\n   - No pieces can capture the checking queen\n\nSince d7d6 is the only legal move, we must play it despite the drawbacks. The position is lost for Black due to the overwhelming White attack, but we must make the only possible move.\n\n```\nd7d6\n```"
