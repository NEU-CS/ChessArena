When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Queen (c6), Rook (b1), pawns (h2, g2)\n   - Black has: Rook (b7), Queen (e2), pawns (a4, b5)\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's queen on c6 is attacking Black's rook on b7\n   - Black's queen on e2 is attacking White's rook on b1\n   - Black's king is on a6, which is somewhat exposed\n   - White's king is on h1, also exposed\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - a6a7: King moves forward, but this walks into potential checks\n   - a6a5: King moves backward, but still exposed\n   - b7b6: Rook moves, blocking the queen's attack while attacking White's queen\n\n4. Evaluating b7b6:\n   - After b7b6, White must deal with the threat to their queen\n   - If White takes the rook (Qxb6), then Black can play Qxe2 winning the rook\n   - If White moves their queen away, Black can then consider Qxb1 winning material\n   - This seems like the most forcing and advantageous move\n\n5. Other options:\n   - a6a7 allows White to play Qxb7+ winning the rook\n   - a6a5 doesn't solve the problem of the attacking queen\n\nThe best move is clearly b7b6, as it creates immediate threats and forces White to react defensively.\n\n```\nb7b6\n```"
