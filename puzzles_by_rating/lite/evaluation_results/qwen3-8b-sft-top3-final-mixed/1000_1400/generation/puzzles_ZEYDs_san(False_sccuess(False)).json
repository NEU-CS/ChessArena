When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop is very active on f7\n- Black's knight on e4 is centralized but can be challenged\n- Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed\n- White has passed pawns on a5 and g3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: f7g8 (threatening mate), f7e6 (attacking knight)\n- King moves: b5a6 (advancing passed pawn)\n- Pawn moves: g3g4 (gaining space)\n\n4. Critical lines:\n- f7g8 threatens mate in 1 (Bg8#)\n- Black can only defend with Kd7, but then Bxe4 wins material\n- Other bishop moves don't create immediate threats\n\n5. Other options:\n- b5a6 is tempting but allows Black counterplay with ...Nc3\n- g3g4 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n\nThe most forcing and decisive move is f7g8, which either leads to mate or significant material gain. Black has no good way to defend against both threats.\n\n```\nf7g8\n```"
