When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on d6 is very active, controlling the d-file and 6th rank\n- Black's rook on e3 is active but can be challenged\n- White has a passed pawn on b4, but it's blockaded by Black's b5 pawn\n- Black's king is on g7, White's king on f4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: d6d8 looks tempting to check the king, but after ...Kf7 the rook has no good follow-up\n- d6g6+ forces the king to move, but after ...Kh7 the rook has no immediate threats\n- d6e6 challenges Black's rook, but after ...Rxe6+ Kxe6, White's king becomes exposed\n- Pawn moves: h4h5 could be useful to create a passed pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6d8:\n- It checks the king and forces it to move\n- After ...Kf7, White can play Rd7+ winning the h7 pawn\n- Even if Black finds ...Kh6, White can maintain pressure with Rd6+\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. The rook check is the most forcing and disruptive move.\n\n```\nd6d8\n```"
