When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Bishop, Bishop, Queen, 2 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, Knight, 2 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's bishop on g6 is very strong, pinning the f7 pawn to the king\n   - Black's king is exposed on h8\n   - White has a passed pawn on g3 that could become dangerous\n   - Black's knight on b4 is well placed but not immediately threatening\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - h8g8: King moves to g8, getting away from the pin but still exposed\n   - h8g7: King moves to g7, which seems more dangerous as it walks into potential checks\n\n4. Evaluating h8g8:\n   - Gets the king away from the pin on the h-file\n   - Still leaves the king somewhat exposed on the g-file\n   - Doesn't immediately address any threats\n\n5. Evaluating h8g7:\n   - Walks into potential discovered checks from White's bishop on g6\n   - After ...Kg7, White could play Bf5+ winning the exchange\n   - This seems too dangerous\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - h8g8 is the safer choice, getting the king away from immediate danger\n   - While not perfect, it's the only move that doesn't immediately lose material\n\nThe best move is:\n```\nh8g8\n```"
