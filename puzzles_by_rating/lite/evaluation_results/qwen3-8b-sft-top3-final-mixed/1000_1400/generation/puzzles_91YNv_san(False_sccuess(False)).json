When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and your king is on **d5**. White has a pawn on **a4**, **f3**, and the king on **f2**. Black has pawns on **a5** and **h3**.\n\n### Goal:\nSince this is a king and pawn endgame, the goal is to promote a pawn or prevent the opponent from doing so.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- Black\u2019s king is centralized at d5.\n- White\u2019s king is on f2, trying to support the f3 pawn or race toward the queenside.\n- Black has a passed h-pawn on h3, which is very close to queening.\n- The black king can support the h-pawn directly.\n- The white king is too far away to stop the h-pawn in time.\n- Pushing the h-pawn immediately with **h3-h2** forces White to respond, but it may not be optimal yet.\n- Moving the king toward the h-pawn (e.g., **Ke6**, **Kd6**, etc.) supports the pawn and prepares for promotion.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n- `d5e6`, `d5d6`, `d5c6`, `d5e5`, `d5c5`, `d5d4`, `d5c4`, `h3h2`\n\nWe should focus on moves that help advance the h-pawn or protect it.\n\n#### Best Plan:\nMove the king closer to the h-pawn to support its promotion. The most direct route is via **e6** or **e5**.\n\nBetween them:\n- **...Ke6** (`d5e6`) brings the king one step closer to the h-file and keeps control over key squares.\n- From e6, the king can go to f5, then g4, supporting the h-pawn.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5e6\n```"
