Material count:\n- White has: Rook (e7), Rook (d7), Queen (h3), pawns (a3, b4, f5, g2, h2)\n- Black has: Bishop (g8), King (h8), pawns (a6, b5, d6, g5, h5)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rooks are very active on the 7th rank\n- Black's queen is centralized but potentially exposed\n- White's queen is well placed on h3, eyeing the h5 pawn\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h1g1: King safety move, but doesn't create threats\n- e7e4: Rook takes pawn, but allows Qxe4 with counterplay\n- h3g2: Queen takes pawn, but allows Qxg2 with counterplay\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- h3g2 seems most forcing:\n  - After Qxg2, Rxg2 and White is up a rook for a pawn\n  - Black's compensation is minimal (bishop vs rook)\n  - White can then bring the other rook into play\n\nThe other moves are too passive or allow Black counterplay. Taking the pawn with the queen is the most concrete way to gain material advantage.\n\n```\nh3g2\n```"

This is a **free queen** for White \u2014 an enormous material gain. After this capture, White will be up a full queen and have a decisive advantage.\n\nLet\u2019s verify that this move is safe:\n- The rook on e7 moves to e1, capturing the queen on d1.\n- There are no pieces protecting the queen on d1.\n- No immediate threats to White after the capture.\n\nOther moves (`g2g1`, `g2f1`) are passive and do not take advantage of the hanging queen.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhite should play **`e7e1`** to win the queen and secure a winning position.\n\n```\ne7e1\n```"

It maintains control and avoids unnecessary risks.\n\n---\n\n## Final Move:\n\n```\ng2g1\n```"
