When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Knight, Bishop vs Black's Rook, Bishop, Knight. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on a7 is very active, attacking the black rook on c8\n- Black has a knight on b4 that's forking white's b2 pawn and rook on a7\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n- Black has pressure on the f-file with rook on f8 and pawn on f6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7a8: Trading rooks but leaves white's rook vulnerable\n- a7f7: Attacking the f6 pawn but allows ...Nxa7\n- g3f5: Developing the knight but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e2g4: Bishop move that eyes the f7 square\n- g1g2: King safety move\n\n4. The most pressing issue is the knight fork on b4. We need to deal with this while maintaining our active rook.\n\nAfter considering these factors, the best move appears to be:\n\n```\na7a8\n```\n\nThis forces the exchange of rooks, eliminating the immediate threat from the knight fork. After Rxa8, we can then think about improving our position with moves like Kc1 or developing our pieces further. The material balance remains equal but we remove a dangerous attacker from the board."
