When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has king + bishop + pawns vs Black's king + knight + pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop controls important squares and can help promote the g-pawn\n- Black's knight is well-placed on e2, attacking White's pawn on d3\n- Black's king is centralized but needs to watch the g-pawn\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but can help defend\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: f5c8 looks tempting to control more squares, but might be too passive\n- King moves: b5c6 brings the king closer to the action and defends the d3 pawn\n- Pawn moves: pushing the g-pawn (g4) isn't possible yet, but we can prepare it\n\n4. Critical threats:\n- Black's knight can take the d3 pawn with Ne2xd3\n- Black's king can try to stop the g-pawn\n\n5. Best plan:\n- First defend the d3 pawn with the king\n- Then advance the g-pawn with king support\n- Use the bishop to control key squares\n\nAfter considering all options, the most solid move is to bring the king closer to defend the pawn while maintaining flexibility:\n\n```\nb5c6\n```"
