When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

But could support ...a5 or other play.\n- Seems passive.\n\n### 3. `d3d6` \u2013 Rook to d6, attacking the white rook on a4 via the open file?\n- Again, not a direct threat. White can just move the rook.\n\n### 4. `d3d5` \u2013 Rook to d5, centralizing\n- Active move. Could support ...e5 or ...c5.\n- Also eyes the white queen if she stays on e1.\n\n### 5. `d3d4` \u2013 Rook to d4, aggressive\n- Very active. Threatens to invade on the 4th rank.\n- Could lead to tactical ideas like Rd4+ or supporting ...e5.\n\n### 6. `a7a8` \u2013 Queen to a8, preparing to support ...a5\n- Quiet development. Might help push the a-pawn.\n\n### 7. `a7e3` \u2013 Queen to e3, threatening mate on g1\n- Tactical idea! Qe3 threatens Qxg1#.\n- Is this checkmate possible?\n\nLet\u2019s look at that closely.\n\n---\n\n## Tactical Line: `a7e3`\n\nAfter `a7e3`, White must respond to prevent Qxg1#.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is on h1. If Black plays `Qe3`, then:\n\n- `Qe3` threatens `Qxg1#`.\n- So White must play something like `Qf2` or `Rd1` to block or defend.\n\nBut let's see if we can do better than just threatening mate.\n\nWhat if we combine queen and rook?\n\n---\n\n## Best Move: `d3d4`\n\nThis move is very strong.\n\n- It activates the rook to the 4th rank.\n- It pressures the white queen on e1.\n- It supports potential central breaks like ...e5 or ...c5.\n- It also prepares to double rooks on the d-file if needed.\n- It doesn't allow White any easy counterplay.\n\nIt's active, flexible, and improves Black's position significantly.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n```\nd3d4\n```"
