When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and queens)\n2. Black has a knight on g4 attacking f2, but it's defended by our queen on f3\n3. Our bishop on b5 is very active, eyeing the c6 pawn and potentially the a6 square\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while our king is castled\n5. Black has a strong knight on c6 that's hard to dislodge\n\nKey observations:\n- The bishop on b5 is under attack by the pawn on d5\n- We have potential tactics involving the bishop and queen working together\n- We should consider developing our rooks or improving our piece coordination\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b5c6 - trading bishop for knight, but this relieves pressure on d5\n2. f4c7 - bishop sacrifice that looks tempting but may not be sound\n3. f3d5 - centralizing the queen while defending the bishop\n4. e1g1 - castling to safety\n5. a1d1 - connecting rooks\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f3d5 seems most principled, defending the bishop while centralizing the queen\n- It maintains our active piece play\n- It keeps options open for future attacks\n- It doesn't allow Black any counterplay\n\nOther moves either give up the bishop too easily or don't improve our position as much.\n\n```\nf3d5\n```"
