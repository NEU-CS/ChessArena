When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on e4 attacking f6 and g5\n- Black's bishop on h4 is very active, eyeing f2\n- White's queen on b3 is somewhat exposed\n- Black's king is exposed on c7\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxh4 winning the bishop\n- White could also play Nxf6+ winning the queen\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4g3: Bishop retreat, but allows Nxf6+ winning the queen\n- d7d8: Queen moves to defend, but allows Qxh4\n- g8g7: Rook moves to defend, but allows Qxh4\n- h4f2: Bishop sacrifice, but after Kxf2 Qxf2+ wins the queen back\n- d7e7: Queen moves to defend, but allows Qxh4\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be h4f2, sacrificing the bishop to force the queen trade. After:\n1... Bf2 2. Kxf2 Qxf2+ 3. Ke3 Qxg2\nBlack wins the queen back and maintains material equality while reducing White's attacking potential.\n\n```\nh4f2\n```"
