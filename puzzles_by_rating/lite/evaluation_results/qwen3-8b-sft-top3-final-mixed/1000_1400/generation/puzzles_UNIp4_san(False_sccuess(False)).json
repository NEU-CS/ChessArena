When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a pawn (White has Q+R+N vs Black's R+B+N), but White's queen is very active and threatening.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on h6 is eyeing the g7 pawn and potentially threatening mate on g7 if the knight moves\n- White has a discovered attack possibility with the rook on g3 if the knight moves\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5e8: Blocking the queen's diagonal and attacking the rook, but after Qxe8 Rxe8, White has Nxe5 winning material\n- f5g4: Attacking the queen, but Qxg4 Nxg4 and White is up a piece\n- d8e7: Blocking the queen's path to g7 while developing the queen, but White can play Qxg6\n- f5e4: Centralizing the bishop and defending g6, but allows Qxg6\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to protect g7 while maintaining piece activity\n- e5e8 seems forced, despite material loss, as it's the only way to prevent immediate mate threats\n\nAfter careful consideration, e5e8 is the most resilient move, forcing material exchanges and reducing White's attacking potential. Other moves either allow immediate mate or lose more material.\n\n```\ne5e8\n```"
