When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen on h6 is very active and threatening\n- White's queen on h4 is also active but needs to be careful about getting trapped\n- Black's bishop on d5 is controlling important squares\n- White's rook on e1 is currently passive\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black has potential threats like ...Qxh4 or ...Qf6+\n- White needs to address these while maintaining activity\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4d8: Queen sacrifice to win the rook, but after ...Rxd8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- h4e7: Blocking the bishop's diagonal and attacking the rook\n- e1e4: Activating the rook and defending f4 pawn\n- e5e6: Pushing the pawn to create threats\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h4e7 looks very strong as it blocks the bishop's diagonal and attacks the rook\n- After ...Rxe7, White can play Qxe7+ Kxe7 and then Re1-e4 with a strong position\n- Other moves either don't address the threats or don't improve White's position as much\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nh4e7\n```"
