When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized position with pieces well placed\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the h7 pawn advanced\n4. White has pressure on the d5 pawn and potential threats against Black's king\n5. Black's pieces are not optimally coordinated\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the immediate threats to d5 and potential king safety issues\n- Need to activate Black's pieces, especially the rooks\n- Need to find counterplay against White's strong center\n\nCandidate moves worth considering:\n1. d7e6 - Challenging White's center and opening lines for Black's pieces\n2. d8e8 - Connecting rooks and preparing to double on the e-file\n3. c6e5 - Directly challenging White's strong d5 pawn\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- d7e6 looks tempting but after dxe6 fxe6, White maintains strong control\n- d8e8 is solid but doesn't address the immediate center tension\n- c6e5 is the most active, directly challenging White's strongest pawn\n\nThe best move is c6e5, as it:\n- Directly challenges White's central pawn\n- Opens lines for Black's pieces\n- Creates potential counterplay\n- Maintains flexibility for Black's position\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
