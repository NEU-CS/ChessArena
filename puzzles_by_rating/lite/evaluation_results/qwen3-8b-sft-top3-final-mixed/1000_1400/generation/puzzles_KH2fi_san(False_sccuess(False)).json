When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Bishop, Knight vs Black's Rook, Knight, Pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on d6 is very active, attacking the black rook on e8\n- Black has a knight on d3 that's forking White's king and bishop on b3\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's knight on g3 is well placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6d8: Trading rooks would simplify into a roughly equal endgame, but we might lose our active rook\n- d6h6: Threatening the h7 pawn while keeping pressure on the rook\n- b3g8: Bishop sacrifice to open the h-file\n- g3h5: Knight move attacking the h7 pawn\n\n4. Critical line:\nAfter b3g8, if Rxg8 then h3h4 opens the h-file with threats against the black king. Black would have to play ...Kg7, but then h4h5 creates serious threats.\n\n5. Other moves:\n- d6d8 leads to rook trade and simplification\n- d6h6 is interesting but doesn't create immediate threats\n- g3h5 is solid but not as forcing\n\nThe bishop sacrifice b3g8 seems most promising as it opens the h-file against Black's exposed king while maintaining material balance. After Rxg8, h3h4 creates strong threats that Black will struggle to defend.\n\n```\nb3g8\n```"
