When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong bishop on c4 eyeing the f7 weakness\n4. Black has a bishop pair but their dark-squared bishop is very active on b3\n5. White's rook on h1 is well placed for potential kingside play\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) Bishop moves:\n- c4e6 looks tempting, attacking f7 and the rook on h8\n- c4a6 threatens the a7 pawn but seems less direct\n- c4d5 centralizes the bishop but doesn't create immediate threats\n\nB) Knight moves:\n- c3d5 looks interesting, attacking the bishop on b3 and eyeing f6\n- c3b5 could be considered but seems less active\n\nC) Rook moves:\n- h1h2 could prepare doubling rooks on the h-file\n- d1d7 looks very strong, threatening to invade the 7th rank\n\nAfter considering these options, d1d7 stands out as the most promising:\n- It threatens to invade the 7th rank with Rd7+\n- Black's king has limited escape squares (e7 is covered by the bishop on c4)\n- It maintains pressure on the f7 weakness\n- It coordinates well with the bishop on c4\n\nOther moves like c4e6 are also good, but d1d7 creates more immediate threats and forces Black to react defensively.\n\n```\nd1d7\n```"
