When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook, queen, bishop vs White's queen, rook, pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on a5 is very active, eyeing the b6 pawn and potentially threatening mate on g7\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's rook on b8 is passive\n- White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qb6+ next move, winning the b6 pawn or forcing the king to move\n- White could also play Qg5+ at some point, forcing the king to h8 and then Rf8 could be dangerous\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 - moves king away from potential checks but into a corner\n- b8b7 - activates the rook and defends b6 pawn\n- c7c6 - defends b6 pawn and connects rooks\n- f6g5 - blocks potential Qg5+ but leaves king exposed\n\nAfter considering these options, b8b7 seems most prudent because:\n- It activates the rook\n- Defends the b6 pawn against Qb6+\n- Keeps the king safe for now\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nOther moves either leave the king exposed or don't address the immediate threats.\n\n```\nb8b7\n```"
