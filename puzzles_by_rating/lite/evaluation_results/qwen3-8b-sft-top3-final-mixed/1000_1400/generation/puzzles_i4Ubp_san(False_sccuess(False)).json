When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n3. White has a strong bishop on e3 eyeing the h6 square\n4. Black's queen on e8 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n5. White's rook on d1 is well placed on an open file\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\n1. e3h6 - Bishop sacrifice to open up the king\n   - After ...gxh6, Qxh6+ Kg8 and White has strong attack with Qh6+ and Rg1+\n   - But Black might have ...Kf8 instead of taking, and the sacrifice isn't clear\n\n2. f2f6 - Queen sacrifice to open the g-file\n   - After ...gxf6, Rg1+ Kf8 and White has strong attack with Qf6+\n   - But Black might have ...Kf7 instead of taking\n\n3. d1d3 - Centralizing the rook\n   - Prepares to double rooks on the d-file or swing to g-file\n   - Solid but not immediately aggressive\n\n4. e3g5 - Bishop move threatening f6\n   - Puts pressure on f6 and maintains the strong diagonal\n   - Black would likely play ...h6 to defend\n\nAfter considering these, the most promising seems to be e3h6, sacrificing the bishop to open up Black's king. Even if Black doesn't take, the threat of Qxh6+ forces defensive moves that weaken Black's position.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ne3h6\n```"
