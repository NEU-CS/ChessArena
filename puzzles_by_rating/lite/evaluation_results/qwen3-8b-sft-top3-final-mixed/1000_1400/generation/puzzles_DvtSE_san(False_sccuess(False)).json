When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has pawns on e5, f4, g4 and king on b6\n3. White is to move\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e4f5 - King moves towards black's pawns\n2. e4e5 - King blocks the e-pawn\n3. e4d5 - King moves towards queenside\n4. e4d3 - King moves away from action\n5. c6c7 - Pushes the c-pawn\n6. a6a7 - Pushes the a-pawn\n\nAnalysis:\n- c6c7 looks tempting but after Kxc7, White's pawns are too slow\n- a6a7 is also premature as the pawn will be easily stopped\n- e4f5 seems best as it attacks the f4 pawn and prepares to support the kingside pawns\n- e4e5 blocks the e-pawn but allows black counterplay with f3\n- e4d5 moves away from the action on kingside\n\nThe best move is e4f5, attacking the f4 pawn and preparing to support White's own kingside pawns while keeping the king active.\n\n```\ne4f5\n```"
