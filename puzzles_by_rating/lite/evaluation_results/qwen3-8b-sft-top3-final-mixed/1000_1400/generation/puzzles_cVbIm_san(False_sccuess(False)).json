When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and pawns vs White's rook and pawns. Material is equal, but Black's king is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on f7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank\n- White's king is exposed on g3\n- Black has connected passed pawns on d4 and f5\n- White's rook on e2 is defending the e-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7f8: Rook lift to 8th rank, threatening to promote the a-pawn\n- f7h7: Rook swing to h-file, attacking h5 pawn\n- f6g6: King moves closer to center\n- d4d3: Pushing the passed pawn\n- h5h4: Pushing the h-pawn to create threats\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- f7f8 looks very strong as it threatens to promote the a-pawn (a7-a5-a4-a3-a2-a1=Q)\n- White can't stop both the a-pawn and the d/f pawns\n- Other moves don't create immediate threats\n- The rook lift to f8 also keeps the rook active and safe\n\n5. Potential responses:\n- If White tries Re2e7, Black can play a7a5 and the a-pawn will queen\n- If White plays Kg3h3, Black can push d4d3 with strong threats\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most forcing and winning move is to lift the rook to f8, creating an unstoppable passed pawn.\n\n```\nf7f8\n```"
