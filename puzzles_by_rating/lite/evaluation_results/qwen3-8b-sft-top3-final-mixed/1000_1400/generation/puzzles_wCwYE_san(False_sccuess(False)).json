When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except White is missing a knight)\n2. Black has a strong bishop pair and active pieces\n3. White's king is slightly exposed due to the open f-file\n4. Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n5. White has a space advantage in the center\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active, pinning the knight on f3\n- The bishop on g5 is unprotected but attacking f6\n- Black's knight on f6 is defending h7 and e4\n- White has potential to open the position with c4-c5\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5h6 - attacking the knight, but after ...Nxh6 White loses the bishop\n2. g5f6 - forcing ...gxf6 opens the g-file against Black's king\n3. c3d5 - centralizing the knight, but Black can play ...cxd5\n4. d1a4 - developing the queen with tempo on the bishop\n\nAfter considering these:\n- g5f6 seems most promising as it opens the g-file against Black's uncastled king\n- After 1. Bxf6 gxf6 2. Qd3, White can follow up with Qxg6+ or other threats\n- This maintains White's initiative and exploits Black's king position\n\nOther moves either don't create enough threats or allow Black to consolidate.\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
