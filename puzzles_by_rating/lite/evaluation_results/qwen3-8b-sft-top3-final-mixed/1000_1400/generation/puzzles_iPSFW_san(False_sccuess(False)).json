When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a rook on d2 attacking White's pawn on a2\n- White's knight on b4 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's knight on f4 is threatening to fork White's king and rook with Ne2+\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b4c6: Knight fork attacking rook and pawn, but after ...Rxc6 White loses material\n- b4d5: Centralizing the knight, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e1d3: Moving the king away from potential forks, but allows ...Rxa2\n- c1c2: Blocking the rook's attack on a2, but allows ...Ne2+ winning the rook\n- e5e6: Pushing the pawn to create threats, but doesn't address immediate issues\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1d3:\n- Gets the king to safety from potential forks\n- After ...Rxa2, White can play Nc2 attacking the rook\n- If Black doesn't take the pawn, White's king is safer\n- Other moves either lose material or leave the king vulnerable\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ne1d3\n```"
