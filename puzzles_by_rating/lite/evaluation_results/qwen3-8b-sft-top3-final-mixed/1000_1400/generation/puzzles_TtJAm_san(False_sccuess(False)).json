When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on d5 is very active, eyeing the d-file and potentially threatening to invade.\n- Black's knight on e4 is centralized and strong.\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on f1.\n- White's rooks are not well coordinated yet.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2e4: Capturing the knight, but after ...dxe4, Black's rook gets even more active.\n- f1g1: Moving the king to safety, but doesn't address the knight threat.\n- a1a2: Protecting the a3 pawn, but passive.\n- e2e3: Blocking the rook's path and attacking the knight. This seems most promising.\n\n4. After e2e3:\n- If ...Nxe3, then Rxe3 and White's rooks become active.\n- If ...Nf6, then White can consider doubling rooks on the e-file.\n- If ...dxe3, then Rxe3 and White has active play.\n\n5. Other moves like f2f4 or g2g4 would weaken White's pawn structure without clear compensation.\n\nThe most principled move is e2e3, challenging Black's strong knight and improving White's piece coordination. It maintains tension while addressing the most pressing threat.\n\n```\ne2e3\n```"
