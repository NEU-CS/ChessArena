When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and rooks)\n2. Black has a strong bishop pair and active pieces\n3. White's king is slightly exposed due to pawn structure\n4. Black's queen on c7 is eyeing the c2 pawn\n5. White's knight on g3 is well placed but could be more active\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's bishop on e6 is very strong, controlling important diagonals\n- White's bishop on e2 is blocked by its own pawn on c2\n- The f3 knight could jump to g5 to attack the bishop on e6\n- The f2 queen could potentially go after the weak d5 pawn or support an attack\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f3g5 - attacks the bishop on e6, but after ...Bxg5 White loses a knight\n2. f2d4 - centralizes the queen and attacks d5 pawn, but allows ...Bxd4\n3. e2c4 - develops the bishop and attacks d5 pawn, but allows ...Bxc4\n4. f2c5 - pins the c7 queen to the king, but Black can defend with ...Qxc5\n\nAfter considering these, the most promising seems to be f2c5:\n- Creates an immediate threat to the queen\n- If Black takes with ...Qxc5, White can play bxc6 opening lines\n- If Black moves the queen, White gains tempo\n- Maintains pressure on d5 pawn\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't create enough threats. The pin on the c-file is very uncomfortable for Black.\n\n```\nf2c5\n```"
