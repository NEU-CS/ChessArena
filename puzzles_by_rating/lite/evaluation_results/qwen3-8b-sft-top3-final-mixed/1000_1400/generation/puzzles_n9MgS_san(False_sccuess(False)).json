When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 3 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White has a slight advantage with the bishop pair\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's queen is very active on h3, threatening mate on g2\n   - White's king is exposed on f1\n   - Black's knight on f4 is well placed\n   - White's rook on a7 is active but not immediately threatening\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - f1g1: Moves king towards the corner, but allows Qxg2#\n   - f1e1: Moves king away from danger, but still leaves Qxg2 threat\n   - e4g2: Captures the queen with the bishop, eliminating the immediate threat\n\n4. The best move is clearly e4g2:\n   - It removes Black's dangerous queen\n   - After Bxg2, White can play Qxh3, winning the queen back\n   - This leads to a roughly equal endgame where White's bishop pair might be decisive\n\nThe other moves would lead to immediate loss or worse positions, while e4g2 is forcing and eliminates Black's main threat.\n\n```\ne4g2\n```"
