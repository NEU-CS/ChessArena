When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's king is more exposed.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is on h5, very exposed with Black's queen on h1 and rook on f8\n- Black's king is on h7, relatively safe\n- White has a passed pawn on e5, but it's blockaded by Black's f5 pawn\n- Black's c5 pawn is under attack by White's b3 pawn\n\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxh1 winning the queen\n- White also has potential mating threats with the rook on e4\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h1e4: Queen takes rook, but after Qxe4 White has Qxh1\n- h1f3: Defends against Qxh1, but allows White to push e6\n- f8f7: Covers h7 square, but doesn't address Qxh1\n- h7g7: King moves away from potential checks\n- f5e4: Pawn takes rook, but after fxe4 Qxh1\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to sacrifice the queen to eliminate White's dangerous rook and maintain material equality while keeping the initiative:\n\n```\nh1e4\n```\n\nThis forces Qxe4, after which we can play Qxh1, and while we lose the queen, we eliminate White's active rook and maintain a balanced position with chances to push our pawns. Other moves either lose material immediately or allow White to maintain too much activity."
