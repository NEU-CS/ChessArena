When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. White has a strong centralized queen on b3 and active pieces\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. White has a passed pawn on d5 that could become dangerous\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\nKey observations:\n- White's queen on b3 is eyeing the f7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- Black's rook on a8 is inactive\n- The bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on d7\n- White's pawn on d5 is cramping Black's position\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e6f5 - Bishop moves to attack the queen, but after Qxf5 we lose material\n2. c7e5 - Queen moves to challenge the center, but dxe5 opens the position\n3. g8f8 - King moves to safety, but allows White to push d6\n4. a8e8 - Rook activates to defend e7, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\nBest move seems to be e6f5, forcing the queen trade:\n- After Qxf5, we can play Qxf5 and our king becomes safer\n- We eliminate White's strong queen\n- We open the e-file for our rook\n- We maintain control over key squares\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. While e6f5 gives up the bishop pair, it's necessary to defuse White's attacking potential.\n\n```\ne6f5\n```"
