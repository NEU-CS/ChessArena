When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight, queen and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a very active queen on f2 attacking the bishop on g2\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning the knight on e3 to the king\n- White's rook on b6 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black has threats like ...Qxg2 or ...Bxe3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6b8: Rook retreat to safety but gives up pressure\n- e3f5: Breaking the pin but allowing ...Qxg2\n- g2d5: Blocking with the bishop but allows ...Qxd5\n- d1a4: Queen moves to defend g2 but allows ...Bxe3\n- c1d2: Blocking the pin but allows ...Qxg2+\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\nWe need to protect the bishop on g2 while maintaining activity. The move g2d5 seems most promising because:\n- It blocks the pin on the knight\n- If ...Qxd5, we can recapture with exd5\n- It maintains pressure on Black's position\n- It keeps our pieces active\n\nOther moves either lose material or give up too much activity. While g2d5 does allow ...Qxd5, we get good compensation with the pawn on d5.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is:\n\n```\ng2d5\n```"
