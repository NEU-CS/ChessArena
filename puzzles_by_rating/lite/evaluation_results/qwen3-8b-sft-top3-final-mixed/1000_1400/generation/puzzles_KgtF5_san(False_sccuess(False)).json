When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, 2 bishops, rook, pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very active, eyeing g7 and f6 squares\n- Black's queen on f2 is threatening White's rook on h1\n- Black has a rook on f3 attacking White's bishop on e4\n- White's king is exposed on c1\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5g7: Queen sacrifice to remove Black's bishop, but after ...Kxg7 White's position remains difficult\n- e5f6: Attacks the bishop on g6, but Black can defend with ...Qxf6\n- d5f7: Bishop sacrifice to open the king, but after ...Kxf7 White's attack may not be enough\n- h1h6: Rook move to attack the bishop on g6, but Black can defend with ...Qxh6\n- e4f5: Bishop move to attack the rook on f3, but after ...Qxf5 White loses material\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5g7:\n- Forces the bishop to take: ...Bxg7\n- Then Qxg7+ Kxg7\n- Now White can play Rh7+ with a strong attack against the exposed king\n- Even if Black finds ...Kf8, White has Rxf7 with a winning attack\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and promising continuation, creating immediate threats against Black's king while maintaining material equality.\n\n```\ne5g7\n```"
