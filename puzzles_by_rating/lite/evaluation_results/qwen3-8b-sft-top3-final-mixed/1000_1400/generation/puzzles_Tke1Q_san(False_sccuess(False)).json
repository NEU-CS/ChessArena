When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black has a strong bishop pair and active pieces, but their king is slightly exposed\n3. White's queen on g4 is very active, eyeing the black king\n4. Black's queen on f6 is defending key squares\n5. White has a passed pawn on d5 that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's king is on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White's queen can potentially deliver checks or create threats against the black king\n- The bishop on e3 is well-placed, controlling important diagonals\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g4g6 - Queen sacrifice to open the king\n2. e3g5 - Bishop sacrifice to open the king\n3. c3b5 - Knight move attacking the queen\n4. d5d6 - Pushing the passed pawn\n\nAfter deep consideration:\n- g4g6 looks tempting but after Qxg6 hxg6, Black's king is still relatively safe\n- e3g5 is interesting but after Qxg5 hxg5, White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- c3b5 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- d5d6 is the most forcing move, creating a dangerous passed pawn that Black must deal with\n\nThe best move is to push the passed pawn, as it creates immediate threats and forces Black to react. The pawn on d6 will be very difficult to stop from advancing further.\n\n```\nd5d6\n```"
