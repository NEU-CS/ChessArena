When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized knight on e5 and bishop pair\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White's pieces are more active and coordinated\n5. Black's queen on d6 is under attack by White's bishop on c4\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the threat to the queen\n- Need to improve king safety\n- Need to activate Black's pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. d6d8 - Queen retreats to defend, but blocks the rook\n2. d6e7 - Queen moves to safer square, but blocks bishop\n3. f6e8 - Knight blocks queen's retreat, but seems passive\n4. g8h8 - King moves to safer square, but doesn't address queen\n5. f8e8 - Rook defends queen, but allows White to play Bxe5\n\nBest option seems to be d6e7:\n- Gets the queen to safety\n- Doesn't block any pieces\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Prepares to possibly double rooks on the e-file later\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen threat or create new weaknesses. While d6e7 does block the bishop, the bishop can always retreat later if needed.\n\n```\nd6e7\n```"
