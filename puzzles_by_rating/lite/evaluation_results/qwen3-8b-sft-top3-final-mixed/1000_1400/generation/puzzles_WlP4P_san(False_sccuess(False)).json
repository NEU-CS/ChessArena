When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed and under pressure from White's rook on f2\n3. Black has a rook on c2 that's trapped by its own pawn on b5\n4. White's queen on f5 is very active and threatening\n5. Black's queen on e2 is under attack from White's bishop on g2\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e2h5 - Queen moves to h5, attacking the bishop and potentially threatening mate\n2. e2g4 - Queen moves to g4, attacking the f3 pawn and eyeing the king\n3. c2c8 - Trying to save the trapped rook\n4. h4g3 - Pawn takes bishop, but opens up the king further\n\nAfter deep consideration:\n- e2h5 looks tempting but after Qxh5, White can play Qxh5 and we lose material\n- e2g4 is better, threatening Qxf3+ and keeping the queen active\n- c2c8 is too slow and doesn't address the immediate threats\n- h4g3 is too risky as it opens the king\n\nThe best move is e2g4, maintaining queen activity and creating threats against White's king while keeping options to defend.\n\n```\ne2g4\n```"
