When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and queen vs Black's rook, bishop and queen. Material is roughly equal, but White has a slight positional advantage due to better piece coordination.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on c5 is very active, attacking the black queen on g5\n- Black's queen is under attack and must move or be defended\n- White's queen on f2 is well placed, eyeing the f7 pawn\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5f8: Bishop takes rook with check, but after ...Kxf8 White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- c5e7: Bishop takes pawn, but this seems passive\n- f2f7: Queen takes pawn with check, forcing the king to move\n- b1h7: Knight move threatening mate on f8, but Black can defend with ...Qg6\n\n4. Best move appears to be f2f7+:\n- Forces the king to move (only legal reply is ...Kxf7)\n- Then White can play Bxg5, winning the queen\n- Even if Black tries ...Ke8 after f2f7+, White has Bxg5 with a strong attack\n\nOther moves either don't capitalize on the immediate opportunity or allow Black to maintain equality. The f2f7+ sequence leads to a clear material advantage.\n\n```\nf2f7\n```"
