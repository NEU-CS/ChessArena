When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on b2 is eyeing the b7 pawn\n- White's bishop on c3 is pinning the d5 knight to the king\n- White has potential threats like Qb2-b7 or Qb2-d4\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has potential mating threats with rook and queen coordination\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Blocking the pin and attacking the bishop\n- d8g8: Getting the rook to defend the king\n- g4g6: Moving the queen to a safer square\n- h8g8: Moving the king to a safer square\n\nAfter considering these options, d5e7 seems most promising because:\n- It blocks the dangerous pin on the d5 knight\n- It attacks White's bishop on c3\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It doesn't allow White any immediate counterplay\n\nOther moves like d8g8 would leave the knight pinned, and king moves would be too passive. The queen moves don't address the immediate threats.\n\n```\nd5e7\n```"
