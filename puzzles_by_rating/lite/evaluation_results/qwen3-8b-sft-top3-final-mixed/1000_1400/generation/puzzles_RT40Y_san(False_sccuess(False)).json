When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e4\n- Black has a rook on f1 controlling the f-file\n- Black's knight on a4 is well placed\n- White has a passed pawn on b5\n- Black's rook on a7 is active\n\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to play Rxa7 winning the rook\n- White also has potential threats against the black king\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7a8: Protects the rook but allows White to push b6\n- a4c3: Attacks the bishop and creates threats against White's king\n- f1f4: Direct attack on White's king\n- h6h5: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\nAfter considering these options, a4c3 seems most promising because:\n- It attacks White's bishop\n- It creates potential discovered checks against White's king\n- It maintains pressure while defending against immediate threats\n- It keeps the initiative\n\nOther moves either allow White to gain material or don't address the immediate threats as effectively.\n\n```\na4c3\n```"
