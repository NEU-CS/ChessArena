When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is somewhat exposed on e3\n4. Black has connected passed pawns on the queenside (a6, b5, c5)\n5. White has a passed pawn on e4, but it's blockaded by Black's king\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to activate White's king to help stop Black's queenside pawns\n- Need to create counterplay against Black's king\n- Need to be careful about allowing Black's king to penetrate further\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e3d3 - King moves toward queenside pawns, but allows Black's king to penetrate via f5\n2. e3e2 - Retreats king but doesn't make progress\n3. e4e5 - Pushes passed pawn, but Black can simply take with fxe5\n4. f3f4 - Creates a passed pawn on f-file, but Black can respond with ...Kf5\n5. c3c4 - Challenges Black's queenside pawns, but after ...bxc4, White's king is still passive\n\nBest move seems to be e3d3, activating the king toward the queenside pawns. While it allows ...Kf5, White can then play Kc3 to challenge the pawns. This is the most active plan to create counterplay.\n\n```\ne3d3\n```"
