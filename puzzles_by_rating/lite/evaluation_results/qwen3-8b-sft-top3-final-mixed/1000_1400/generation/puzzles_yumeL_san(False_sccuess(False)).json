When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's knight on c5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on e5\n- White has passed pawns on d3 and h4\n- Black has pawns on c6, g6, h5\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Nxe6+ winning the pawn\n- White could push d4-d5 opening lines\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5f6: King moves away from center but exposes to checks\n- e5d6: King moves toward pawns but still exposed\n- a5d8: Bishop retreats but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g6g5: Pushes pawn but weakens king position\n- f5f4: Pushes pawn but blocks bishop\n\n5. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to prevent Nxe6+ while keeping king safe\n- e5d6 seems most resilient, moving king toward pawns and away from knight's reach\n\nAfter considering all options, e5d6 is the most solid move, keeping the king active while avoiding immediate threats.\n\n```\ne5d6\n```"
