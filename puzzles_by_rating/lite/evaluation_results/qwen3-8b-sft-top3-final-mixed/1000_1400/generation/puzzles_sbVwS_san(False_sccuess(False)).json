When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. White has a strong centralized knight on f4 and active pieces\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. White has potential threats against the black king (like Qh5+ ideas)\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the king safety issue\n- Need to activate the rooks\n- Need to deal with White's central control\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g8h8 - moves king to corner but still vulnerable\n2. e8e7 - connects rooks but blocks the bishop\n3. e6f5 - trades the strong bishop but opens the e-file\n4. c5d4 - challenges White's center but may not be best\n5. a8d8 - centralizes the rook and prepares to double on the d-file\n\nAfter considering these, a8d8 seems most promising because:\n- Centralizes the rook\n- Prepares to double rooks on the d-file\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Maintains flexibility for other pieces\n- Helps coordinate the rooks for potential counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new problems. For example, moving the king to h8 leaves it very passive, and e6f5 gives up a strong bishop for limited compensation.\n\n```\na8d8\n```"
