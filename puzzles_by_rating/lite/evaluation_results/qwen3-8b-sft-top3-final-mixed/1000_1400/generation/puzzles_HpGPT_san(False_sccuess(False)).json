When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, queen, rook and pawns vs Black's queen, two bishops, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on g3 is very active, eyeing the black king's position\n- Black's knight on f4 is threatening to fork with Ne2+\n- White's bishop on f5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5h7: Bishop sacrifice to open the king\n- g3h4: Queen move threatening mate on h7\n- e3g4: Knight move attacking the knight on f4\n- d1d8: Rook lift to attack the queen\n\n4. Calculating f5h7:\n- f5h7 g8h8 (only move)\n- Then g3h4! threatening mate on h7\n- Black can't stop both threats (queen and rook)\n\n5. Calculating g3h4 immediately:\n- Black can defend with g7h6\n- Then we'd need to find another way to exploit the exposed king\n\n6. Calculating e3g4:\n- Attacks the knight but allows Ne2+ forking king and queen\n\nAfter careful consideration, f5h7 is the most forcing and decisive move, leading to mate or massive material gain. The bishop sacrifice opens the black king's position perfectly.\n\n```\nf5h7\n```"
