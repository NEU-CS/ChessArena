When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d5 is very strong, eyeing the black king on h8\n- Black's rook on f3 is very active, threatening White's rook on f1\n- White's knight on e6 is well-placed but needs to be careful about getting trapped\n- Black's bishop on g6 is pinning White's pawn on h3 to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6f8: Knight sacrifice to remove the defender of h8\n- d5d8: Queen sacrifice to remove the defender of h8\n- d5h5: Queen move attacking the bishop and threatening mate\n- f1g1: Moving the rook out of attack\n\n4. Deep analysis:\n- e6f8 looks tempting: after Kxf8, Qxh5+ wins the bishop, but then Rxf8+ and White is up material\n- d5d8 is also interesting: Qxd8 Rxd8, then Nf8+ wins the rook\n- d5h5 is strong: attacking the bishop and threatening Qxh7# if the bishop moves\n- Black's best reply to d5h5 would be Bf7, but then Qxh7+ Kg8 Qxg7+ wins material\n\nAfter considering all options, d5h5 seems the most forcing and decisive move, creating immediate threats that Black cannot easily parry.\n\n```\nd5h5\n```"
