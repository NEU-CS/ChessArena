When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on c8 is very active, controlling the 8th rank\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's bishop on f3 is blocked by its own pawn on e5\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rc8-c7, attacking the g7 rook\n- White could also play Rc8-g8+, winning the rook\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: Gets the king away from potential checks but leaves the rook hanging\n- g7h7: Protects the rook but allows Rc8-c7\n- f3h5: Develops the bishop but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f3g4: Blocks the g-file but allows Rc8-g8+\n- b7b6: Doesn't address the main problems\n\n5. Best move seems to be g7f7:\n- Protects the rook from Rc8-c7\n- Keeps the rook defended by the king\n- Maintains control of the g-file\n- Prepares to possibly bring the king to f7 for safety\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. While g7f7 does block the bishop's diagonal, it's a necessary sacrifice to maintain material equality.\n\n```\ng7f7\n```"
