When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and rooks)\n2. Black has a knight on a6 that's not doing much\n3. White has a strong bishop on c4 eyeing the f7 pawn\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the pawn structure\n5. White has a passed pawn on e3 that could become dangerous\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) c4f7 - Bishop sacrifice to open the king\n   - After Kxf7, Nc7+ forks king and rook\n   - But black can play Ke8 instead of taking the bishop\n   - Not clearly winning\n\nB) b5c7 - Knight fork attacking rook and bishop\n   - After Rxc7, Bxc7 leaves white with bishop pair\n   - But black gets the rook for the knight\n\nC) c3d5 - Centralizing the knight\n   - Threatens to go to e7 or f6\n   - But black can defend with ...Nxd5\n\nD) e3e4 - Pushing the passed pawn\n   - Creates a dangerous passed pawn\n   - Opens lines for the rooks\n   - Black can't easily stop both the pawn and the bishop's diagonal\n\nAfter considering these options, e3e4 seems most promising because:\n1) It creates a passed pawn that will be hard to stop\n2) It opens the e-file for the rooks\n3) It maintains all of white's positional advantages\n4) Black has no immediate way to punish this move\n\nThe pawn push is more forcing than the tactical shots which can be easily defended against.\n\n```\ne3e4\n```"
