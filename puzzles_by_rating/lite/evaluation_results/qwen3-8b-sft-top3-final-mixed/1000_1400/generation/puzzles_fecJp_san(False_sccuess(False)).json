When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance and piece placement:\n- White has a queen on h5, bishop on c4, knight on g6, and rook on a1\n- Black has a king on e7, bishop on f8, knight on c6, and pawns on d5, d4, f6, h7\n- White's queen and knight are very active, creating threats\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on h5 is attacking the h7 pawn (which is only defended by the king)\n- White's knight on g6 is forking the king and rook (if the king moves)\n- Black's king is exposed in the center\n- White has a strong bishop on c4 eyeing the f7 square\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- e7e8: King moves to e8 - but then Qxh7 is mate\n- e7f7: King moves to f7 - but then Qxf6+ wins material\n- e7d7: King moves to d7 - but then Qxh7 is still possible\n- e7e6: King moves to e6 - but then Qxh7 is mate\n- e7d6: King moves to d6 - but then Qxh7 is mate\n- h7g6: Pawn takes knight - this seems forced to avoid immediate mate\n\n4. The only move that doesn't lose immediately is h7g6, capturing the knight. After this:\n- White can play Qxh7, but then Black has Bxh7 and is down a pawn but has eliminated the immediate threats\n- Other moves all lead to immediate checkmate\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh7g6\n```"
