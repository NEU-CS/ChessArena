When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If Black moves the rook, White may capture it with check.\n- However, if Black plays ...Qxg7, then White loses the knight and opens up the h-file for potential attack.\n- Also, note that after ...Qxg7, the white king is still in danger due to the open h-file and Black\u2019s active pieces.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nLet\u2019s evaluate some of the most promising options:\n\n#### 1. `g5g7` (Queen takes knight)\n- Removes the dangerous knight on g7.\n- Opens the h-file for Black\u2019s rook on h8.\n- After this, White must respond carefully; otherwise, Black can follow up with Rh1+ or Qh6+ ideas.\n- This seems like a strong tactical choice.\n\n#### 2. `g8h8` (King to h8)\n- Avoids potential checks from the knight on g7.\n- But passive and doesn't take advantage of the hanging knight.\n\n#### 3. `e6g4` (Bishop to g4)\n- Attacks the queen on g5.\n- Might lead to exchanges that simplify the position.\n- Less aggressive than taking the knight.\n\n#### 4. `g5f5` (Queen to f5)\n- Pressures the white king along the diagonal and file.\n- Could prepare for a mating net.\n- Still leaves the knight on g7 hanging.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move here is:\n\n```\ng5g7\n```\n\nThis captures the hanging knight, opens the h-file, and puts pressure on the white king. It leads to immediate tactical complications where Black can continue with Rh1+ or Qh6+ depending on White's reply.\n\n---\n\n```\ng5g7\n```"
