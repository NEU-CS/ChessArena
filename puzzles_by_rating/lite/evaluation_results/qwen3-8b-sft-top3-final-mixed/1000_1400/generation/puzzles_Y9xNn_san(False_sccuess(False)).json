When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h6.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on f2, attacking White's rook on h1 and threatening mate on f1\n- White's queen is centralized on c4, but needs to be careful about Black's rooks\n- White's h-pawn is a potential asset if it can queen\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black threatens Qxh1 winning the rook\n- Black also has potential discovered checks with the e7 rook\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c4g8: Queen sacrifice to remove the h8 king's escape\n- c4f7: Blocking the f-file and attacking the e7 rook\n- h1h5: Moving the rook away from attack\n- d1g1: Blocking the queen's attack on the rook\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c4g8 looks tempting as a sacrifice, but after ...Rxg8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- c4f7 is interesting, but after ...Rxf7 White's position remains difficult\n- h1h5 seems safest, getting the rook out of attack while maintaining pressure\n\nThe best move is to get the rook out of attack while keeping all options open. h1h5 accomplishes this while also potentially preparing to double rooks on the h-file later.\n\n```\nh1h5\n```"
