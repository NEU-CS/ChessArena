When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on h7\n- White has a strong bishop on b3 pointing at Black's kingside\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on e4\n- White's queen is well placed on c2, eyeing the c7 pawn\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...e4-e3, opening lines against White's king\n- Black's bishop on g3 is very active, pinning White's f2 pawn to the king\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d3e5: Centralizing the knight, attacking f7\n- b3c5: Developing the bishop with tempo on the rook\n- c2c7: Attacking the rook and threatening to win material\n- g2h3: Challenging Black's bishop and opening the g-file\n\nAfter deep consideration:\n- d3e5 looks tempting but allows ...e4-e3 with counterplay\n- b3c5 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- c2c7 is very strong, winning the exchange after ...Rxc7 Bxc7\n- g2h3 is risky as it opens lines for Black's pieces\n\nThe most forcing and advantageous move is c2c7, winning material while maintaining the initiative. Black's best response would be ...Rxc7, but then Bxc7 leaves White with a clear material advantage and better piece coordination.\n\n```\nc2c7\n```"
