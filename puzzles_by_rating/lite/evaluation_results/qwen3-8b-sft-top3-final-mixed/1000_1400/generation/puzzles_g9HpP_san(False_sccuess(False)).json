When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1 with Black's queen on h3 eyeing it\n3. Threats: Black has a strong threat of Qxg2# if White doesn't defend\n4. Piece activity: Black's pieces are more active, especially the queen and bishop pair\n5. Weaknesses: White's f2 pawn is pinned and could be a target\n\nThe most urgent issue is defending against Qxg2#. Let's evaluate candidate moves:\n\n1. g1f2 - moves the king away but leaves the f2 pawn hanging\n2. e1g2 - blocks with the rook but allows Qxg2+ followed by Qxg2#\n3. e2g4 - blocks with bishop but allows Qxg4\n4. e2f3 - blocks with bishop, seems best as it maintains material\n5. f1f2 - blocks with rook but allows Qxg2+ followed by Qxg2#\n\nAfter careful consideration, e2f3 is the only move that both defends against mate and maintains material equality. Other moves either allow mate or lose material.\n\n```\ne2f3\n```"
