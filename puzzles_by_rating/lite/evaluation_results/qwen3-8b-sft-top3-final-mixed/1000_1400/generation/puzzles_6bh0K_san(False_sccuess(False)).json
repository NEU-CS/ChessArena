When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight on h8, bishop on g2, queen on d2, rook on b1, pawns on d5, e4, g4, c3, a2. Black has queen on a6, rook on c8, knight on g2, pawns on a7, b7, c6, f6, g7, h7. Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on h8 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's knight on g2 is threatening White's king\n- White's queen is well placed on d2\n- Black's queen on a6 is eyeing the a2 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8f7: Knight moves to f7, attacking the rook on c8\n- d2h6: Queen moves to h6, attacking the knight on g2\n- b1b7: Rook moves to b7, attacking the queen on a6\n- g2f3: Bishop moves to f3, blocking the knight's attack on the king\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- h8f7 looks tempting as it attacks the rook, but after ...Rxf7 White loses the knight\n- d2h6 is strong as it attacks the knight on g2 while also threatening mate on h7\n- b1b7 is also good, forcing the queen to move and winning time\n- g2f3 is too passive and allows Black to maintain pressure\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be d2h6, attacking the knight while maintaining threats against Black's position. Black will have to respond to the knight threat, giving White the initiative.\n\n```\nd2h6\n```"
