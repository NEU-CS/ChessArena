When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

However, White's bishop on d6 is very strong, controlling key squares.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8 with White's rook on e5 eyeing the e-file. White also has a passed pawn on d5 that could become dangerous.\n\n3. Immediate threats: White has Qd1-h5+ coming, which would be devastating. Black must address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 - moves king away from potential checks\n- c8h3 - develops bishop with tempo against the queen\n- c6e8 - blocks the h5+ threat by pinning the queen to the king\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- g8h8 is too passive and doesn't address the immediate threat\n- c8h3 is interesting but White can simply move the queen\n- c6e8 is the most forcing move, creating a pin that White must deal with\n\nThe best move is c6e8, which:\n- Blocks the deadly h5+ threat\n- Pins White's queen to the king\n- Maintains material equality\n- Keeps Black's pieces active\n\n```\nc6e8\n```"
