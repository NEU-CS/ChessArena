When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong pawn center with f5 and e4 pawns\n3. Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n4. White's pieces are more active - bishop on f4 is very strong, queen on f3 is centralized\n5. Black's bishop on c5 is blocked by its own pawn on d7\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the immediate threats: White could play Qf3-f5+ next move, attacking the king\n- Need to develop the position and get the king to safety\n- The bishop on c5 is very strong but needs to be protected\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g8h8 (castling) - but this leaves the king exposed to potential attacks\n2. f8f7 - blocks the f-file but doesn't solve the king safety issue\n3. e7g6 - develops the knight but blocks the bishop\n4. c5d6 - moves the bishop but loses control of f4\n5. c6e5 - knight move attacking f3 queen, but after Qxe5 we lose material\n\nBest move seems to be e7g6:\n- Develops the knight to a good square\n- Blocks the f-file from White's queen\n- Prepares to castle by moving the king to g8\n- Maintains control over f4 square\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new problems. While castling is tempting, it's better to first develop the knight to g6 which is a more active square and helps with king safety.\n\n```\ne7g6\n```"
