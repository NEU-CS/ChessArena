When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is on h5, Black's king on e5\n- White has a passed pawn on h4, Black has a passed pawn on f6\n- Black's rook is very active on d4, controlling key squares\n\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to push h4-h5, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- Black needs to either stop this pawn or create counterplay\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5f5: King moves toward White's pawn, but allows h4-h5\n- d4h4: Capturing the pawn immediately, but after Rxh4 Kxh4, White's king can stop Black's pawn\n- d4g4: Pins the pawn to the king, preventing h4-h5\n- f6f5: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address the h-pawn threat\n\n5. Best move seems d4g4:\n- Pins the h4 pawn to the king\n- Prevents h4-h5 advance\n- Maintains rook's activity\n- If White takes (Rxg4), Kxg4 and Black's king can stop the h-pawn while pushing f6-f5\n\nOther moves either allow White's pawn to advance or don't address the immediate threat. The pin is the most forcing and restrictive move.\n\n```\nd4g4\n```"
