When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, queen, rook, and pawns vs Black's knight, bishop, rook, queen, and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active, attacking f7 and pinning the knight on d7 to the king.\n- Black's queen on g3 is threatening mate on g2 (Qxg2#).\n- White's rook on f4 is also active, eyeing the f-file.\n- Black's king is exposed on c8.\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's Qg3 is threatening mate, so we must address this first.\n- Our queen on e6 is very powerful and can create threats against Black's king.\n\n4. Candidate moves to stop Qg3:\n- g2c6 blocks the queen's path to g2 while developing the bishop\n- e6e1+ forces the king to move and unloads the pin\n- f4f1+ is a discovered check that also stops the mate threat\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- g2c6 looks tempting but after ...Qxc6, we lose material\n- e6e1+ Kd8 and the mate threat remains\n- f4f1+ is the most forcing move, as it:\n  * Gives check\n  * Stops the mate threat\n  * Opens the f-file for our rook\n  * After Kd8, we have Qxf7+ winning material\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf4f1\n```"
