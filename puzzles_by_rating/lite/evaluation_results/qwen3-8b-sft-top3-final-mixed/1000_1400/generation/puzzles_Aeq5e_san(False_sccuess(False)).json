When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong centralized queen on b4 attacking our rook on d1\n3. Black has connected passed pawns on the queenside (a5 and d5)\n4. Our king is somewhat exposed with black's rook on e8 eyeing the e-file\n5. We have a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's queen is very active and threatening our rook\n- We need to deal with the immediate threat to our rook on d1\n- We have several ways to defend the rook:\n  * Move the rook (a1a5 looks tempting to challenge black's a-pawn)\n  * Block with our bishop (b3d5 looks interesting)\n  * Move the queen (d3b5 defends the rook while attacking black's queen)\n\nAfter considering:\n- a1a5 allows black to play b4b2 with a discovered attack on our rook\n- b3d5 is met with b4xd5 winning a piece\n- d3b5 seems best as it defends the rook while attacking black's queen, forcing it to move\n\nOther candidate moves like d3g6 or b3c4 don't address the immediate threat to our rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd3b5\n```"
