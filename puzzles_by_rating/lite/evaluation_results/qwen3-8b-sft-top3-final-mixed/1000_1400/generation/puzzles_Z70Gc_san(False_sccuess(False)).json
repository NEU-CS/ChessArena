When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has bishop pair, White has queen and bishop pair). Black's king is slightly exposed.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong pawn center with d4 and e6 pawns\n- Black's queen is very active on g3, attacking f2 and threatening mate on g2\n- Black's bishop on g6 is pinned to the king by White's queen on e2\n- White's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Qg2# if the bishop moves\n- White has potential threats like Bxg6 or Qxg6\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3g2: Immediate mate threat, but White can play Kxg2\n- g3f2: Attacks the rook and threatens mate, but White can defend\n- g6h7: Unpins the bishop and threatens Qxh7, but White can play Qxh7\n- g6f7: Blocks the queen's path to g2, but allows White to develop\n- h5g4: Creates luft for the king, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to block the queen's path to g2 while maintaining pressure:\n\n```\ng6f7\n```\n\nThis move:\n- Blocks the queen's path to g2\n- Maintains the pin on the f7 pawn\n- Keeps the bishop active\n- Doesn't allow White to easily exploit the pin\n- Prepares potential ...Qxf2+ ideas later\n\nOther moves either allow immediate mate or lose material. This is the most resilient option that maintains Black's active pieces while addressing the immediate threats."
