When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop, knight vs Black's queen, bishop, pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on e1, threatening multiple things\n- White's rook on h7 is very active, pinning the f7 pawn to the king\n- White's knight on g5 is well placed but needs to be careful about forks\n- Black's bishop on c6 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g5e4: Knight moves to e4, attacking the bishop on c6 and threatening forks\n- g5f3: Knight moves to f3, defending the g5 square and preparing to jump to d4\n- f2f3: Pawn move, but seems passive and doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black's queen could play Qe1-e3+ next move, forking king and rook\n- Need to prevent this while maintaining initiative\n\nAfter considering:\n- g5e4 is the most active move, attacking the bishop and preparing potential forks (like Nxc5 or Nf6+)\n- It also prevents Qe3+ as the knight would defend the king\n- f2f3 is too passive and allows Black to consolidate\n- g5f3 is okay but doesn't create immediate threats\n\nThe best move is:\n```\ng5e4\n```"
