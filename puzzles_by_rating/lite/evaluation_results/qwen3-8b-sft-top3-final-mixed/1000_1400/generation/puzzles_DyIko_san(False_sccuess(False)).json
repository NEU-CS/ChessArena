When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a passed pawn on d7 and another pawn on c5. Black has a rook on d1 and a pawn on f3. White's king is on b3, black's king is on g4.\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's d7 pawn is one move away from promotion\n- Black's rook is currently blocking the d-file but can be captured\n- Black's f3 pawn is threatening to promote soon\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but can help stop the f-pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7d8q (promoting immediately)\n- h4g5 (king moves to attack f3 pawn)\n- c5c6 (advancing the c-pawn)\n- h4f6 (king moves to support d-pawn)\n\n4. Analysis of d7d8q:\n- After d7d8q, black can play f3f2 and promote next move\n- White would have to play qd8f2 to stop promotion, but then black's rook can take the new queen\n- This leads to a drawn position\n\n5. Analysis of h4g5:\n- King moves to g5, attacking f3 pawn\n- Black can't promote immediately (f3f2 is met with Kg5xf2)\n- Then white can promote the d-pawn with check\n- This seems promising\n\n6. Other moves:\n- c5c6 doesn't address the immediate threat of the f-pawn\n- h4f6 allows f3f2 with a dangerous passed pawn\n\nThe best move is h4g5, bringing the king to attack the f3 pawn while maintaining the option to promote the d-pawn next move. This prevents black's counterplay and should lead to a winning position.\n\n```\nh4g5\n```"
