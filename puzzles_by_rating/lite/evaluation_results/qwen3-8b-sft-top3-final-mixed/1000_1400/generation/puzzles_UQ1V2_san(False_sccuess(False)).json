When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, queen, rook, and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on e5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on f8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black has a rook on c3 attacking White's pawn on b2\n- White's queen on g3 is well placed, eyeing the g7 pawn and potential checks\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Forking king and queen, but after ...Kxf7 White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- e5d7: Attacking the bishop, but Black can just move it\n- b5e8: Bishop sacrifice to open the king, but after ...Qxe8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- g3g7: Threatening mate on g8, but Black can defend with ...Qxg7\n- h1h4: Bringing the rook into play, but not immediately threatening\n\n4. Best move appears to be e5f7:\n- It's a knight fork attacking both king and queen\n- After ...Kxf7, White can play Qxg7+ winning the rook on h8\n- Even if Black tries ...Qxf7, White has Qxg7+ Kxg7 and the knight is still very strong\n- This leads to a material advantage for White\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. The knight fork is the most forcing and disruptive move.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
