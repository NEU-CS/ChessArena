If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook on d3, a knight on e6, and pawns on g7, h6, and g5. White has a rook on b6, a knight on c4, a pawn on d7 (about to promote), and pawns on g4 and h3. The kings are relatively safe.\n\nBlack to move.\n\n---\n\n## Key Observations:\n\n- **White's d7 pawn is one move from queening**. It's a major threat.\n- Black's rook on d3 is active and can potentially stop the pawn or create counterplay.\n- Black's knight on e6 is somewhat centralized but not doing much at the moment.\n- Black's king is on g5 \u2014 quite advanced, which could be dangerous if White gets a passed pawn.\n- Black has several legal moves, including moving the rook, knight, or pawns.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\n### Rook moves:\n- `d3d7`: Captures the dangerous d7 pawn. This seems very strong \u2014 it removes White's biggest threat.\n- `d3d6`, `d3d5`, `d3d4`: These keep pressure along the 6th rank or central files.\n- `d3h3`, `d3g3`, etc.: Could target weak pawns or support a kingside attack.\n\n### Knight moves:\n- `e6f8`, `e6d8`, `e6c7`, `e6c5`, `e6f4`, `e6d4`: Most of these are repositioning the knight. None seem immediately useful unless there's a tactical idea.\n\n### Pawn moves:\n- `g5g6`, `g5f6`, `g5h4`, `g5g4`, `g5f4`: These are mostly defensive or preparatory for a king-side push.\n- `h6h5`: A waiting move, possibly to prevent g5-g4 ideas.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most urgent issue is **White's d7 pawn**, which is about to promote. If left unchecked, White will queen with check or with a decisive advantage.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n\n### `d3d7` \u2014 Rook captures on d7\n\nThis removes the immediate threat of promotion and gives Black control over the 7th rank. After this capture, White cannot immediately promote, and Black gains time to reorganize.\n\nAfter `d3d7`, White must respond carefully. For example:\n- `Rb6xd7` would allow `Nc4-e3+` with a strong initiative for Black.\n- Other responses may give Black chances to win material or even the game.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n```\nd3d7\n```"
