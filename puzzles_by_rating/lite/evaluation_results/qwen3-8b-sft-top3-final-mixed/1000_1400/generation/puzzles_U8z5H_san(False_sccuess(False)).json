When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n3. Black has a strong bishop on g6 eyeing the b1-h7 diagonal\n4. White has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous\n5. Black's pawn on d4 is weak and could be targeted\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) b3b7 - attacking the rook, but after ...Rxb7 White doesn't gain much\nB) g2c6 - bishop sacrifice that looks tempting: 12. Bc6 Qxc6 13. Qxc6 bxc6 and White has a passed pawn, but Black's pieces become active\nC) b1c3 - developing the knight with tempo on the bishop\nD) e1g1 - castling to safety\nE) f4h6 - bishop sacrifice: 12. Bh6 Bxh6 13. Qxh6 and White has a strong attack\n\nAfter deep consideration:\n- The bishop sacrifice on h6 (f4h6) looks most promising as it opens Black's king position and creates immediate threats. After 12...Bxh6 13.Qxh6, White has a strong attack with the queen and rook ready to join the attack. Black's king will be very exposed and White can follow up with moves like Rh1 or O-O-O.\n\nOther moves either don't create enough threats or allow Black to consolidate. The bishop sacrifice is the most forcing and dangerous continuation.\n\n```\nf4h6\n```"
