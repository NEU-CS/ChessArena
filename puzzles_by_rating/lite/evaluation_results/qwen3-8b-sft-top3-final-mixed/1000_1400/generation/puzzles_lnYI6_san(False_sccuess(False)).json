When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, knight, and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on d5 that's very dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on e5\n- White's bishop on a3 is very active\n- Black's rook on f8 is currently passive\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rd6 next move, attacking the e6 pawn and threatening to promote the d-pawn\n- White's bishop could swing to h6, pinning the g6 pawn to the king\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8f7: Defends the e6 pawn but leaves the rook passive\n- e5f6: Moves the king away from danger but allows Rd6\n- c5d3: Knight fork attacking the rook and bishop\n- e5d4: King moves toward the center but exposes to checks\n\nAfter considering these options, c5d3 seems most promising because:\n- It creates an immediate tactical threat with the knight fork\n- After Rxd3, Bxd3 wins the exchange (rook for bishop)\n- If White doesn't take, Black maintains pressure\n- It forces White to deal with the threat rather than continuing their own plans\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or allow White to consolidate their advantage.\n\n```\nc5d3\n```"
