When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong knight on d4 attacking our queen and bishop\n3. Our bishop on e4 is very active but potentially trapped\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed with weak dark squares around it\n5. We have a passed pawn on a4 that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on d4 is a major problem - we need to deal with it\n- Our queen is under attack and needs to move or defend\n- We have potential tactics involving the bishop on e4\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e4b7 - Bishop takes rook, but after ...Qxb7 we lose material\n2. e4g6 - Bishop retreat, but doesn't solve the knight issue\n3. f3g5 - Developing the knight with tempo on the queen\n4. d2d4 - Queen takes knight, but after ...Qxd4 we lose our queen\n5. c1c8 - Bishop takes rook, but after ...Qxc8 we lose our bishop\n\nAfter careful consideration, f3g5 seems strongest because:\n- It develops a piece with tempo (attacking the queen)\n- After Qxg5, we can play Bxd4 winning a piece\n- If Black doesn't take, we maintain pressure\n- It maintains our active piece play while solving the knight issue\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. The bishop retreats don't improve our position, and the queen moves either lose material or don't solve our problems.\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
