When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: King on a4, Bishop on d6, Pawn on b5, e4, f2, g6, and a Queen on f5.\n- **Black**: King on h5, Bishop on b6, Rook on b8, Pawn on e5, and a Queen on d2.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Black\u2019s king is in the corner (h5), but not immediately under threat.\n- White has a dangerous passed pawn on g6, supported by the queen on f5.\n- Black\u2019s queen is active on d2, eyeing the white king and possibly threatening checks.\n- Black\u2019s rook is on b8, which could become active if the b-file opens up.\n- Black\u2019s bishop on b6 is somewhat passive but can support the e5 pawn or help defend.\n- The most immediate danger for Black is the g6 pawn, which is one step from queening.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `h5h6`: King moves to h6\n- `h5h4`: King moves to h4\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate both:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `h5h6` (King to h6)\n- This keeps the king away from the center and closer to the edge.\n- It avoids potential checks from the white queen along the 5th rank.\n- However, it doesn't stop the g6 pawn from advancing to g7 and queening unless supported.\n\n#### 2. `h5h4` (King to h4)\n- This brings the king closer to the center and potentially toward the g6 pawn.\n- It also threatens to capture the g6 pawn if White isn't careful.\n- More importantly, this move puts pressure on the g6 pawn directly.\n\n---\n\n### Tactical Insight:\nThe key idea here is that **Black can win by capturing the g6 pawn**. If Black can take on g6, then White cannot immediately queen, and Black may have drawing or even winning chances depending on how the rest of the game unfolds.\n\nSo, **`h5h4`** is the better move because:\n- It threatens to capture the g6 pawn.\n- It centralizes the king slightly.\n- It gives Black more control over the critical g6 square.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\nh5h4\n```"
