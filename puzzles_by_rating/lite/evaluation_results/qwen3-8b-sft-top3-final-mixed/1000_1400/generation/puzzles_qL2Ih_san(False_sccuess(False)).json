If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Castling (`g8h8`) is a logical first step toward securing the king and connecting the rooks. While White has an active queen, Black can respond by developing pieces and preparing counterplay in the center or on the queenside.\n\nHowever, we should consider whether castling immediately is safe. Let's look at what happens after:\n\n### After `g8h8`:\n- White might play `Qxg6`, threatening the pawn on g6 and possibly opening up the h-file.\n- Then Black would have to respond with `hxg6`, and White could follow up with `Rh1`, putting pressure on the h-file.\n\nThat seems risky.\n\nSo instead, perhaps better to **develop a piece first**, like the knight to c6 or bishop to c5, before castling.\n\nBetween those two, **`b8c6`** looks best because:\n- It develops a piece.\n- It supports central play.\n- It doesn\u2019t commit the king yet.\n- It keeps options open for both castling and central counterplay.\n\n---\n\n## Final Move:\n\n```\nb8c6\n```"
