When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, knight, rook vs White's queen, rook, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on h5 is active but could be vulnerable\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg6+ winning the pawn\n- White could also play Qf7+ forcing the king to move\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h8: Gets the king to safety but looks passive\n- c6e5: Blocks the queen's diagonal and attacks the d4 pawn\n- h5h6: Moves the rook to a safer square\n- b6d4: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n\nAfter considering these options, b6d4 seems most principled because:\n- It eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- It opens the b-file for potential rook activity\n- It maintains material equality\n- It doesn't allow any immediate tactics from White\n\nOther moves either leave the king exposed or don't address the key issues in the position.\n\n```\nb6d4\n```"
