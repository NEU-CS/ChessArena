When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, knight, bishop, queen vs White's rook, knight, bishop, queen). \n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong centralized knight on e5 and bishop on d4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White's queen on h3 is eyeing the h7 pawn\n- Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on b6\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: King moves to h8, but this seems passive and doesn't address any threats\n- f8f7: Rook moves to f7, but this blocks the bishop on e7\n- e7f7: Bishop moves to f7, but this allows Qxf7+ winning the bishop\n- e7e6: Bishop moves to e6, but this allows Bxe6 fxe6 opening the f-file\n- b7d5: Bishop moves to d5, attacking the knight on e5\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- b7d5 is the most active move, attacking the knight and forcing a decision\n- After b7d5, if White takes (Nxd5), Black can recapture with exd5, opening the e-file for the rook\n- If White doesn't take, Black maintains pressure on e5\n- Other moves either don't address the threats or create new weaknesses\n\nThe best move is to activate the bishop with:\n\n```\nb7d5\n```"
