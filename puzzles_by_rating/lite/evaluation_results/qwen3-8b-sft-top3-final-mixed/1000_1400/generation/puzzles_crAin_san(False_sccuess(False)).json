When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong knight on e4 that's very active\n3. White's bishop on b5 is under attack by the knight on e4\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n5. Black has threats like ...Qd7 or ...Bd7 developing\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to deal with the threat to the bishop on b5\n- Should consider castling if possible\n- Need to address the active black knight on e4\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. b5c6 - Capturing the knight but allowing ...bxc6 opening the b-file\n2. e1g1 - Castling immediately to safety\n3. f3e5 - Attacking the knight but allowing ...Bxe5\n4. c1g5 - Developing with tempo against the knight\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Castling (e1g1) is very tempting but the knight on e4 is too strong\n- b5c6 is interesting but gives Black active play after ...bxc6\n- c1g5 is best as it develops with tempo, forcing the knight to move while maintaining pressure\n\nThe move c1g5:\n- Develops the bishop with tempo (attacking the knight)\n- If ...Nf6, then Bxf6 gxf6 and White has the bishop pair\n- If ...Nxd2, then Qxd2 and White is fine\n- Maintains control of the position\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc1g5\n```"
