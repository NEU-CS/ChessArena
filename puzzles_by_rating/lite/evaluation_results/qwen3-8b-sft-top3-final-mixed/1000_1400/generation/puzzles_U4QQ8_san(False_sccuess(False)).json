When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong pawn center with pawns on d5 and c6\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the f6 knight blocking the g8 square\n4. White's pieces are more active - bishop on b4 pins the knight, bishop on e3 eyes f6\n5. Black's dark-squared bishop is very active on d6\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the pin on the f6 knight\n- Need to develop the queenside pieces\n- Need to find counterplay against White's strong center\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f6h7 - moves the knight out of pin but blocks the h-file\n2. f6d7 - centralizes the knight but blocks the d-file\n3. b8d7 - develops the knight but leaves f6 pinned\n4. c8d7 - develops the bishop but doesn't solve the pin\n5. d6e7 - moves the bishop but gives up control of d5\n\nBest option seems to be f6h7:\n- Gets the knight out of the pin\n- Prepares to possibly bring it back to g5 later\n- Doesn't block any important files\n- Maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves either don't solve the pin or create new weaknesses. While h7 isn't the most active square for the knight, it's the most practical solution to the immediate problem.\n\n```\nf6h7\n```"
