When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, knight vs White's rook, bishop, knight). However, White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on c6 pinning Black's pawn on b6 to the king\n- Black's king is exposed in the center (e7)\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on h8 is passive\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rd1 next, increasing pressure on the d-file\n- White might try to push the e-pawn or activate the rook further\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook off the back rank but doesn't solve other issues\n- e7f8: Moves the king away from the pin but into potential checks\n- d4e5: Capturing the pawn but allowing Bxe5 with discovered attack\n- b8b7: Develops the knight but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- c8d7: Blocks the pin but leaves the king exposed\n\nAfter considering these options, the best move appears to be e7f8. While it moves the king into potential checks, it:\n- Gets out of the pin on the b6 pawn\n- Prepares to potentially castle queenside later\n- Avoids immediate tactical threats\n- Keeps options open for both pieces and king\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or create new weaknesses. While the king will be exposed on f8, it's better than staying in the center where it's more vulnerable.\n\n```\ne7f8\n```"
