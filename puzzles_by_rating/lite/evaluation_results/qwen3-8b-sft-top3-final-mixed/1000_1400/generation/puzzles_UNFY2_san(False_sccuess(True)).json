Black has a king on e6, pawns on c6, d5, e5, c3, and h5. White has a queen on g8, pawns on h4, f3, g2, and a king on h3.\n\nBlack to move.\n\n### Legal moves:\n- `e6e7` \u2013 King moves to e7\n- `e6d7` \u2013 King moves to d7\n- `e6d6` \u2013 King moves to d6\n- `e6f5` \u2013 King moves to f5\n\nWe must choose the best move for Black.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation:\n\nWhite\u2019s queen is on g8, which is quite active and could threaten checks or support pawn advances. Black\u2019s king is in the center but relatively safe for now.\n\nBlack has several pawns on the queenside (c6, d5, c3) and one on the kingside (h5). The king is in the center, so it may be vulnerable to checks from the white queen.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n### 1. `e6e7` \u2013 King to e7\n\n- Centralizes the king slightly more.\n- Keeps king away from the edge.\n- Not immediately dangerous to White\u2019s queen.\n- May allow White to play Qg7+ or Qg5+ with tempo.\n\n**Verdict:** Solid, but not particularly aggressive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `e6d7` \u2013 King to d7\n\n- Brings king closer to the queenside pawns.\n- Could help support a counterplay plan with ...c5 or ...d4.\n- Also avoids potential back-rank issues.\n- Might walk into a discovered attack if White plays Qg7+ followed by f4.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable, but not clearly best.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `e6d6` \u2013 King to d6\n\n- Very active square.\n- Central control.\n- Supports both c5 and e5 breaks.\n- Could help in pushing pawns forward.\n- Also prepares to potentially support a ...c4 break.\n\n**Verdict:** Strong candidate. Active and flexible.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `e6f5` \u2013 King to f5\n\n- Very aggressive.\n- Places king on a very active square.\n- Threatens to infiltrate White\u2019s position.\n- Could support a ...h4 push or even a ...g5 break.\n- However, this might be too risky \u2014 White can respond with Qg5+ or Qg7+, forcing the king back.\n\n**Verdict:** Risky but dynamic. Could be good if White misplays.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\n\nThe most **solid and flexible** move is **`e6d6`**, placing the king on a central, active square that supports both queenside and kingside play.\n\nIt avoids unnecessary risks while improving king activity.\n\n---\n\n```\ne6d6\n```"

This supports the c3 pawn, reduces king exposure, and keeps Black in control of the position.\n\n```\nd6c7\n```"
