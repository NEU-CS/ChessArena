When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on b5 pinning the knight on f6 to the king\n- Black's queen on e4 is very active but potentially loose\n- White's king is exposed on e1 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's rook on h8 is undeveloped\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qd1+ next move, forcing Black's king to move\n- White might try to exploit the pin with Bxf6\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4e3: Queen sacrifice to expose White's king\n- f5h4: Threatening mate on f2\n- f8b4: Developing the bishop with tempo on the queen\n- e4d4: Centralizing the queen while maintaining pressure\n\nAfter deep consideration:\n- e4e3 looks tempting but after Qxe3, Black doesn't have enough compensation\n- f5h4 is interesting but White can defend with g3\n- f8b4 is solid, developing with tempo and maintaining pressure\n- e4d4 is the most flexible, keeping all options open while centralizing the queen\n\nThe best move is e4d4, maintaining maximum activity and flexibility while keeping pressure on White's position. It prevents Qd1+ and keeps the queen active in the center.\n\n```\ne4d4\n```"
