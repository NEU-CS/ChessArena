When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Knight vs Black's Rook, Knight. Material is equal, but White has a passed pawn on a3.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook is very active on d1, threatening to capture the b2 pawn\n- White's rook on c8 is very active but needs to be careful about Black's knight on f4\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but Black doesn't have immediate threats\n- Black's king is on h7, which could be vulnerable if we can open lines\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: c8h8 looks tempting to attack the king, but after ...Rh1 we might lose the rook\n- Knight moves: e5f7+ forks king and rook, but after ...Kxf7 we lose the knight\n- King safety: g1h1 gets the king off the dangerous d1-h7 diagonal\n- Pawn moves: a3a4 pushes the passed pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be g1h1 because:\n- It removes the king from the dangerous diagonal controlled by Black's rook\n- It prepares to potentially bring the king to g2 to support the pawns\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Other moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat to b2\n\nAfter g1h1, if Black takes b2 with ...Rxb2, we can play a3a4 and our passed pawn becomes very strong.\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
