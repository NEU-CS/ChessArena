When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a passed pawn on b5 and a rook deep in enemy territory (c5). Black\u2019s king is relatively exposed.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### 1. **c5c8** \u2013 Rook takes rook!\n- This is a **very tempting move**: Rxc8 wins a rook for free.\n- Let's check if it's safe:\n  - After `c5c8`, Black can respond with `b1c2`, attacking the rook on c8.\n  - But then White can play `b2c3`, defending the rook.\n  - So after `c5c8 b1c2 b2c3`, White still keeps the rook and gains material.\n\n#### 2. **c5c7** \u2013 Rook to 7th rank, threatening to promote or support b-pawn.\n- Also strong, but not as immediately decisive as taking the rook.\n\n#### 3. **b5b6** \u2013 Pushing the passed pawn.\n- Could be good, but less forcing than capturing the rook.\n\n#### 4. **b2h8** \u2013 Bishop to h8, threatening mate on g7.\n- Tempting, but Black can defend with ...Kg7 or ...Rh8.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n\nThe most **immediate and decisive** move is:\n\n```\nc5c8\n```\n\nThis captures a rook and forces Black to respond. It gives White a clear material advantage and puts pressure on Black\u2019s position.\n\n---\n\n```\nc5c8\n```"
