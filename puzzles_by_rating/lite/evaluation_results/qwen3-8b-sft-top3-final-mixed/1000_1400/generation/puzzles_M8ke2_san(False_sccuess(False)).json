When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's rook, bishop, queen. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on f5 that could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on c6 is very active, attacking the rook on f8 and bishop on b8\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed f-pawn that could promote if supported\n- Black has a passed a-pawn that's not yet dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: c6e8+ forces the king to move (Kh7) and then we can play Qxh8 winning the rook\n- f5e6 is interesting, opening the f-file for the rook and threatening e7\n- e1e6 is tempting to double rooks on the e-file\n\n4. Calculating c6e8+:\n- 36. Qe8+ Kh7 (only move)\n- 37. Qxh8 and White wins a rook for free\n- Black can't recapture as the bishop is pinned to the king\n\n5. Other queen moves don't seem as forcing or don't win material immediately. The f-pawn push is good but not as decisive.\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is Qe8+, which leads to winning the rook on h8. There's no way for Black to prevent this loss of material.\n\n```\nc6e8\n```"
