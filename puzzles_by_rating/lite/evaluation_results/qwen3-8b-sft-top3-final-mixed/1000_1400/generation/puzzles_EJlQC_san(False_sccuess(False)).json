When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen on g6 is very active, eyeing the g2 pawn\n- White's rook on f1 is under attack by Black's pawn on f4\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h2\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f1f4: Capturing the pawn that attacks our rook, but after ...Qxf4 we lose material\n- d3a6: Queen move attacking the rook, but Black can just move it\n- c1c8: Rook lift to attack the rook, but Black can defend\n- e5e6: Pushing the pawn to create threats, but it's not immediately dangerous\n- h3h4: King safety move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be f1f4:\n- We must deal with the threat to our rook\n- After f1f4 Qxf4, we can play Qxf4 Rxf4 and then Rxf4\n- This leads to an equal rook endgame where we have connected passed pawns on the queenside\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat. While the position remains complex after f1f4, it's the most forcing and principled move.\n\n```\nf1f4\n```"
