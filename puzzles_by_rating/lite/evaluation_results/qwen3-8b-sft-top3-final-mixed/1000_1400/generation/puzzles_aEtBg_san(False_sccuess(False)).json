When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on g7 is very active, attacking the black king on d6\n- Black's queen on f2 is threatening mate on h2 (Qh2#)\n- Black's rook on e3 is pinning White's bishop on f3 to the king\n- White's pawn on d5 is passed and dangerous\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's Qh2# is the most urgent threat that must be addressed\n- White's queen can deliver checks but needs to be careful about getting trapped\n\n4. Candidate moves to stop Qh2#:\n- g7h7 blocks the queen's path to h2\n- g7f7 also blocks the queen's path\n- g7g6 would block with the queen, but allows Qh2# after Qxg6\n\n5. Other considerations:\n- After g7h7, Black can play Qxh7, but then White has Bxe3 winning the rook\n- After g7f7, Black can play Qxf7, but then White has Bxe3 as well\n- g7h7 seems better because after Qxh7 Bxe3, White's queen is more active than Black's rook\n\n6. Alternative ideas:\n- Pushing pawns (g4g5, c4c5, b3b4) don't address the mate threat\n- Moving the bishop (Bf3) would lose to Qxh2#\n\nThe best move is clearly g7h7, stopping the mate threat while maintaining material equality and keeping the queen active.\n\n```\ng7h7\n```"
