When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs Black's queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g5, eyeing the g2 pawn\n- White's bishop on d3 is under attack by the knight on g3\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d3g6: Bishop takes knight, but after Qxg6 White loses material\n- d3a6: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- f2g3: Capturing the knight, but allows Qxg3 winning a pawn\n- f2e3: Protecting the bishop while developing the queen\n- a1a4: Rook lift to potentially attack the queenside\n- f3f4: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n\n4. Best options seem to be:\n- f2e3: Safely protects the bishop while developing the queen's potential\n- f3f4: Gains space and limits Black's queen mobility\n\nAfter considering these, f3f4 seems most principled:\n- Gains space in the center\n- Limits Black's queen options (can't go to e5 or f5)\n- Prepares to push the f-pawn further if needed\n- Maintains all of White's pieces active\n\nThe other moves either lose material or are too passive.\n\n```\nf3f4\n```"
