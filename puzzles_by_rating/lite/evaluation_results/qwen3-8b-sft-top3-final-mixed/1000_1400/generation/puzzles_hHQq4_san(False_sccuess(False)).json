When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has queen, bishop, and pawns\n   - Black has queen, rook, and pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen on e6 is very strong, attacking g8 and controlling key squares\n   - Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n   - White has a passed pawn on g4 that could become dangerous\n   - Black's rook on f8 is currently passive\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - g8h8: King moves to h8 - this seems passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n   - g8h7: King moves to h7 - this walks into potential checks from White's queen\n   - f8f7: Rook moves to f7 - this seems most active, defending the king while activating the rook\n\n4. Evaluating f8f7:\n   - Defends the king by covering the f-file\n   - Prepares to potentially double rooks on the f-file\n   - Keeps options open for the king to move to h8 if needed\n   - Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\n5. The other moves are worse:\n   - g8h8 leaves the king in a passive position\n   - g8h7 walks into potential discovered checks from White's bishop\n\nAfter careful consideration, f8f7 is the most principled move, activating the rook while maintaining king safety. The other options either passively retreat the king or expose it to danger.\n\n```\nf8f7\n```"
