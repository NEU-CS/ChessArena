When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong bishop on h6 pinning the f8 rook to the king\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White has threats like Qg4+ or Bxf8 winning material\n5. Black needs to address the immediate threats while improving piece coordination\n\nKey observations:\n- The pin on the f8 rook is very dangerous\n- The knight on g8 is awkwardly placed\n- The queen on d7 is somewhat exposed\n- The bishop on b6 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h8f7 - unpins the rook but leaves the knight on g8\n2. g8f7 - blocks the pin but leaves the rook pinned\n3. f8f7 - blocks the pin but loses the rook to Bxf7+\n4. d7f6 - moves the queen to safety while attacking the bishop\n5. b6c5 - develops the bishop and opens lines\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d7f6 seems best as it:\n  - Gets the queen to safety\n  - Attacks the dangerous bishop on h6\n  - Maintains control of key squares\n  - Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the position too vulnerable. The queen move also prepares potential counterplay along the f-file.\n\n```\nd7f6\n```"
