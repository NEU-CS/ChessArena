When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong knight on e3 that's forking our queen and rook\n3. Black's bishop on e6 is very active, eyeing our kingside\n4. Our king is still in the center, which is dangerous\n5. We have some tactical opportunities due to the knight fork\n\nKey considerations:\n- We must deal with the knight fork immediately\n- We can either capture the knight or move our queen/rook\n- Capturing with Qxe3 seems best as it removes the threat and maintains material equality\n- After Qxe3, we can think about castling or developing our rook\n\nOther candidate moves:\n- Moving the queen away (like Qd1) would lose the rook after Nxd1\n- Castling immediately is risky due to Black's active pieces\n- Developing the rook (like Rd1) would still leave the knight fork threat\n\nThe most forcing and best move appears to be capturing the knight:\n\n```\nd2e3\n```"
