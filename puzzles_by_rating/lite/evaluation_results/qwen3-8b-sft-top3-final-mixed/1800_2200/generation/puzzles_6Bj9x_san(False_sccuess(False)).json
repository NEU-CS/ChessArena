When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on g7 is very active, attacking the black king on h6\n- Black's king is exposed on h6 with limited squares\n- Black has a passed pawn on a6 that could become dangerous\n- White's bishop on d1 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7g8: Rook lift to 8th rank, threatening mate on h8\n- g7h7: Direct attack on king, but allows ...Rh8 pin\n- g3g6: Pushing pawn to open lines, but may not be most forcing\n- e1f2: Developing bishop, but slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be g7g8:\n- Threatens immediate mate on h8 (Rh8#)\n- Black has no good way to prevent this:\n  - If ...Rh8, then Rg6+ wins the rook\n  - If ...Bxg8, then Rxg8+ Kxg8 and White has R vs R+B with passed pawns\n  - Other moves allow Rh8#\n\nThis is the most forcing and decisive move, leading to a winning advantage.\n\n```\ng7g8\n```"
