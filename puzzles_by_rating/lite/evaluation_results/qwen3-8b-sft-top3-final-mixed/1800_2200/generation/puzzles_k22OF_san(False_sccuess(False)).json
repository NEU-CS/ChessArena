When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has king + knight vs White's king + bishop + pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on g6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's knight is somewhat restricted by White's pawn structure\n- White has connected passed pawns on the queenside (a4, c5)\n- Black's king is exposed in the center\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Knight moves: f6g8 looks interesting to reposition the knight\n- King moves: c6d7 or c6c7 to centralize the king\n- Pawn moves: e5e4 to challenge White's pawn structure\n\n4. Evaluating f6g8:\n- Gets the knight to a safer square\n- Prepares potential knight forks\n- But doesn't address the immediate threats\n\n5. Evaluating c6d7:\n- Centralizes the king\n- Gets away from potential bishop checks\n- But allows White to push pawns\n\n6. Evaluating e5e4:\n- Challenges White's pawn structure\n- Opens lines for Black's pieces\n- But gives White's bishop more scope\n\nAfter considering these options, c6d7 seems most prudent:\n- It improves king safety\n- Prepares to stop White's pawn advances\n- Maintains flexibility for the knight\n\nThe other moves either don't address the main problems or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nc6d7\n```"
