When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized queen on d4 and knight on f3\n3. Black has a knight on e5 that's under attack by White's queen\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed with White's rook on f1\n5. Black's queen is on d8 and needs to find safety\n\nKey considerations:\n- The knight on e5 is attacked by the queen and needs to be dealt with\n- Black's queen is somewhat awkwardly placed on d8\n- Black needs to activate his pieces while maintaining king safety\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5d7 - moves the knight to safety while attacking the queen\n2. d8e7 - connects rooks and defends the knight\n3. e4f6 - moves the other knight to a safer square\n4. d8f6 - queen takes the knight, but this seems risky\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- e5d7 looks tempting but after Qxd7, Black's position becomes passive\n- d8e7 is solid, defending the knight and connecting rooks\n- e4f6 is interesting but leaves the e5 knight hanging\n- d8f6 Qxf6 is too risky as it opens lines against Black's king\n\nThe most solid move appears to be d8e7, which:\n- Defends the e5 knight\n- Connects the rooks\n- Prepares to possibly double rooks on the e-file\n- Maintains flexibility for future plans\n\nOther moves either leave material hanging or create weaknesses. While e5d7 seems active, it leads to a passive position after Qxd7.\n\n```\nd8e7\n```"
