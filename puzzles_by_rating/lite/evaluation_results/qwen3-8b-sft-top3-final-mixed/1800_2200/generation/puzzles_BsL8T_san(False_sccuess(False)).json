When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has R+B+N vs Black's R+B+N). Black has a passed pawn on c5, but White has a passed pawn on e6.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's e6 pawn is very strong and threatening to promote\n- Black's rook on f5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on d4 is pinning White's e3 bishop to the king\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3h6: Bishop sacrifice to remove the f7 pawn defender\n- e6e7: Pushing the passed pawn (but Black can play Rxe7)\n- e2g4: Attacking the f5 rook\n- f1g3: Developing the rook and attacking the bishop\n\n4. Deep analysis:\n- e3h6 looks tempting as it removes the f7 pawn, but after ...gxh6, White's e6 pawn is still strong but Black can defend with ...Rxe6\n- e2g4 is interesting: after ...Rxe4, White can play e6e7 with strong threats\n- f1g3 is solid, attacking the bishop and preparing to double rooks on the g-file\n\nAfter considering these options, e2g4 seems most promising because:\n- It attacks the active rook\n- If ...Rxe4, then e6e7 is crushing as the pawn is unstoppable\n- If ...Rg5, then Bxg5 wins a pawn\n- It maintains all of White's positional advantages\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ne2g4\n```"
