King safety: White's king is exposed on h2, while Black's king is more active on g5.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has connected passed pawns on c4 and c3, while Black has a passed pawn on h3.\n\n4. Immediate threats: Black's bishop on e6 is eyeing White's pawns, and the h3 pawn is close to queening.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- h2g3: Gets the king closer to the h3 pawn but exposes it to checks\n- h2h1: Retreats the king but doesn't address threats\n- f1h3: Blocks the h-pawn but allows ...Bxh3 winning a pawn\n- f1d3: Centralizes the bishop but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f1g2: Protects the h2 square but doesn't stop h3\n- f1e2: Similar to g2 but less active\n\nBest move seems to be f1h3, blocking the h-pawn's advance. Even though it loses the bishop after ...Bxh3, it's necessary to prevent the pawn from queening. After Bxh3, White can play Kxh3 and then push the c-pawns with good winning chances.\n\n```\nf1h3\n```"

The legal moves are:\n- `h2h3` \u2013 King moves to h3\n- `h2g3` \u2013 King moves to g3\n- `h2h1` \u2013 King moves to h1\n- `h2g1` \u2013 King moves to g1\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nWhite has a **king and two pawns** (on c3 and c4), while Black has a **king and a bishop** (on h3). Black\u2019s bishop is currently **pinned** to the h3 square by the fact that moving it would expose the black king to check from the white king.\n\nThe key idea for White is to **promote one of the pawns**, ideally the c-pawn, since it's more advanced. However, the black king is close enough to potentially stop the pawn if not handled correctly.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `h2h3` \u2013 King to h3\n- This places the king directly in front of the black bishop.\n- It threatens to capture the bishop next move (`Kxh3`).\n- Black cannot move the bishop without exposing their king to check.\n- This is a **very strong move**, as it forces Black to either:\n  - Move the bishop (losing it),\n  - Or move the king away, giving White space to advance the pawns.\n\nThis move puts immediate pressure on Black and gains tempo.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. `h2g3` \u2013 King to g3\n- Also threatens to capture the bishop.\n- Slightly less central than h3.\n- Still good, but not as forcing as h3.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. `h2h1` \u2013 King to h1\n- Retreats the king.\n- Weakens control over the center and the h-file.\n- Not useful here.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. `h2g1` \u2013 King to g1\n- Also retreats the king.\n- No real benefit.\n- Not useful here.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`h2h3`**, which puts maximum pressure on Black and forces them into a defensive position. It also prepares to win the bishop or gain space.\n\n```\nh2h3\n```"

Black has a king on f4 and a pawn on c5.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite wants to promote one of their pawns or prevent Black from doing so. The key is to control the critical squares around the pawns and use the king effectively.\n\n### Current Position Summary:\n\n- **White King**: h3\n- **Black King**: f4\n- **White Pawns**: c3, c4\n- **Black Pawn**: c5\n\nThe black king is currently in front of the white pawns, which is dangerous for White because it could potentially capture the pawns if not handled correctly.\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `h3h4` \u2013 King moves up\n- `h3h2` \u2013 King moves down\n- `h3g2` \u2013 King moves left\n\nWe must choose the best move to either:\n- Win by promoting a pawn, or\n- Prevent Black from making progress and force a draw.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move Analysis:\n\n#### 1. `h3h4`\n- This brings the king closer to the center and supports potential pawn advancement.\n- It also keeps pressure on the black king, limiting its mobility.\n- After this move, White can consider pushing the c-pawns with support from the king.\n\n#### 2. `h3h2`\n- This retreats the king, giving Black more freedom.\n- Not ideal as it allows Black to maneuver freely and possibly win the pawns.\n\n#### 3. `h3g2`\n- This moves the king away from the action toward the queenside.\n- It gives Black more space and initiative.\n- Not recommended.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n`h3h4` is the most active and logical move. It improves the king\u2019s position, restricts Black\u2019s king, and prepares for further pawn advances.\n\n```\nh3h4\n```"
