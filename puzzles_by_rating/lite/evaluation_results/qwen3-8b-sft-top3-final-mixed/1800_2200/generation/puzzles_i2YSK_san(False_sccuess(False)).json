When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h6 is very active, attacking f8 and g7\n- Black's king is exposed on e7 with limited pawn cover\n- Black has a bishop on g2 pinning White's rook on h3 to the king\n- White has a passed pawn on d5 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h8: Queen sacrifice to remove Black's queen, but after ...Qxh8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- h6f8: Queen takes rook, but after ...Kxf8 White's attack fizzles out\n- h6g7: Queen takes pawn with check, but after ...Kxg7 White's attack is broken\n- c3b5: Knight move attacking the pinned rook, but Black can defend with ...Bd5\n- d5e6: Pushing the passed pawn, but Black can play ...fxe6\n- h3g3: Breaking the pin by moving the rook, but this seems passive\n\n4. Best move appears to be h6g7+:\n- Forces the king to take: ...Kxg7\n- Then we can play h3g3, breaking the pin and threatening to double rooks on the g-file\n- Black's king will be very exposed and White can follow up with moves like Rg1+ or Qg6+\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and dangerous continuation, keeping Black under pressure.\n\n```\nh6g7\n```"
