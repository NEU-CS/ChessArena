When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on g6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's knight on h4 is under attack by White's bishop on f5\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White's rook on f7 is very active\n\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens to play Rxf8 winning the rook\n- White could also play Bxh4 winning the knight\n- The g6 pawn is close to promotion\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4g6: Capturing the dangerous pawn, but after Bxg6 White's bishop remains strong\n- d2h6: Blocking the pawn with the bishop, but White can play Rxf8\n- f8h8: Moving the rook to defend against Rxf8, but allows Bxh4\n- h4f5: Moving the knight to safety while attacking the bishop\n\nAfter considering these options, h4f5 seems best because:\n- It saves the knight while attacking the bishop\n- After Bxf5, Black can play Rxf7 winning the rook\n- It maintains material equality while reducing White's attacking potential\n- It prevents the immediate threat of Bxh4\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow White to maintain too much pressure.\n\n```\nh4f5\n```"
