When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal, but White's pawn is more advanced.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on g5\n- Black's rook is on c4, controlling the c-file\n- Black's king is on b3, somewhat exposed\n- White's king is on e3, central but potentially vulnerable\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: g5g8 looks tempting to check the black king\n- King moves: e3f4 centralizes the king\n- Pawn moves: f2f4 advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Evaluating g5g8:\n- After g5g8+, black must play Kc3 (only legal move)\n- Then we can play Rg3+ winning the rook on c4\n- This leads to a winning king and pawn endgame\n\n5. Other options:\n- e3f4 allows black to play Rc1 with counterplay\n- f2f4 is premature as black can respond with ...Rc1\n\nThe most forcing and winning line is g5g8+, leading to the sequence:\n1. g5g8+ Kc3\n2. Rg3+ Kb4\n3. Rxc4 Kxc4\nAnd White's king can then win the pawns.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5g8\n```"
