When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on d6 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a strong bishop pair\n- Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e8: Forking king and rook, but after ...Qxe8 White doesn't get enough\n- d6f7: Threatening mate on g7, but Black can defend with ...Qe7\n- g5d8: Bishop sacrifice, but after ...Qxd8 White doesn't have enough\n- g4c8: Bishop sacrifice, but after ...Qxc8 White doesn't have enough\n- f1f8: Rook sacrifice, but after ...Kxf8 White doesn't have enough\n\n4. Best move appears to be d6e8:\n- It's a knight fork attacking both king and rook\n- After ...Qxe8, White can play Bxh6 with a strong attack\n- Black's king will be very exposed\n- White maintains initiative and attacking chances\n\nOther moves either don't create enough threats or allow Black to consolidate. The knight fork is the most forcing and dangerous continuation.\n\n```\nd6e8\n```"
