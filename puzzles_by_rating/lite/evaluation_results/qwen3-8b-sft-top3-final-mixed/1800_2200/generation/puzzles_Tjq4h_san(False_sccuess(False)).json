When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a strong knight on f4 attacking White's pawn on e2\n- White's queen is very active on b2\n- Black's queen is on f7, potentially vulnerable to checks\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2f4: Capturing the knight, but after ...Qxf4 White's position remains complicated\n- b2b7: Threatening the rook on f8, but Black can defend with ...Qe7\n- b2e5: Centralizing the queen, attacking f5 and potentially threatening mate ideas\n- g1f2: Moving the king to safety, but seems passive\n- b2d4: Centralizing the queen while attacking the e4 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be b2e5:\n- Centralizes the queen maximally\n- Attacks the e4 pawn which is only defended by the knight\n- Creates potential mating threats against Black's king\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- If Black takes the queen with ...Qxe5, White can recapture with Nxe5 and remain with a slight advantage\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position as much or allow Black to consolidate. The queen move to e5 is the most active and threatening option.\n\n```\nb2e5\n```"
