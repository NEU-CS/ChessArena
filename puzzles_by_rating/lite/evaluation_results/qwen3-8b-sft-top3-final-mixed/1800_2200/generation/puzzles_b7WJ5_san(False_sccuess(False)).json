When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- White's bishop on d4 is pinning Black's g5 pawn to the king\n- Black's queen on b3 is somewhat passive\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg5 winning a pawn\n- White could also play Qe6+ forcing the king to move\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h6h7: Gets the king away from potential checks but leaves it exposed\n- h6g6: Moves towards the center but still exposed\n- b3e6: Blocks the e6 check but allows Qxg5\n- b3d5: Blocks the pin on g5 but allows Qe6+\n- g5g4: Pushes the pawn but allows Qxg4\n\nAfter considering these, the best move appears to be b3d5:\n- It blocks the pin on the g5 pawn\n- It prevents Qe6+ by controlling e6\n- It activates the queen more\n- After Qxg5, Black can play Qd4+ winning the bishop\n\nOther moves either allow immediate material loss or leave the king too exposed.\n\n```\nb3d5\n```"
