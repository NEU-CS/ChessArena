When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Not urgent unless under threat.\n\n### Rook on c7:\n- `c7c8`: Could double rooks on the 8th rank, but not immediately threatening.\n- `c7h7`: Attacks the white rook on h5 \u2014 this looks promising.\n- `c7g7`: Supports the g-file, possibly preparing ...Rg7+.\n- `c7f7`: Defends against potential back-rank threats.\n- `c7e7`, `c7d7`, etc.: Less active.\n\n### Rook on g4:\n- `g4g8`: Doubles rooks on the 8th rank.\n- `g4g7`: Supports ...Rg7+.\n- `g4g6`: Pressures the g6 square, supports ...Rg6+.\n- `g4g5`: Could pin the f6 pawn.\n- `g4h4`: Exchanges rooks, but not ideal unless forced.\n\n### Bishop on d3:\n- `d3h7`: Captures the rook on h5 \u2014 this is a **very strong move**.\n- `d3g6`, `d3a6`, etc.: Other bishop moves, but less effective than capturing the rook.\n\n### Pawns:\n- `b6b5`: Advances the passed pawn.\n- `d5d4`: Opens up the center, but may help White.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most **tangible and immediate gain** is:\n\n### `d3h7` \u2013 Bishop captures rook on h5\n\nThis removes a key attacker from White and gives Black a material advantage (bishop for rook). It also opens the h-file for Black\u2019s rook on g4, potentially leading to a strong attack.\n\nAfter `d3h7`, White must respond. Let's see what happens:\n\n- `Rxh7` (forced)\n- Then `Rg7+` follows, forcing the white king to move.\n- Black can then bring in the other rook with `Rc1` or `Rc8`, depending on how things unfold.\n\nThis sequence gives Black a clear advantage and active play.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n```\nd3h7\n```"
