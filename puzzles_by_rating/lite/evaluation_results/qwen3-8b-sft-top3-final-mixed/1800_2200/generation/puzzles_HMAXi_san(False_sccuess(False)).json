When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong knight on f5 attacking g7 and e7\n3. Black's king is exposed on f7 with limited pawn cover\n4. White's bishop on f6 is very active, pinning the g7 pawn to the king\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Nxe7+ winning the queen\n- We need to address this threat while improving our position\n- Moving the king to g8 seems safest, but then Qd7+ would be annoying\n- Blocking with ...Qe7 seems passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n- ...Qf6 looks interesting to challenge the bishop, but after Bxe7 Qxe7, White has Nxe7+ Kxe7 with a slight advantage\n\nAfter considering these options, the best move appears to be moving the queen to e7, which:\n1. Blocks the check threat from Nxe7+\n2. Defends the f6 bishop\n3. Keeps the queen active\n4. Prepares potential ...Qf6 ideas later\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the king too exposed. While ...Qe7 does allow some counterplay, it's the most resilient option.\n\n```\nd8e7\n```"
