When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Knight, 3 pawns vs Black's Rook, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns. Black is up a queen for a knight, which is a significant material disadvantage for White.\n\n2. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on h3 is attacking White's rook on b8\n- Black's rook on e6 is attacking White's knight on e3\n- Black's rook on f3 is attacking White's pawn on g3\n\n3. King safety:\n- White's king is exposed on g1 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's king is relatively safe on f7\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b8h8 - moving the rook away from attack while maintaining pressure on the h-file\n- e3f5 - moving the knight to a safer square while attacking the rook on e6\n- b2g7 - trying to create counterplay with the pawn\n- g3g4 - pushing the pawn to defend against the rook attack\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- b8h8 seems passive and allows Black to continue attacking\n- e3f5 looks interesting but after Rxf5, White's position remains difficult\n- b2g7 is too slow and doesn't address immediate threats\n- g3g4 is the most forcing move, defending against the rook attack while opening the g-file for White's rook\n\nThe best move appears to be g3g4, as it:\n1) Defends against the immediate threat to the g3 pawn\n2) Opens the g-file for White's rook\n3) Maintains some activity for White's pieces\n4) Doesn't allow Black to simply win material\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
