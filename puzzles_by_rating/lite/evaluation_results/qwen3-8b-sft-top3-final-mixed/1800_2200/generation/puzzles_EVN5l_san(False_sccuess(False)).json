When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a rook and queen; White also has a queen and rook.\n- **King Safety**: Both kings are relatively safe, but Black\u2019s king is on the edge of the board (g8), which could be dangerous if White can open lines.\n- **Threats**:\n  - White\u2019s queen on g4 is eyeing the g7 pawn and potentially threatening mate ideas along the g-file or diagonals.\n  - Black\u2019s queen on h6 is active and can threaten checks or support other pieces.\n- **Black\u2019s Rook on a2** is very active, attacking the rook on a1 (which is currently undefended).\n- **Black\u2019s pawn on c3** is advanced and could promote soon if not stopped.\n- **White\u2019s pawn on e6** is a dangerous passer, supported by the queen.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\n### 1. **a2a1** \u2013 Capturing the rook on a1\n- This wins material immediately.\n- After `a2a1`, White must respond. The rook on a1 is now gone, so this is a strong candidate.\n\n### 2. **h6g6+** \u2013 Checking the king\n- Forces the white king to move.\n- Could lead to tactical complications, but might allow Black to gain tempo or force a better position.\n\n### 3. **c3c2** \u2013 Pushing the passed pawn\n- Very aggressive.\n- Threatens to promote in one move.\n- However, White may have counterplay with the queen or rook.\n\n### 4. **g8h8** \u2013 Moving the king to safety\n- Passive, but avoids potential back-rank issues.\n- Not ideal when you have active pieces and threats.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation:\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be:\n\n### `a2a1`\n\nThis captures a rook without any immediate compensation for White. It gains material and removes a key defender from the board.\n\nAfter `a2a1`, White will likely recapture with the rook (`Ra1`), but Black will still be up material and in a much stronger position.\n\n---\n\n## Final Move:\n\n```\na2a1\n```"
