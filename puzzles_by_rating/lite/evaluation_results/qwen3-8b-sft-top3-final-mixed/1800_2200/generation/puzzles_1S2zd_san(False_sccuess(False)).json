When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's king is exposed on h8 with weak dark squares around it\n3. White has a strong bishop on g5 pinning the f6 knight to the queen\n4. Black's queen on e8 is awkwardly placed, blocking the rook\n5. White's queen on h3 is very active, eyeing the h7 pawn and potential checks\n\nKey observations:\n- The h7 pawn is only defended by the bishop on g7\n- Black's king has no escape squares if we can deliver a check\n- The bishop on g5 is very strong and should be preserved\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h3h7 - immediate queen sacrifice, but after ...Qxh7 we don't have enough follow-up\n2. g5h6 - bishop sacrifice, but after ...gxh6 we don't have a clear attack\n3. g5f6 - bishop takes knight, but after ...Qxf6 we lose our strong bishop\n4. h3e6 - queen move threatening mate on h7, but black can defend with ...Qxe6\n5. g1f3 - developing the knight with tempo on the queen\n\nThe most promising seems to be g1f3:\n- Develops a piece with tempo (attacking the queen)\n- Prepares to bring the rook into the attack via f1\n- Maintains all our attacking options\n- If black takes our knight with ...Qxf3, we recapture with ...exf3 and our attack continues\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't maintain our initiative. g1f3 keeps maximum pressure while improving our position.\n\n```\ng1f3\n```"
