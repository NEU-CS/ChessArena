When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop + 4 pawns vs Black's knight + 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's bishop is very active.\n\n2. King safety: Both kings are exposed, but White's king is slightly safer on c3.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White has passed pawns on a5 and b4\n   - Black has a passed pawn on d6 that could become dangerous\n   - Black's h-pawn is advanced but not immediately threatening\n\n4. Key features:\n   - White's bishop controls important squares near Black's king\n   - Black's knight is somewhat passive on c6\n   - The d5 pawn is weak and could be a target\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- d4h8: Bishop sacrifice to remove Black's h-pawn, but seems premature\n- d4g7: Attacks the f6 pawn, but Black can defend with ...Kf7\n- d4f6: Attacks the e5 pawn, but Black can play ...Kxf6\n- d4e5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the d6 pawn\n- b4b5: Advances the passed pawn, but allows ...axb5\n- a5a6: Advances the passed pawn, but Black can blockade with ...bxa6\n\nAfter considering these, d4e5 seems most promising because:\n1. It centralizes the bishop\n2. It attacks the d6 pawn which is Black's main counterplay\n3. If Black takes with ...dxe5, White recaptures with Kxe5 and the king becomes active\n4. If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with b4-b5 or a5-a6\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black counterplay.\n\n```\nd4e5\n```"
