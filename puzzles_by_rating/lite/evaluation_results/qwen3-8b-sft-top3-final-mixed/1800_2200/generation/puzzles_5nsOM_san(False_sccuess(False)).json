When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Nxe2\n2. Qxe2 Qxg2+\n3. Kxg2 Nxg2+\n4. Kf3 Nxe1\n\nNow Black has won a rook and is up material.\n\nThis looks promising.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Other options:\n- Moving the queen (`g6h6`, `g6f6`, etc.) doesn\u2019t seem as strong unless there's a forced mate or major gain.\n- Moving the rook from h8 (`h8g8`, `h8f8`) is passive.\n- Moving the knight from b4 (`b4c6`, `b4d5`) is less forcing than taking the rook.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe move **...Nxe2** leads to a clear tactical sequence where Black wins material and gains a significant advantage.\n\n---\n\n```\nf4e2\n```"
