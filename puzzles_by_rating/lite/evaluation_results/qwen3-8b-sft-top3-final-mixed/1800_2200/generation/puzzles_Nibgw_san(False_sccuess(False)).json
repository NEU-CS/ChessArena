When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen, rook, knight. Material is equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d4 is very active, eyeing the g7 pawn and potentially the black king.\n- Black's queen on f4 is very dangerous, threatening mate on g2 (Qg2#).\n- White's knight on g5 is well placed but needs to be careful about getting trapped.\n- Black's rook on d8 is controlling the d-file.\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's Qg2# is a mate threat that must be addressed immediately.\n- White's knight on g5 is under attack by Black's pawn on e4.\n\n4. Candidate moves to stop Qg2#:\n- g5h7 - blocks the queen's path to g2 but leaves knight hanging to e4\n- g5f7 - blocks the queen's path to g2 and defends e5\n- d4e3 - blocks the queen's path to g2 while attacking the queen\n- d4f4 - captures the queen but allows Qg2# after Qxf4\n\n5. Best move seems to be g5f7:\n- Blocks the mate threat on g2\n- Defends the e5 square\n- The knight is safe on f7 as Black can't trap it immediately\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nOther options:\n- d4e3 is tempting but after Qxe3, White loses material\n- g5h7 allows Qxh7 and the mate threat remains\n- d4f4 Qxf4 and White is in trouble\n\nAfter g5f7, if Black takes the knight with e4xf7, White can play Qxf4 and the position remains balanced.\n\n```\ng5f7\n```"
