If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully.\n\n### FEN:\n`8/8/8/5pp1/3KNk2/8/8/8 w - - 0 55`\n\nThis is a late endgame with minimal material. White has a king and a knight, while Black has a king and two pawns on the 5th rank (f5 and g5). The key elements to consider:\n\n- **White's king** is on d4.\n- **White's knight** is on e4.\n- **Black's king** is on f4.\n- **Black's pawns** are on f5 and g5 \u2014 both advanced and potentially dangerous if they promote.\n\nThe goal for White is to stop the Black pawns from promoting and ideally win them or force a draw. Since White has a knight, it can help control key squares around the pawns.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n#### 1. `e4f6` \u2013 Knight to f6\n- Attacks g4 and h5.\n- Controls squares around the Black king and pawns.\n- Keeps pressure on the kingside.\n- Good central control.\n\n#### 2. `e4d6` \u2013 Knight to d6\n- Less active; doesn't threaten anything directly.\n- Not ideal in this dynamic position.\n\n#### 3. `e4g5` \u2013 Knight to g5\n- Attacks f3 and h3.\n- Could be useful if trying to triangulate or restrict Black king.\n- But not immediately threatening.\n\n#### 4. `e4c5` \u2013 Knight to c5\n- Too far from the action on the kingside.\n- Not helpful in stopping the pawns.\n\n#### 5. `e4g3` \u2013 Knight to g3\n- Might try to attack f1 or h1 later.\n- Too slow here.\n\n#### 6. `e4c3` \u2013 Knight to c3\n- Again, too far from the critical area.\n\n#### 7. `e4f2` \u2013 Knight to f2\n- Could support a king march.\n- But again, not urgent enough.\n\n#### 8. `e4d2` \u2013 Knight to d2\n- Too passive.\n\n#### 9. `d4d5` \u2013 King to d5\n- Centralizing the king.\n- Could help in supporting the knight or attacking pawns.\n- A solid plan.\n\n#### 10. `d4c5` \u2013 King to c5\n- Too far from the kingside pawns.\n\n#### 11. `d4c4` \u2013 King to c4\n- Also too far from the action.\n\n#### 12. `d4d3` \u2013 King to d3\n- Retreating unnecessarily.\n\n#### 13. `d4c3` \u2013 King to c3\n- Also too far.\n\n---\n\n### Best Plan:\n\nWhite needs to **stop the Black pawns** from advancing. The best way to do that is to **use the knight to control key squares around the pawns**, especially g4 and h5, which are critical for stopping the pawns' advance.\n\nThe move **`e4f6`** does exactly that. It places the knight on a strong outpost where it pressures g4 and h5, and also keeps an eye on the Black king.\n\nIt also prepares for possible triangulation or zugzwang scenarios where White can force Black to make a weakening move.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\ne4f6\n```"
