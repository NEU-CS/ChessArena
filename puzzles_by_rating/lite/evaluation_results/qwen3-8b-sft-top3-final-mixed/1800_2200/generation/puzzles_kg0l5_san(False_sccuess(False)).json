When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen vs White's rook, bishop, queen. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on f7 pinning Black's rook on e7 to the king\n- Black's queen on b6 is very active\n- White's queen on f3 is eyeing the e2 rook\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxe2 winning the rook\n- White could also play Bxe5 winning a pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8: Blocking the pin by moving the rook away\n- b6e6: Attacking the pinned rook while defending e7\n- e2e6: Counterattacking the bishop\n- b6d8: Moving the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- e7e8 seems passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n- b6e6 is interesting but after Qxe6, Black loses material\n- e2e6 looks tempting but after Bxe6, Black's position remains difficult\n- b6d8 seems most solid, getting the queen to safety while maintaining pressure on White's position\n\nThe best move appears to be b6d8, getting the queen to safety while keeping all options open. It prevents any immediate threats and maintains Black's active piece play.\n\n```\nb6d8\n```"
