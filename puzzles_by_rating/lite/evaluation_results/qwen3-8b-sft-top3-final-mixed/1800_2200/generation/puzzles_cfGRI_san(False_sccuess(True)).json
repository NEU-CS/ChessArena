Material is equal, but White has a passed pawn on a5.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rooks are very active on the 7th rank\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black has a rook on a2 attacking White's pawn on a5\n- White's knight on c6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7c8: Rook sacrifice to remove Black's rook from a8\n- c6e7: Knight fork attacking king and rook\n- b7b8: Rook sacrifice to remove Black's rook\n- a5a6: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- c6e7 looks very strong as it forks the king and rook. After Kf8, White can play Rxa8 winning a rook.\n- c7c8 is also good, but after Rxc8 Rxc8, White doesn't have immediate material gain.\n- a5a6 is tempting but Black can play Rxa6 and the pawn is lost.\n\nThe knight fork c6e7 is the most forcing and winning move, as it leads to immediate material gain while maintaining all of White's advantages.\n\n```\nc6e7\n```"
