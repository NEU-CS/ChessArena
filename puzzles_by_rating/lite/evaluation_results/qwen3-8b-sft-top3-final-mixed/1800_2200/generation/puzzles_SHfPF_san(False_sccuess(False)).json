When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and queens)\n2. Black has a strong knight on e4 that's very active\n3. White's bishop on g5 is under attack by Black's bishop on g4\n4. White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n5. Black's queen on a5 is eyeing the a2 pawn\n\nKey considerations:\n- The bishop on g5 is under attack - we need to deal with this\n- We have several ways to defend it: move it, capture the bishop, or block\n- Capturing the bishop with h2xg4 seems tempting but after ...Qxg5 we lose material\n- Moving the bishop to safety (like h4 or f6) maintains our initiative\n- The knight on e4 is a problem - we should consider challenging it\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- g5h4: Defends the bishop while maintaining pressure on f6\n- f3e5: Challenges the strong knight on e4\n- c4d5: Pushes the passed pawn but leaves the bishop hanging\n- e1g1: Castles but doesn't address immediate concerns\n\nThe most forcing and best move appears to be f3e5, challenging the strong knight. After:\n- If Black takes our knight with ...Nxe5, we recapture with dxe5 and our pawn structure improves\n- If Black moves the knight, we maintain pressure\n- This also opens the f-file for our rook\n\nOther options either don't address the knight threat or leave us passive. The bishop can be dealt with later after we've challenged the knight.\n\n```\nf3e5\n```"
