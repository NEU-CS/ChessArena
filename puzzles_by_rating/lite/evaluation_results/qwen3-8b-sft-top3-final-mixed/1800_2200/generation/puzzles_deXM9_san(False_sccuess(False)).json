When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and pawns)\n2. Black has a knight on e4 that's well-placed, but it's pinned to the queen (can't move without losing the queen)\n3. White has a strong bishop on g5 eyeing f6 and e7 squares\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's king is also uncastled but safer\n5. Black has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on e4 is pinned and can't move\n- Black's bishop on d7 is blocked by its own pawn on d6\n- White has potential to open the position with d4-d5\n- The bishop on g5 is very active and can create threats\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5e7 - Bishop sacrifice to open the position\n2. c4f7 - Another bishop sacrifice idea\n3. d4d5 - Pushing the pawn to open the position\n4. e1g1 - Castling to safety\n\nAfter deep consideration:\n- g5e7 looks tempting as it forces fxe7, then d4xe5 opening the position with Black's king still in the center\n- However, after 1...fxe7 2.dxe5 dxe5 3.Bxe5, Black can play 3...Qd6 with counterplay\n- d4d5 is solid but doesn't immediately exploit Black's pin\n- e1g1 is safe but doesn't press the advantage\n\nThe most forcing and promising line is g5e7, sacrificing the bishop to open the position when Black's king is still in the center. Even though Black gets some counterplay with Qd6, White's pieces are better placed to handle it.\n\n```\ng5e7\n```"
