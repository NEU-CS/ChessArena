When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on c2 that's one square from promotion\n- White's king is exposed on a2\n- Black's rook on a4 is very active\n- White has a knight on c5 that's very active\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's c2 pawn is threatening to promote\n- Black could play ...Rxa2 winning the rook\n\n4. Candidate moves to stop the c2 pawn:\n- c3c4 blocks the pawn but allows ...Rxa2\n- e2e4 blocks but allows ...Rxa2\n- a2b3 moves the king but allows ...Rxa2\n- c5d7 forks king and pawn, but after ...Kg7 the knight is trapped\n\n5. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to stop the pawn while maintaining material equality\n- c3c4 seems most forcing, as after ...Rxa2 Rxa4, White can play Rxc2\n\n6. Other considerations:\n- c5e6 looks tempting but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- e2e3 is too passive\n- a2b3 allows ...Rxa2 anyway\n\nAfter careful consideration, c3c4 is the best move as it:\n- Blocks the pawn's advance\n- After ...Rxa2 Rxa4, White can play Rxc2 eliminating the threat\n- Maintains material equality\n- Keeps the knight active on c5\n\n```\nc3c4\n```"
