When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully as Black.\n\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a strong centralized queen on d6 and rook on d1, putting pressure on the d-file.\n2. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover.\n3. Black has a knight on c5 that's well-placed but potentially trapped.\n4. White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous.\n5. Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on f7.\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c5c6 - This looks tempting to challenge White's strong knight, but after Nxc6 bxc6, White's queen gets even more active.\n2. g8f6 - Developing the knight to challenge White's center, but White can play Qxf6.\n3. c7d6 - Trading queens, but this relieves pressure but gives White the bishop pair.\n4. e8d8 - Moving the king to safety, but it's passive.\n5. g7g6 - Creating luft for the king, but weakens the dark squares.\n\nAfter considering these, the most promising seems to be c5c6, despite the drawbacks, because:\n- It challenges White's strong knight\n- After Nxc6 bxc6, Black can play Qd7 to defend the bishop\n- It opens the b-file for potential counterplay\n- It prevents White from playing Nxd7 winning material\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or lead to worse positions. While c5c6 has some risks, it's the most active option that maintains counterplay.\n\n```\nc5c6\n```"
