When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized queen on f4 and rook on e1, putting pressure on Black's position.\n2. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover.\n3. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated, with the rooks on c8 and d8 not connected.\n4. White has a passed pawn on d5 that could become dangerous if not addressed.\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g8h8 - Moving the king to safety, but doesn't address other issues.\n2. e8e7 - Connecting rooks and getting the king off the back rank.\n3. d8e7 - Blocking the e-file and connecting rooks.\n4. c6e5 - Challenging White's strong knight on g5.\n\nAfter considering these:\n- e8e7 looks solid, connecting rooks and getting the king safer.\n- d8e7 is also reasonable but blocks the e-file.\n- c6e5 is tempting but after Nxe5 dxe5, White's queen gets more activity.\n\nThe most principled move seems to be e8e7, which:\n- Connects the rooks\n- Gets the king off the back rank\n- Maintains flexibility\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the main issues or create new problems.\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
