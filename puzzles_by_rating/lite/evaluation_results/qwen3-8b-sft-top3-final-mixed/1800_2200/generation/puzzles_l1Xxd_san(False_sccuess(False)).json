When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: King on g1, Rook on h7, Pawn on g7\n- **Black**: King on e3, Rook on h2, Pawn on d3, Pawn on g3\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White has a rook on the 7th rank (h7), which is very dangerous if supported by the king.\n- Black\u2019s rook is on h2, currently pinning the White king to the back rank.\n- Black has two pawns: one on d3 and one on g3.\n- The Black king is in the center, on e3.\n- The White king is on g1, relatively safe for now.\n\n### Goal for Black:\n- Avoid losing material or getting mated.\n- Try to create counterplay, possibly with the rook or pawns.\n- Be careful of the threat of Rh8# (mate) if the Black king moves away from the e-file.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `e3f4`, `e3e4`, `e3d4`, `e3f3`, `e3e2`, `e3d2` \u2013 all these move the king away from the center and potentially expose it to checks or mating threats.\n\n#### Rook moves:\n- `h2h7` \u2013 captures the rook! But is it safe? After `h2h7`, White plays `g7g8q` and threatens mate on h8. So this is **not safe**.\n- `h2h6`, `h2h5`, `h2h4`, `h2h3` \u2013 moving the rook down the h-file, but doesn't achieve much.\n- `h2g2` \u2013 attacks the g3 pawn, but also allows White to play `Rh8+` and win the rook.\n- `h2f2`, `h2e2`, `h2d2`, `h2c2`, `h2b2`, `h2a2` \u2013 lateral rook moves, mostly passive.\n- `h2h1` \u2013 retreats the rook to h1, keeping pressure on the h-file.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- `g3g2` \u2013 advances the pawn, threatening to promote. This is a strong candidate.\n- `d3d2` \u2013 advances the d-pawn, also a potential threat.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most promising options:\n\n#### `g3g2` \u2013 Pushing the g-pawn:\n- Threatens to promote to a queen on g1.\n- Forces White to respond immediately.\n- If White plays `Rxh2`, then `Kxh2` and Black can try to promote the d-pawn.\n- If White tries to stop the pawn with `Kf2`, then `g1=Q` is coming.\n\nThis move creates immediate counterplay and forces White to react.\n\n#### `d3d2` \u2013 Pushing the d-pawn:\n- Also threatens promotion.\n- But the g-pawn is closer to promotion and more dangerous.\n\n#### `h2h1` \u2013 Retreating the rook:\n- Keeps the rook active and prevents immediate mate on h8.\n- But passive compared to pushing a pawn.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **`g3g2`** \u2013 advancing the pawn to threaten promotion. It forces White to deal with the threat and gives Black the best chance to survive or even win.\n\n```\ng3g2\n```"
