When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong pawn on g6, supported by the bishop on f5\n- Black's king is exposed in the center (e8)\n- White's queen on f4 is very active\n- Black's queen on b6 is under attack by the bishop on f5\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Qxb6 winning the queen\n- White could also play Bxg7 winning a pawn and exposing Black's king further\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6d8: Queen retreat to defend against Qxb6\n- b6c7: Queen moves to defend against Qxb6 while attacking the bishop\n- e8g8: King moves to safety\n- d7f6: Knight moves to block the bishop's diagonal\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- b6c7 seems best as it defends against Qxb6 while attacking the bishop. If White takes the queen with Bxc7, Black can recapture with Rxc7, maintaining material equality.\n- Other queen moves either don't address the threat or leave the king exposed.\n- King moves are too passive and don't solve the immediate problem.\n- Knight moves don't address the queen threat.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nb6c7\n```"
