When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on a4 is very active, eyeing the black king's position\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with weak dark squares around it\n- White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black's bishop on a6 is blocked by its own pawn on d6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a4e8: Queen sacrifice to expose the king\n- c1h6: Bishop sacrifice to open the h-file\n- f3g5: Knight move threatening discovered checks\n- e7e8: Rook promotion (but this seems premature)\n\n4. The most forcing and promising line appears to be a4e8, sacrificing the queen to expose the black king:\n- After a4e8, if black takes with fxe8, then c1h6 is crushing (discovered check and mate threats)\n- Black might try to decline with Qxe8, but then we have Qxe8+ Rxe8, and our rook on e7 is very strong\n\n5. Other moves like c1h6 are also good, but a4e8 seems more forcing and leads to immediate complications that favor white.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\na4e8\n```"
