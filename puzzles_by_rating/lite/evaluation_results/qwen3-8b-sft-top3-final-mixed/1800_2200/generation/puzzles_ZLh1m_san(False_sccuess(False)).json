When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, rook vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h7 is very active, attacking the black rook on f8\n- Black has a strong bishop on d4 pinning the f3 pawn to the king\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n- Black's king is on e8 with some pawn cover\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7h8 (QxR) - wins the exchange but allows ...Bxf3 winning a pawn\n- h7g8 (QxR+) - checks the king, but after ...Kf7 the queen is trapped\n- h7f7 (QxR+) - checks the king, but after ...Kxf7 we lose our active queen\n- h1h6 - brings the rook to a more active position\n- e2e4 - breaks the pin on f3 and opens lines\n\n4. Best options:\n- h7h8 is tempting but gives up the strong queen for a rook\n- e2e4 is solid, breaking the pin and opening the position\n- h1h6 is interesting, preparing to double rooks on the h-file\n\nAfter considering these, e2e4 seems most principled:\n- It breaks the pin immediately\n- Opens the e-file for the rook\n- Prepares to push the f-pawn\n- Maintains all of White's active pieces\n\nThe alternatives either give up material or don't improve our position as much.\n\n```\ne2e4\n```"
