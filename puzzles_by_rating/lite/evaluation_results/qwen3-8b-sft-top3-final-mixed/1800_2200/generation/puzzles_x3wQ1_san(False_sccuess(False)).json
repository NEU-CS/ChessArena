When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a very active queen on h4 attacking g2 and eyeing the h-file\n- Black's bishop on b5 is pinning our knight on d4 to our king\n- Our king is somewhat exposed with the rook on e1 and queen on d1\n- Black has threats like ...Qxg2 or ...Bxd4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4e6: Forking queen and rook, but after ...Qxe6 we lose material\n- d4f5: Attacking the queen, but Qxg2 is still dangerous\n- d1h5: Counterattacking the queen, but Qxg2 remains\n- e1e4: Blocking the queen's path to g2, but allows ...Bxd4\n- d2e4: Blocking with the knight, but Qxg2 is still possible\n\n4. Best defensive move seems to be e1e4:\n- It blocks the queen's path to g2\n- If ...Bxd4, we can recapture with exd4 maintaining material equality\n- It also develops the rook to a more active position\n- Other moves either lose material or allow immediate threats\n\nAfter considering all options, e1e4 seems like the most resilient move that maintains material balance while improving our position.\n\n```\ne1e4\n```"
