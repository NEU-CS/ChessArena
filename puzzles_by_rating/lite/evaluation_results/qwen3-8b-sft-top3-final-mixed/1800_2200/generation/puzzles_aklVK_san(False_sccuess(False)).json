When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong rook on e5 and queen on h5\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- Black's queen is under attack by the rook on e5\n- White has threats like Qxh7 or Qxh8\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- The queen on f6 is attacked by the rook on e5\n- White could play Qxh7 next move if we don't address it\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6g7: Queen moves to g7, defending h7 but still leaves queen exposed\n- f6f8: Queen retreats to f8, but allows Qxh7\n- f6g6: Queen moves to g6, but then Qxg6 is possible\n- f6e7: Queen moves to e7, but then Qxh7 is still possible\n- f6h4: Queen moves to h4, but then Qxh4 is possible\n\n5. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to protect h7 while keeping the queen safe\n- f6g7 seems most logical, as it defends h7 and keeps the queen active\n\nAfter considering all options, f6g7 seems like the best move to defend against immediate threats while maintaining some activity for the queen.\n\n```\nf6g7\n```"
