When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This is very tempting.\n- If White captures with the king (`Kxf2`), then `Rxe1+` follows, winning the rook.\n- Even if White doesn't take, this puts pressure on the king and opens up lines.\n\n#### 3. `e4g3` \u2013 Knight to g3+\n- Another **check**.\n- Knight forks king and rook if White plays `Kxg3`.\n- But White can play `Kh1` or `Kh3`, escaping the fork.\n\n#### 4. `e5h5` \u2013 Rook to h5\n- Threatens mate on h2 if supported.\n- But currently not enough support for a forced win.\n\n#### 5. `c5e3` \u2013 Queen to e3+\n- Check again.\n- Might be less effective than other checks.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Analysis:\n\nLet\u2019s focus on **`c5f2`** \u2013 Queen to f2+.\n\nThis is a **check**, and it looks very strong.\n\nAfter `c5f2`, White must respond.\n\n### Possible Responses:\n- `Kxf2`: King takes queen \u2192 `Rxe1+` wins the rook.\n- `Kh1`: King moves away \u2192 Black can follow up with `Rxe1`, again winning material.\n- `Kh3`: King moves to h3 \u2192 Black can continue pressing with `Rxe1`.\n\nIn all cases, **Black gains material**.\n\nSo, **`c5f2`** is a strong, forcing move that wins material.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n```\nc5f2\n```"
