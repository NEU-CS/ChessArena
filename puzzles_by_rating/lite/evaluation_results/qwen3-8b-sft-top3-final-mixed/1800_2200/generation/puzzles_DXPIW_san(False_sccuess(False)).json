When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on f6 is very active, attacking the rook on e7\n- Black's queen on c5 is eyeing the d6 rook\n- White's rook on d6 is under attack by Black's queen\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g1h2: King moves to safety but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- g1h1: Similar to h2, just moving to the corner\n- g1f1: Moving towards the center but still leaves the rook hanging\n- f6d4: Queen takes queen, but after ...Rxd4 White's position remains complicated\n- d6d4: Rook takes queen, but after ...Rxd4 White's rook is lost\n- d1d4: Rook takes queen with check, forcing the king to move\n\nThe best move appears to be d1d4, which:\n- Wins the queen with check\n- After ...Kf7, White can play Qxc5 winning another queen\n- Even if Black tries ...Ke8, White has Qxc5 with a strong position\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't capitalize on the opportunity to win the queen.\n\n```\nd1d4\n```"
