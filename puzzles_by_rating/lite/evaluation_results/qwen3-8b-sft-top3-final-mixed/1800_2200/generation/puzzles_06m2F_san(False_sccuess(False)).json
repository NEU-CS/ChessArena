When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n3. Black has a passed pawn on f4 that could become dangerous\n4. White's rook on g4 is very active and threatening\n\nThe most critical threats are:\n- White could play Qh7# if we don't address it\n- White could play Rg8+ followed by Qh7#\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h8h7 - moves the king away from potential checks but leaves it exposed\n2. f8g8 - blocks the rook's path to g8 but allows Qh7#\n3. d8e7 - defends h7 but allows Rg8+ winning the queen\n4. f6g5 - blocks the queen's path to h7 but allows Rg8+ Qxg5 Rxg5\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be h8h7, moving the king to safety while keeping options to defend against the threats. Other moves either allow immediate mate or lose material.\n\n```\nh8h7\n```"
