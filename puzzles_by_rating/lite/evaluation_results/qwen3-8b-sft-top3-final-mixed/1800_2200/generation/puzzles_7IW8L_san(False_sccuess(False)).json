When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and rook vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on b4 is very active, eyeing the b2 pawn and potentially threatening Qxb2+\n- White's bishop on d3 is pinned to the king by Black's rook on d8\n- White has a passed pawn on h5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g4: Attacks the pinned bishop, but allows Qxb2+\n- d3b5: Unpins the bishop and attacks the rook, but Qxb2+ is still possible\n- g1g4: Prepares to double rooks on the g-file, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e1e4: Centralizes the king and connects rooks, but allows Qxb2+\n- h5h6: Advances the passed pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\nWe need to prevent Qxb2+ while maintaining our activity. The move d3b5 seems most promising because:\n- It unpins the bishop\n- It attacks the rook on d8\n- If Black takes our bishop with Qxb5, we can recapture with axb5, opening the a-file for our rook\n- It maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves either allow Qxb2+ or don't address the pin effectively.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is:\n\n```\nd3b5\n```"
