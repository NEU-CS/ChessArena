When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a pawn (White has Q+N+B vs Black's R+R+B). However, White's pieces are very active.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on f6 is attacking the rook on f8\n- White's knight on g5 is threatening to jump to e6 or f7\n- White's bishop on b3 is eyeing the a4 pawn\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has potential mating threats with queen and knight coordination\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8e8 - moving the rook away from attack\n- b4e7 - blocking the queen's attack on the rook while developing the bishop\n- b4d6 - attacking the queen while developing the bishop\n- h7h6 - trying to kick the knight\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- f8e8 seems passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n- b4d6 looks interesting as it attacks the queen while developing, but Qxd6 would be bad for Black\n- b4e7 is solid, blocking the queen's attack on the rook while developing the bishop to a good diagonal\n- h7h6 is too slow and doesn't address the immediate threats\n\nThe best move appears to be b4e7, as it:\n1. Blocks the queen's attack on the rook\n2. Develops the bishop to a strong diagonal\n3. Maintains material equality\n4. Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\n```\nb4e7\n```"
