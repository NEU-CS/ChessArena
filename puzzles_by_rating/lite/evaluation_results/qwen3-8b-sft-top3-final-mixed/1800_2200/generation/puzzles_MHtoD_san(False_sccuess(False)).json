When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Bishop, King, 3 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Queen, King, 2 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs no minor pieces)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen is very active on h5, eyeing the black king\n   - Black's king is exposed on f7\n   - White has a passed pawn on d4\n   - Black's rook on d8 is blocked by its own pawn on b7\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - f7f8: King moves to f8 - gets away from queen's attack but very passive\n   - f7e7: King moves to e7 - still exposed to queen checks\n   - f7e6: King moves to e6 - walks into potential discovered checks\n   - g8g6: Rook moves to g6 - blocks queen's attack on king while activating rook\n\n4. Evaluating g8g6:\n   - Immediately blocks the queen's attack on the king\n   - Activates the rook to a more active position\n   - Prepares potential rook lifts (Rg6-g1)\n   - Maintains control over the g-file\n   - Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\n5. Other moves:\n   - King moves all leave the king exposed to checks\n   - f7e6 is particularly dangerous as it allows Bf4+ with discovered checks\n\nThe best move is clearly g8g6 as it solves the immediate threat while improving Black's piece activity.\n\n```\ng8g6\n```"
