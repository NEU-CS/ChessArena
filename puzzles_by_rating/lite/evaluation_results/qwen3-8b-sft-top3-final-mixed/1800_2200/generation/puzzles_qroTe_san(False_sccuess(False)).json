When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's bishop is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed and needs to find safety\n- Black's knight is currently blocking the f7 square\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on e2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7h8: Knight moves to h8, but this seems passive\n- f7d8: Knight moves to d8, but this blocks the d-file\n- d6d7: King moves forward, but exposes to checks\n- d6c7: King moves towards the queenside\n- e4e3: Pawn push, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h7h5: Pawn push, but doesn't help much\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6c7:\n- Gets the king to relative safety\n- Prepares to support the a-pawn's advance\n- Avoids potential checks from White's bishop\n- Keeps options open for the knight\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or make the position worse. The king needs to find safety while maintaining counterplay with the a-pawn.\n\n```\nd6c7\n```"
