When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (king + pawns). White has pawns on a3, b2, d3, g5, h4. Black has pawns on a4, b5, c5, g6, h5.\n\n2. King activity: Black's king is more active in the center (d6) while White's king is somewhat restricted by its own pawns.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - White's pawns are more advanced but somewhat disconnected.\n   - Black has a passed pawn on c5 that could become dangerous.\n   - The h-pawns are locked (h4 vs h5).\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - King moves: d6e7, d6d7, d6c7, d6e6, d6c6, d6e5, d6d5\n   - Pawn moves: c5c4, b5b4\n\n5. Key observations:\n   - The c5 pawn is passed and could be pushed to c4 to create more space.\n   - The b5 pawn can also be pushed to b4, but this might weaken the pawn structure.\n   - The king should stay active in the center to support the pawns.\n\n6. Best plan:\n   - Push the c-pawn to c4 to create a passed pawn and gain space.\n   - This also prevents White from playing d3-d4 to block the c-pawn.\n   - The king can then support the c-pawn's advance.\n\nAfter considering all options, the most promising move is to push the c-pawn:\n\n```\nc5c4\n```"
