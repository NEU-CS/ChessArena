When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, queen, bishop, knight vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight). \n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h6, which is very dangerous. White has threats like Qxg5 or Rg6+.\n\n3. Immediate threats: \n   - White's queen on e3 is eyeing g5 (attacking the bishop)\n   - White's rook on g3 could swing to g6 with check\n   - White's pawn on e5 is cramping Black's position\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - h6h7: Moves king away from immediate threats but still leaves it exposed\n   - h6g7: Gets king to slightly safer square but still vulnerable\n   - h6h5: Moves king forward into more danger\n   - e4g5: Captures the bishop but opens up the position further\n\n5. Best choice: e4g5 is forced because:\n   - If we don't take the bishop, White will take it next move (Qxg5)\n   - After e4g5, we can try to activate our pieces\n   - Other king moves leave us in serious danger from checks\n\nThe position is very difficult for Black, but e4g5 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose material or get mated.\n\n```\ne4g5\n```"
