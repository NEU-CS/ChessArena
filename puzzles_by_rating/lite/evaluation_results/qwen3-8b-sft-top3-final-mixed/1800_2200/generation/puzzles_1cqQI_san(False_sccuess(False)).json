When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and pawn (White has Rook + Queen + Knight vs Black's Rook + Bishop). However, Black has some compensation with the active bishop and queen.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e3 is very active, eyeing the g1 square\n- Black's bishop on g2 is pinning the knight on g3 to the king\n- Black's queen on h2 is threatening the rook on h1\n- White's rook on d7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h2h1: Capturing the rook immediately, but after Qxh1, Black's position remains difficult\n- g2h1: Blocking with the bishop, but White can play Qxh1\n- g2f3: Developing the bishop to a more active square while maintaining the pin\n- h7h5: Creating some luft for the king and potentially preparing ...h4 to challenge White's center\n\n4. Best move seems to be g2f3:\n- Maintains the pin on the knight\n- Develops the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- Keeps options open for both defense and counterplay\n- Prevents White from playing f4 to strengthen their center\n\nOther moves either lose material immediately or don't improve Black's position. The bishop move is the most flexible and maintains some defensive resources while keeping the initiative.\n\n```\ng2f3\n```"
