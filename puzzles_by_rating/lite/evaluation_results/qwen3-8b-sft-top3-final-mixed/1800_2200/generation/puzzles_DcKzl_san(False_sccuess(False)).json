When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a queen on d2 and rook on c2, but they're not well coordinated.\n3. White has a passed pawn on f5 that could become dangerous.\n4. Black's pawn structure is somewhat compromised with isolated pawns.\n\nThe most critical threats:\n- White could play Qb4-d6+ next move, forking king and rook\n- White could also play Rg3-g8+ winning the rook\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g8f8 - moves king away from immediate threats but still leaves it exposed\n2. d2d8 - blocks the queen's diagonal but allows Qb4-d6+ winning the rook\n3. c2c8 - protects the rook but allows Qb4-d6+ winning the queen\n4. c2f5 - trades queens but leaves Black down material after Rxf5\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be g8f8, moving the king to relative safety while keeping all pieces defended. Other moves either lose material or leave the king in danger.\n\n```\ng8f8\n```"
