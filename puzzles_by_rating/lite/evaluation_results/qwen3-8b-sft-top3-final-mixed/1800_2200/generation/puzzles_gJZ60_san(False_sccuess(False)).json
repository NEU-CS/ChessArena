When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong knight on g4 attacking f2 and eyeing e3\n3. Black's queen on d6 is very active, eyeing the b4 square and potentially threatening Qxb4+\n4. White's knight on d4 is very strong, but needs to be careful about potential forks\n5. Black's rook on f6 is also active, potentially eyeing f2\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to deal with the threat to f2 (from Ng4)\n- Need to consider potential knight forks (like Nxe6+)\n- Need to maintain control of the center\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f3g5 - attacks the rook on f6, but after ...Rxg5 we lose material\n2. d4e6 - fork attempt, but after ...fxe6 we don't get enough\n3. d1a4 - pins the pawn on b5, but doesn't address immediate threats\n4. f3e5 - blocks the queen's diagonal and defends f2, looks solid\n5. g1h1 - moves the king away from potential checks, but passive\n\nAfter considering these, f3e5 seems most principled:\n- Blocks the queen's diagonal to b4\n- Defends f2 against the knight\n- Maintains control of the center\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. The position remains complex, but f3e5 gives White the best chances to maintain equality and look for counterplay.\n\n```\nf3e5\n```"
