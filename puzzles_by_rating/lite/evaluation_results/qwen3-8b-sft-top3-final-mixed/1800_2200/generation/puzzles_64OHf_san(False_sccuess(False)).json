When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n3. White has a strong knight on e4 that's very active\n4. Black's queen on f8 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n5. White's rook on f1 is well placed to potentially double on the f-file\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) Knight moves:\n- e4f6 looks tempting as it forks the queen and rook, but after ...Qxf6 White doesn't get enough compensation\n- e4d6 is interesting, attacking the bishop and threatening to jump to f7 with check\n- e4g5 threatens to jump to f7 with check, but Black can defend with ...Qg7\n\nB) Bishop moves:\n- c4e6 is strong, attacking the queen and threatening to win material\n- c4a6 is less effective as it doesn't create immediate threats\n\nC) Queen moves:\n- g3g7 is very tempting as it threatens mate on h7 and attacks the rook on f8\n- Other queen moves don't create immediate threats\n\nAfter considering these options, g3g7 seems the most forcing and dangerous move:\n1. It threatens Qxh7# which is mate\n2. Black's only way to prevent mate is to play ...Qxg7, but then we have Nf6+ winning the queen back\n3. Even if Black finds ...Qg8, we have Nxg8 Kxg8 and our bishop on c4 is very strong\n\nOther moves like c4e6 are good but not as immediately decisive. The knight moves don't create the same level of threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3g7\n```"
