When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong centralized queen on e4 and rook on a5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active, pinning the knight on g3\n- White's knight on g3 is pinned and can't move without losing the queen\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg4 winning a piece\n- White could also play Rxa7 winning a pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4e6: Bishop moves to e6, attacking the queen while maintaining the pin\n- g4h5: Bishop moves to h5, keeping pressure on g3\n- g6h6: Rook moves to h6, defending against Qxg4\n- e7f6: Queen moves to f6, defending g7 and attacking e4\n\nAfter considering these options, g4e6 seems strongest because:\n- It maintains the pin on the knight\n- It attacks White's queen\n- It develops the bishop to a more active square\n- It prevents Qxg4 by controlling e6\n- It keeps options open for both defense and counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or are less active. For example, g6h6 would just defend against Qxg4 but be passive, while e7f6 would block the f-pawn's advance.\n\n```\ng4e6\n```"
