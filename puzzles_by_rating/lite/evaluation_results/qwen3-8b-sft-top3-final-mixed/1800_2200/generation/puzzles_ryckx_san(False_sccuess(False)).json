When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (rook \u2248 knight + bishop), but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook is very active on f6, eyeing the f2 pawn\n- White's knight on c6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- White's bishop on g2 is blocked by its own pawn on g3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Knight moves: c6d8 looks tempting as it forks the king and rook\n- Bishop moves: g2d5 looks interesting, attacking the rook\n- King moves: d2c3 to get closer to the action\n- Pawn moves: g3f4 to open lines for the bishop\n\n4. Calculating c6d8:\n- After c6d8, Black must take with rook: f6d8\n- Then we can play g2d5, attacking the rook again\n- Black would likely play f8d8 to defend\n- Then we can play d2c3, bringing the king closer\nThis seems promising as we maintain pressure.\n\n5. Other options:\n- g2d5 immediately allows f6d5, and we don't have a clear follow-up\n- c6e7 looks less forcing and allows Black to consolidate\n- King moves are too slow\n\nAfter careful consideration, c6d8 seems the most forcing and promising move, creating immediate threats that Black must respond to.\n\n```\nc6d8\n```"
