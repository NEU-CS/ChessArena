When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed e-pawn which is very dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's e6 pawn is passed and close to promotion\n- Black's king is on b7, somewhat exposed\n- Black's a-pawn is advanced but blockaded by White's b4 pawn\n- White's rook is very active on f8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6e7: Pushing the passed pawn immediately\n- Rook moves: f8h8 looks tempting to attack the h5 pawn\n- King moves: g3h4 to get closer to the action\n\n4. Critical lines:\n- After e6e7, Black can play Kc7 attacking the pawn. Then White can play Rf7+ forcing the king to move, but Black can defend with Ra1.\n- f8h8 looks strong as it threatens to win the h5 pawn. After f8h8, if Black plays Ra1, then Rh7 wins the f5 pawn next.\n- g3h4 brings the king closer but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n5. Best continuation seems to be f8h8, attacking the h5 pawn. Black has no good way to defend both the h5 pawn and the f5 pawn. After f8h8, if Black plays Ra1, then Rh7 wins the f5 pawn, and White can then push the e-pawn with tempo.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nf8h8\n```"
