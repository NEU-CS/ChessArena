When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on g7 is very active, attacking the black king on e7\n- Black's queen on c3 is threatening White's rook on g7\n- White's bishop on e3 is pinned to the king by Black's bishop on f6\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7g8: Rook sacrifice to remove the defender of the black king\n- e3h6: Bishop move to attack the rook on f8\n- f1f7: Rook move to attack the black king\n- d3a6: Bishop move to attack the rook on a8\n\n4. Deep analysis:\n- g7g8 looks tempting as it removes the defender of the black king, but after ...Kxg8 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- e3h6 is interesting but after ...Qxh6 White loses material\n- f1f7 is strong as it attacks the king and forces ...Kd8, after which White can play Qe4+ winning the queen\n- d3a6 is less forcing and allows Black counterplay\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is f1f7, which leads to a forced sequence winning Black's queen:\n\n1. f1f7 Kd8 (forced, as Kxf7 loses to Qe4+)\n2. Qe4+ Kc8 (only move)\n3. Qxc6+ Kb8\n4. Qxa8 and White is up a full rook\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf1f7\n```"
