When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a rook, bishop, knight, pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen, pawns). Black's queen is more active than White's.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a very active queen on h4 attacking g2 and h2\n- White's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- Black has threats like ...Qxg2 or ...Qh1+\n- White's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3h5: Bishop checks the king, but after ...Kg7 it doesn't solve our problems\n- f3d5: Centralizes the bishop but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d1a4: Queen moves to a4, attacking the b5 bishop but allows ...Qxg2\n- d1e2: Defends g2 but looks passive\n- b1c1: Rook moves to c1, defending the c4 pawn but doesn't help with defense\n- g2g3: Pushes the pawn to block the queen's diagonal\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\nWe need to prevent Qxg2 while maintaining some counterplay. g2g3 seems most logical as it:\n- Blocks the queen's diagonal\n- Creates a luft for the king\n- Prepares to bring the rook to g1 if needed\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. While it's a bit passive, it's the most solid choice in this difficult position.\n\n```\ng2g3\n```"
