When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on d5\n- Black's queen is very active on b6, eyeing the b2 pawn\n- White's rook on d1 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxb6 next move, winning the queen\n- White could also play Qxf5, winning a pawn with tempo\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 (king safety)\n- f8f7 (blocking the queen's diagonal)\n- b6d8 (queen retreat)\n- g7e6 (knight move attacking the queen)\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- g8h8 is too passive and doesn't address the immediate threats\n- f8f7 blocks the queen's diagonal but allows Qxf5\n- b6d8 is safe but gives up the strong queen position\n- g7e6 is the most active, attacking the queen while developing the knight\n\nThe best move is g7e6, as it:\n- Attacks the queen\n- Develops the knight to a better square\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White\n\n```\ng7e6\n```"
