When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook, queen, pawn vs White's rook, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed h-pawn that's very advanced.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's h6 pawn is threatening to promote (h6-h7-h8)\n- White's queen on f5 is eyeing the g6 pawn\n- White's knight on e7 is very active\n\n3. Black's options:\n- The rook on f8 is under attack from White's queen\n- The queen on e5 is somewhat exposed\n- The rook on h1 is passive\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8g8: Gets the rook out of attack but doesn't address other threats\n- e5g7: Blocks the h-pawn's promotion path while attacking the knight\n- e5f6: Attacks the queen while defending g6\n- h1h6: Directly challenges the h-pawn\n\nAfter considering these:\n- e5g7 looks tempting as it blocks the pawn, but after Qxg7, Black loses material\n- e5f6 is interesting but Qxf6 gxf6 allows h7 with a strong passed pawn\n- h1h6 is the most forcing move, directly challenging the dangerous pawn\n\nThe best move is to capture the h6 pawn immediately with the rook, eliminating White's most dangerous threat:\n\n```\nh1h6\n```"
