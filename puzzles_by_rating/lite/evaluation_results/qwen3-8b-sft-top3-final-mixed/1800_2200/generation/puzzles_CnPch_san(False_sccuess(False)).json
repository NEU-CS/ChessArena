When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, knight, pawns vs Black's queen, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7 with limited pawn cover\n- White's queen is very active on e7\n- Black's queen on b1 is not very active\n- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...Qb1xh1 winning the h-pawn\n- White can create threats against Black's king\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: e7f8+ forces the king to move (only legal reply is Kg7-h7)\n- Knight moves: d4e6+ forks king and queen, but after ...Kg7xe6, White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- Pawn moves: h4h5 advances the passed pawn but doesn't create immediate threats\n\n5. Best move seems to be e7f8+:\n- Forces the king to h7\n- Then White can play Qf7+ forcing Kh8\n- Then Qf7xg7 is mate (since the knight on h6 blocks escape squares)\n\nHere's the move sequence:\n1. Qf8+ Kh7\n2. Qf7+ Kh8\n3. Qxg7#\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to defend. The queen check is the most forcing and leads to a forced mate.\n\n```\ne7f8\n```"
