When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on a6 is attacking the rook on d7\n- White's bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's passed pawn on d6 is dangerous\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has potential mating threats with rook and queen coordination\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7h7: Moving the rook to defend against the queen\n- f6f8: Moving the queen to a safer square\n- e6f7: Blocking with the bishop\n- g5g4: Pushing the pawn to create some counterplay\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d7h7 looks tempting but after Qxh7, Black's position collapses\n- f6f8 allows Qxf8 winning the rook\n- e6f7 blocks but allows Qxd7 winning material\n- g5g4 is the most resilient, creating some counterplay and preventing immediate disasters\n\nThe best practical chance is to push the pawn and hope White makes a mistake, rather than lose material immediately.\n\n```\ng5g4\n```"
