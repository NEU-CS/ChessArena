When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a strong knight on d4 attacking the rook on e3\n- Black's queen on d5 is very active\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n- Black has a passed pawn on f4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- The knight on d4 is attacking the rook on e3\n- Black could play ...Qd2+ next move if we don't address it\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3e4: Capturing the knight, but after ...Qxe4+ we lose material\n- d1d4: Capturing the knight with the queen, but after ...Qxd4+ we lose the queen\n- e3f3: Moving the rook away from attack, but allows ...Qd2+ next\n- d1f3: Blocking with the queen, but allows ...Qxf3+\n- f1e1: Blocking the queen's diagonal, but doesn't solve the rook issue\n- d1g4: Moving the queen to safety while attacking the rook on g5\n\nAfter considering these options, the best move appears to be d1g4, which:\n- Gets the queen to safety\n- Attacks the rook on g5\n- Prevents ...Qd2+ by controlling that diagonal\n- Maintains pressure on black's position\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow dangerous checks. While d1g4 doesn't solve the rook issue immediately, it's the most forcing and active option.\n\n```\nd1g4\n```"
