When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop + pawns vs Black's bishop + pawns. Material is equal, but White has a more active bishop.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop is very active on c7, controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h3\n- Black has a passed pawn on h4 that could become dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on a4 that's blocked by Black's a5 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: c7d8 (threatening to promote), c7b6 (attacking a5 pawn)\n- King moves: f1f2 (getting closer to center), f1e2 (centralizing)\n- Pawn moves: b3b4 (advancing queenside pawn)\n\n4. Best options:\n- c7d8 is tempting as it threatens to promote, but Black can simply take with the bishop (Bxd8)\n- c7b6 is strong as it attacks the a5 pawn while keeping the bishop active\n- f1e2 is solid, bringing the king toward the center\n\nAfter considering these, c7b6 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the a5 pawn\n- Maintains bishop activity\n- Prepares potential future checks on the a5-b6 diagonal\n- Doesn't allow Black any counterplay\n\nThe other moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black counterplay.\n\n```\nc7b6\n```"
