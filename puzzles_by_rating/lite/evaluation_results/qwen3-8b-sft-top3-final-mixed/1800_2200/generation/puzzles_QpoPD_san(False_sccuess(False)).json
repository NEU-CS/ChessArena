When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. White is up a queen for a rook, which is a decisive material advantage.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active, attacking the rook on h6 and threatening the bishop on d6.\n- Black's king is exposed on b8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a passed pawn on b5 that could become dangerous.\n- Black's rook on h8 is awkwardly placed.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6g8: Queen takes rook with check, but after ...Kxg8 White doesn't have an immediate follow-up.\n- e6e8: Queen takes rook, but this allows Black to play ...Bxe8 and the advantage is reduced.\n- e6f7: Threatening mate on f8, but Black can defend with ...Rxf7.\n- e6d7: Attacking the bishop while maintaining pressure.\n- g3h5: Developing the knight with tempo on the rook.\n\n4. Best move appears to be e6g8:\n- It wins the exchange (queen for rook) with check.\n- After 1...Kxg8, White can play 2. Qxh6+ Kg7 3. Qh5+ Kf7 4. Qh7+ Ke6 5. Qh6+ Ke7 6. Qh5+ Kd7 7. Qh7+ Kc7 8. Qh6+ Kb7 9. Qh7+ Ka7 10. Qh6+ Kb8 11. Qh7+ Kc8 12. Qh6+ Kd8 13. Qh7+ Ke8 14. Qh6+ Kf8 15. Qh7+ Kg8 16. Qh6+ Kh8 17. Qh7+ Kg8 - but this is too long.\n- Actually, after 1...Kxg8 2. Qxh6+ Kg7 3. Qh5+ Kf7 4. Qh7+ Ke6 5. Qh6+ Ke7 6. Qh7+ Kd7 7. Qh6+ Kb7 8. Qh7+ Ka7 9. Qh6+ Kb8 10. Qh7+ Kc8 11. Qh6+ Kd8 12. Qh7+ Ke8 13. Qh6+ Kf8 14. Qh7+ Kg8 15. Qh6+ Kh8 16. Qh7+ Kg8 - it's a perpetual check!\n- Therefore, e6g8 is not the best as it leads to a draw.\n\n5. Better move is e6d7:\n- Attacks the bishop on d6\n- If 1...Bxd7 2. Qxd7+ Kc8 3. Qxd6+ Kb8 4. Qd8+ Ka7 5. Qd7+ Kb8 6. Qd8+ Ka7 - but this is also a draw.\n- If 1...Ke7 2. Qxd6+ Kf8 3. Qd8+ Ke7 4. Qd7+ Kf8 - again a draw.\n\n6. Best move is actually g3h5:\n- Attacks the rook on h6\n- If 1...Rxh5 2. Qxh5+ Kg7 3. Qh7+ Kf6 4. Qh6+ Ke7 5. Qh7+ Kd8 6. Qh6+ Kc8 7. Qh7+ Kb8 8. Qh6+ Ka7 9. Qh7+ Kb8 - again a draw.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to play e6g8 and accept the perpetual check, as all other moves either lead to immediate draws or give up the material advantage. The perpetual check is the most forcing continuation.\n\n```\ne6g8\n```"
