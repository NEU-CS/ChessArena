When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong knight on g4 attacking f2 and eyeing e3\n3. Black's bishop on d6 is very active, controlling key squares\n4. White's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n5. Black has threats like ...Qd7 or ...Rf8 with ideas of doubling rooks on the f-file\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the knight on g4 threat\n- Need to develop pieces or improve king safety\n- Need to consider counterplay against Black's strong bishop\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f3g5 - attacks the knight but allows ...Nxg5 with complications\n2. d2a5 - bishop move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n3. b2h8 - rook move, but seems too passive\n4. b1c3 - develops knight and defends e4, but allows ...Nxe3\n5. f1f2 - defends against the knight, but seems passive\n6. d2c3 - bishop move, but blocks the c-pawn\n\nBest move seems to be f3g5:\n- Forces the knight to move or be captured\n- If ...Nxg5, then hxg5 and we've eliminated the strong knight\n- If ...Nf6, we've gained time and can consider other moves\n- Maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. f3g5 is the most active way to deal with Black's initiative.\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
