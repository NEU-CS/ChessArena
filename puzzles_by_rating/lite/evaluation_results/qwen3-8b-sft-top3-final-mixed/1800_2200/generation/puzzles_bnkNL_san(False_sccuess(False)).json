When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized queen on h5 attacking the knight on e5\n3. Black's king is exposed on g7 with limited pawn cover\n4. White's bishop on c4 is very active, eyeing the f7 pawn\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\nKey threats/considerations:\n- White could play Qxh7+ winning the rook if we don't defend\n- The knight on e5 is under attack by the queen\n- We need to address the immediate threats while improving our position\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5f7 - blocking the queen's path to h7 while developing the knight\n   - But after Qxf7, we lose material\n2. g7f8 - moving the king to safety\n   - But this seems passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n3. e5g6 - moving the knight to safety while attacking the queen\n   - After Qxg6, we lose the knight\n4. c8f8 - developing the rook to defend the f7 pawn\n   - This seems solid, defending against Qxh7+ and preparing to connect rooks\n\nAfter considering these options, c8f8 seems most prudent as it:\n- Defends against the immediate threat of Qxh7+\n- Develops a piece\n- Maintains material equality\n- Keeps options open for future play\n\nOther moves either lose material or are too passive. While e5f7 looks tempting to block the queen, it leads to material loss after Qxf7.\n\n```\nc8f8\n```"
