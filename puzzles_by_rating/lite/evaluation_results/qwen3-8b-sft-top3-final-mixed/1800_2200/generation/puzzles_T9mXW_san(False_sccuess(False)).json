When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

If they recapture with the queen (`e3f5`), then Black can play `d8d7` or `h7h6` to improve coordination.\n- This seems like a solid tactical choice.\n\n#### 2. `e6e8` \u2013 Queen retreats to defend\n- Passive; not ideal when you have an opportunity to win material.\n\n#### 3. `h7h6` \u2013 Prevents Ng7+\n- A prophylactic move, but doesn\u2019t do much else.\n- Might be useful later, but not urgent now.\n\n#### 4. `f8g7` \u2013 Bishop develops\n- Develops a piece, but allows White to play `Ng7+` with check.\n- Not ideal unless you're ready to deal with that.\n\n#### 5. `d8d7` \u2013 Rook defends e7\n- Solid, but passive.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move:\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move here is:\n\n```\ne6f5\n```\n\nThis captures a piece (the knight on f5) and removes a key attacker from the board. It also opens lines for Black\u2019s rooks and gives White a problem to solve.\n\n---\n\n```\ne6f5\n```"
