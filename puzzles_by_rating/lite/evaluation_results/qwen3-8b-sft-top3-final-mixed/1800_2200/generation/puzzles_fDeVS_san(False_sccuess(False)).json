When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: King on f4, Bishop on c4, pawns on e6, f5\n- **Black**: King on e7, Knight on c5, pawns on a7, b6, h5\n\n### Goals for Black:\n- Avoid losing\n- Try to create counterplay or force a draw\n- Be cautious of White's passed pawns (e6 and f5), especially since White's king is active.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `e7-f8`, `e7-e8`, `e7-d8`: Centralizing or moving toward the center.\n- `e7-f6`, `e7-d6`: Approaching the center or supporting potential pawn breaks.\n\n#### Knight moves:\n- `c5-d7`, `c5-b7`, `c5-e6`, `c5-a6`, `c5-e4`, `c5-a4`, `c5-d3`, `c5-b3`: Various knight maneuvers, some trying to attack or support pawns.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- `a7-a6`, `a7-a5`: Trying to create space or prevent White from advancing.\n- `b6-b5`: A pawn break that could be useful.\n- `h5-h4`: Pushing the h-pawn, possibly to create a passed pawn or distract White.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe key idea here is that **Black needs to activate the king and/or knight** to prevent White from promoting their pawns. The most immediate threat is White's **e6 pawn**, which is very advanced and supported by the bishop.\n\nA good plan for Black would be to:\n- Use the knight to control key squares around the e6 pawn.\n- Possibly play `...b5` to challenge White's central control.\n- Keep the king centralized.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some candidate moves more closely:\n\n#### 1. `c5-e6` \u2013 Knight takes on e6\n- This removes White's most dangerous pawn.\n- After `c5-e6`, White can recapture with the bishop: `Bxe6`, but then Black gains tempo and removes a dangerous passer.\n- This seems like a strong practical choice.\n\n#### 2. `c5-d7` \u2013 Knight retreats to support king\n- Less aggressive; doesn't address the e6 pawn threat directly.\n\n#### 3. `b6-b5` \u2013 Pawn break\n- Could open lines and give Black counterplay.\n- But leaves the e6 pawn untouched, which is dangerous.\n\n#### 4. `e7-d6` \u2013 King approaches center\n- Good king activity, but again, doesn't deal with e6.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n\nTaking on e6 with the knight (`c5-e6`) is the most forcing and effective way to reduce White's winning chances. It eliminates a dangerous passer and gives Black better chances to hold or even turn the game around.\n\n---\n\n```\nc5e6\n```"
