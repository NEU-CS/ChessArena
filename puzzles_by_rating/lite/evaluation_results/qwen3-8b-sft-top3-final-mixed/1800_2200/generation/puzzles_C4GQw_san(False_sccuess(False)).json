When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's bishop on f5 is very active, pinning our knight on f3 to the queen\n4. Black has threats like ...Bxf3 or ...Nxf3+\n5. Our king is still in the center which is dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is that Black can capture our knight with Bxf3 or Nxf3+\n- We need to address this threat while maintaining our position\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f3g5 - moves the knight away but leaves the queen hanging to Bxf3\n2. e2b5 - develops the bishop but doesn't solve the immediate threat\n3. e2e4 - blocks the bishop's diagonal but allows ...Bxe4\n4. e1d2 - moves the king to safety but seems too passive\n5. c2f5 - sacrifices the bishop to remove the dangerous black bishop\n\nAfter careful consideration, c2f5 seems best because:\n- It removes Black's very active bishop\n- After Bxf5, we can play Qxf5 and our position becomes more comfortable\n- It opens the c-file for our rook\n- It maintains material equality while reducing Black's attacking potential\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or lead to worse positions. While c2f5 is a bishop sacrifice, it's the most forcing way to improve our position.\n\n```\nc2f5\n```"
