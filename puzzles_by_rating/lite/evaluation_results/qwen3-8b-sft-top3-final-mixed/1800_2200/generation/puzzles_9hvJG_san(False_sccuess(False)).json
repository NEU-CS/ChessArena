When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a knight on g4 attacking our bishop on g5\n3. Black's queen on b6 is eyeing our undefended rook on f1\n4. Our bishop on g5 is very active but needs to be dealt with\n5. Black has castling rights (kq) while we have already castled\n\nKey observations:\n- The bishop on g5 is under attack by the knight on g4\n- We have several options for the bishop: retreat, capture, or sacrifice\n- The most forcing move is g5d8, sacrificing the bishop to expose Black's king\n\nLet's evaluate g5d8:\n- After g5d8, Black must recapture with the queen (b6d8)\n- Then we can play f1f7+ forking the king and queen\n- Black's king would have to move (likely to e7)\n- Then we can take the queen with our bishop (d8d7)\n- This leads to a favorable endgame with rook and bishop vs rook and knight\n\nOther options:\n- Retreating the bishop (g5h6/g5f6) allows Black to play Qxf2+ winning material\n- Capturing the knight (g5xg4) allows Black to play Qxg4 with a strong attack\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threat to the bishop\n\nThe sacrifice g5d8 leads to a concrete advantage, so it's the best choice.\n\n```\ng5d8\n```"
