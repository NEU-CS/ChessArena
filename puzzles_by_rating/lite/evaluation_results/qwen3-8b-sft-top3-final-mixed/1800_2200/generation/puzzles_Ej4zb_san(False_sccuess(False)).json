If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully as Black.\n\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a very active queen on h7, threatening mate on g7 (Qxg7#)\n2. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n3. Black has a knight on a1 that's trapped and will be lost\n4. White has a passed pawn on d4 and active pieces\n5. Black's rook on g8 is under attack by the queen\n\nThe immediate threat is Qxg7#, so we must address this first. Let's examine the candidate moves:\n\n1. g8g7 - blocks the queen's path to g7, but after Qxg7+ Kxg7, we lose the rook for nothing\n2. e8f8 - moves the king away, but Qxg7 is still mate\n3. e8d7 - similar problem, Qxg7 is mate\n4. e7g6 - blocks with the knight, but after Qxg6+ Kxg6, we lose the knight for nothing\n5. d8d7 - blocks with the queen, but Qxd7+ wins the queen\n\nThe only move that prevents immediate mate is g8g7, sacrificing the rook to block the queen's path. After Qxg7+ Kxg7, we're down material but at least not mated immediately. Other moves lead to immediate checkmate.\n\nWhile the position remains difficult after g8g7, it's the only move that doesn't lose immediately. We'll have to fight on from there.\n\n```\ng8g7\n```"
