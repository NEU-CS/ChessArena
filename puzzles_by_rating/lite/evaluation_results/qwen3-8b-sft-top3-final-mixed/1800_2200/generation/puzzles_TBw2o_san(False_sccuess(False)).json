When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized position with rook on e5 and knight on g4\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 pawn\n5. Black's rook on c8 is passive and needs activation\n\nKey observations:\n- White threatens to play Qxg7 winning a pawn\n- Black's knight on d5 is under attack by the rook on e5\n- Black needs to address both the immediate threat to g7 and the knight on d5\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e7g5 - defends g7 but blocks the bishop\n2. d5f6 - moves the knight to safety while attacking the rook\n3. c8e8 - activates the rook and defends e7\n4. e7f6 - moves the queen to defend g7 and f7\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d5f6 looks tempting but after Rxf6 Qxf6, White maintains pressure\n- c8e8 is solid but doesn't address the g7 threat\n- e7f6 is the most comprehensive, defending both g7 and f7 while keeping the queen active\n\nThe best move is:\n```\ne7f6\n```"
