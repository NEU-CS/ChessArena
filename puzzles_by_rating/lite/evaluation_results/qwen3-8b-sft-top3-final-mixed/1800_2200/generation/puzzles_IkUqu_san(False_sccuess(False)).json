When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n3. Black has a strong bishop pair, but their dark-squared bishop is blocked by pawns\n4. White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n5. Black's queen on d8 is somewhat exposed\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's e5 pawn is a potential target\n- White's queen on d4 is very active\n- The knight on c3 is well placed\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocking the e-file\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d4e5 - Capturing the pawn immediately, but after ...Bxe5 White's queen is exposed\n2. g3e5 - Sacrificing the bishop to open the position, but unclear if this works\n3. c3d5 - Centralizing the knight with tempo on the bishop\n4. e1e3 - Developing the rook to support the center\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c3d5 looks very strong as it attacks the bishop on e6 and threatens to jump to e7 or f6\n- After ...Bxd5, Qxd5 gives White a strong centralized queen\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play Qxe5 with a strong position\n- This maintains White's initiative and keeps pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position as much or allow Black to consolidate. The knight move is the most forcing and keeps the initiative.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
