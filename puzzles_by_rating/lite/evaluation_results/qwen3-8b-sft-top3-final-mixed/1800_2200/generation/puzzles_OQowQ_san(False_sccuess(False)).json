When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's knight on f7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on b8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed pawn on b4 that could become dangerous\n- Black's bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Knight moves: f7h8 (discovered check), f7d8 (forking king and rook)\n- Queen moves: a6b7 (attacking rook and bishop), a6a7 (threatening mate)\n- Other threats: e3h6 (attacking g7 pawn)\n\n4. Best options:\n- f7d8 looks very strong - it forks the king and rook, forcing Black to lose material\n- a6a7 threatens mate on a8, but Black can defend with Qc7\n- f7h8+ is a discovered check, but after ...Kc7 the knight is trapped\n\nAfter considering these, f7d8 is the most forcing and winning move. It creates an immediate fork that Black cannot ignore, and after any king move, White can capture the rook on d8.\n\n```\nf7d8\n```"
