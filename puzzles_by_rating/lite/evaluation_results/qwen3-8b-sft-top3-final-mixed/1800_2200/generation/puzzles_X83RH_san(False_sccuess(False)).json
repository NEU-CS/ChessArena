When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on a8 with limited pawn cover\n- White's queen is very active on f3\n- Black has a rook on f8 that could become dangerous\n- White's knight on b3 is well placed but not immediately threatening\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3f7: Queen sacrifice to win the rook on f8, but after ...Kxf7 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- f3h5: Threatening mate on h7, but Black can defend with ...g6\n- b3c5: Knight jump attacking the bishop, but Black can just move the bishop\n- a1a4: Rook lift to potentially attack the weak a6 pawn\n- b1f1: Doubling rooks on the f-file to pressure Black's king\n\n4. Best move seems to be b1f1:\n- Doubles rooks on the f-file where Black's king is weak\n- Prepares potential rook lifts to f8\n- Maintains all other options\n- Doesn't allow Black any counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. The rook lift to f1 is the most principled move, increasing pressure on Black's position.\n\n```\nb1f1\n```"
