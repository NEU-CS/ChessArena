When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on e5\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's rook on f3 is very active\n- Black's rook on f4 is under attack by White's bishop on d4\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qd2+ next move, forcing the king to move\n- White could also play Bxf4, winning the rook\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4f8: Rook retreat to defend against Qd2+\n- f4f7: Rook moves to defend the king\n- e7f6: Knight moves to block the bishop's attack on the rook\n- g7f8: King moves to safety\n\nAfter considering these options, f4f7 seems most prudent because:\n- It defends the king by covering f7\n- It maintains the rook's activity\n- It prevents Qd2+ ideas\n- It keeps the rook defending the e5 pawn\n\nOther options have drawbacks:\n- f4f8 allows Qd2+ Kf8 Qxf8+ winning the rook\n- e7f6 allows Bxf4 Nxf4 Qd2+ winning the knight\n- g7f8 allows Qd2+ Kg8 Qxf4 winning the rook\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf4f7\n```"
