When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White's rook is very active on b4\n- Black's rook on d6 is defending the d-pawn but can be challenged\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b4b7: Rook lift to 7th rank, threatening to penetrate\n- b4b6: Attacking the pawn on f6\n- d4d5: Advancing the passed pawn\n- g3f4: King moves closer to center\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- b4b7 looks very strong as it threatens to penetrate to b6 or b5, putting pressure on Black's position\n- After b4b7, if Black plays ...Rd7, then Rb6+ wins the f6 pawn\n- If Black doesn't defend properly, White can create serious threats against the exposed king\n\nOther moves like b4b6 allow ...Rd7 defending, and d4d5 can be met with ...Rxd5.\n\nThe most forcing and dangerous move is b4b7, creating immediate threats.\n\n```\nb4b7\n```"
