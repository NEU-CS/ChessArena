When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully as Black.\n\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a strong attack with queen on h4 and rook on d3 eyeing the d-file. The knight on f6 is very active.\n2. Black's king is exposed on g7 with limited pawn cover.\n3. Black's queen on a2 is under attack by White's pawn on b2.\n4. Black has two rooks that aren't well coordinated yet.\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. a2b2 - defends the queen but allows Qxb2 with a strong attack\n2. a2a1 - retreats the queen but seems passive\n3. f8h8 - moves the rook to h-file to defend against potential Rh1 ideas\n4. e7g8 - blocks the queen's diagonal with the knight\n5. g6g5 - pushes the pawn to challenge White's strong knight on f6\n\nAfter considering these:\n- a2b2 looks dangerous after Qxb2\n- f8h8 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- e7g8 seems best as it blocks the queen's diagonal and defends the king\n- g6g5 is tempting but after Nxg5 hxg5, White's attack remains strong\n\nThe knight move e7g8 solves multiple problems:\n1. Blocks the dangerous queen diagonal\n2. Defends the king\n3. Maintains control over key squares\n4. Keeps options open for the rooks\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7g8\n```"
