When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n3. Black has a knight on h5 that's eyeing f4 and g3 squares\n4. White has a strong bishop on c4 pointing at Black's kingside\n5. Black's queen on c7 is somewhat exposed\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's king is vulnerable in the center\n- White has attacking potential against the black king\n- The bishop on c4 is very powerful and should be preserved\n- The queen on g3 is well placed but could be more active\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c4f7 - Bishop sacrifice to open the position against Black's king\n2. g3g7 - Queen sacrifice to open the g-file\n3. d1d7 - Direct attack on Black's queen\n4. c4e6 - Bishop move maintaining pressure\n\nAfter deep consideration:\n- c4f7 looks tempting but after ...Kxf7, White doesn't have enough immediate threats\n- g3g7 is interesting but after ...Kxg7, White's attack may not be decisive\n- d1d7 is strong, forcing the queen trade and opening the d-file for White's rook\n- c4e6 maintains pressure but doesn't create immediate threats\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be d1d7, attacking the queen and opening lines against Black's king. After Qxd7, Rxd7, White has a strong initiative with the bishop pair and open position.\n\n```\nd1d7\n```"
