But king is on h8, so not possible.\n- `e5d7`, `e5g6`, `e5c6`, `e5g4`, `e5c4`, `e5f3`, `e5d3`: Various knight moves. Some are aggressive, like `e5g6` attacking the queen.\n\n#### Queen on a2:\n- `a2a8`, `a2a7`, `a2a6`, `a2a5`, `a2a4`: Moving queen up the a-file.\n- `a2b3`: Capturing the knight on b3 \u2014 this is a **very strong move**.\n    - It wins material cleanly.\n    - After `a2b3`, Black gains a full piece.\n    - White cannot recapture with the pawn because it's pinned to the king by the rook on c8.\n\n#### Pawns:\n- `d6d5`: Central break, but not urgent.\n- `b6b5`: Wing pawn move, not immediately useful.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most **tactically sound and materially beneficial** move is:\n\n### `a2b3` \u2014 capturing the knight on b3.\n\nThis move:\n- Wins a piece.\n- Is not met by any immediate counterplay.\n- Keeps Black's initiative.\n- Opens the possibility of a discovered attack with the rook on c8 after the capture.\n\nAfter `a2b3`, White cannot recapture due to the pin along the c-file.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n```\na2b3\n```"

Black is in check from the white queen on g6 (Qg6+)\n2. Black's king is on h8 with only one legal move: Kh8-g8\n3. White has a strong attack with the queen and bishop coordinated against the black king\n4. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated, with the rook on c8 and knight on e5\n5. White has a passed pawn on g6 that could become dangerous\n\nThe only legal move is to move the king to g8. Let's see what happens after that:\n\nAfter Kg8:\n- White can play Qg7+ forcing Kh8 again\n- Then Qh7+ would be mate (since the knight on e5 blocks the king's escape to f8)\n\nAlternatively, after Kg8:\n- White could play Qg5+ first, forcing Kh8\n- Then Qh5+ would be mate\n\nIn both lines, Black is forced into mate in a few moves. There are no defensive resources or ways to block the checks.\n\nSince this is the only legal move and it leads to forced mate, I must play it despite the inevitable outcome.\n\n```\nh8g8\n```"

Let's check what squares are available:\n\n- g8: occupied by king\n- f8: empty\n- h8: occupied by rook\n- g7: occupied by White queen\n- f7: occupied by White queen\n- h7: occupied by White queen\n- e5: occupied by Black knight\n- d6: occupied by Black pawn\n\nSo, the only square available for the king is **f8**.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThis is a critical moment. Black must move the king to f8. There is no choice.\n\nAfter `g8f8`, White will likely continue with aggressive play, possibly with Qh7-h8+ or Qh7-g7+, but Black can respond accordingly.\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\ng8f8\n```"
