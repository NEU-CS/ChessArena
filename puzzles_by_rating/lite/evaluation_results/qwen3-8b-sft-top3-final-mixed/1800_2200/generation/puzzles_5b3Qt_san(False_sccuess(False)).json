When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on h6, eyeing the g3 square\n- White's king is exposed on g3\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play Qxg3+ winning the queen\n- Black could push d3 opening lines against the white king\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2h5: Attacks the queen but allows Qxg3+\n- e2g4: Blocks the queen's path to g3 but allows Qxg4+\n- e2f3: Protects g3 but allows Qxf3+\n- e2e3: Protects g3 and keeps queen active\n- e2h2: Moves queen away but doesn't address king safety\n- e4e5: Pushes pawn but doesn't help defense\n\n5. Best defensive move seems to be e2e3, which:\n- Protects the g3 square from queen checks\n- Keeps the queen active\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either allow immediate checks or don't address the king safety issue. While e2e3 does block the bishop's diagonal, the king is safer this way.\n\n```\ne2e3\n```"
