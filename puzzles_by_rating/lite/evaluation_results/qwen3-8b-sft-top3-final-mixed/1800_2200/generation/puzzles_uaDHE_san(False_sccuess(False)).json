When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's king is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is on e5, very active and threatening\n- Black's knight on f4 is well placed but needs to be careful about king checks\n- Black's king is on d7, somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed pawn on d6 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Kxf4, winning the knight\n- White could push the d-pawn to promote\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4e6: Blocks the d-pawn but allows Kxe6\n- f4h5: Moves knight to safety while attacking g3\n- d7c6: King moves toward center but exposes to checks\n- b7b5: Pushes pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n5. Best move seems to be f4h5:\n- Gets the knight to safety away from the king\n- Maintains pressure on g3 pawn\n- Keeps options open for the knight\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow White to make progress with the d-pawn.\n\n```\nf4h5\n```"
