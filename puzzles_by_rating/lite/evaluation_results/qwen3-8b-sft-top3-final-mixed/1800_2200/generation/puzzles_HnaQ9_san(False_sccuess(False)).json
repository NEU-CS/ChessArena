When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Pawn (f7), Pawn (d4), Pawn (h2), King\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, Pawn (g6), Pawn (d5), Pawn (c3), King\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs queen)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's f7 pawn is very dangerous and could promote soon\n- Black's queen is active but somewhat exposed\n- White's rook on f2 is controlling the f-file\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: Moves king to corner, but doesn't address threats\n- g8f8: Moves king towards center but into potential checks\n- g8h7: Moves king towards white's pawns but may be dangerous\n- g8g7: Keeps king near current position\n- g8f7: Captures the dangerous f7 pawn\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- g8f7 is the most forcing move, capturing the dangerous pawn\n- After g8f7, white can play Bf5+ but black can respond with Qxf5\n- This eliminates white's most dangerous threat and equalizes material\n- Other king moves don't address the immediate threat of the f7 pawn\n\n5. Conclusion:\nCapturing the f7 pawn is the most principled move, eliminating white's biggest threat and simplifying the position.\n\n```\ng8f7\n```"
