When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs Black's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on g7 is very active, threatening the black king\n- Black's queen on f2 is attacking White's rook on g7\n- White's bishop on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on c7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7g8: Rook sacrifice to expose the black king\n- e5f6: Bishop sacrifice to open lines against the king\n- a3d6: Queen move to attack the knight and support the rook\n- d1d3: Queen move to defend the rook\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- g7g8 looks tempting as a sacrifice: after Rxg8, Qxg8 and White can play Bf6+ winning the queen back\n- However, after g7g8 Rxg8 Qxg8, Black can play Qxg8 and White doesn't have enough compensation\n- e5f6 is interesting: after Bxf6 Qxf6, White can play Rg8+ Kd7 and the position remains complicated\n- a3d6 is solid, attacking the knight and supporting the rook, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- d1d3 is safe but passive\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most forcing and promising move is g7g8, sacrificing the rook to expose the black king. Even though it leads to some complications, White maintains strong attacking chances.\n\n```\ng7g8\n```"
