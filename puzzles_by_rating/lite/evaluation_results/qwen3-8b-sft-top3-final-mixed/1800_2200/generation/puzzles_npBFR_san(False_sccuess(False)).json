When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, knight vs White's queen, rook, pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White's king is more exposed.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is on f6, very exposed and vulnerable to checks\n- Black's queen is on e1, controlling many squares\n- Black's knight on c5 is well placed\n- White has a passed pawn on b3 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- White threatens Qxg7 winning a pawn\n- Black can deliver checks to the exposed king\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e1e5+ forces the king to move (Kf7 or Ke7), then we can follow up with checks\n- c5d7+ forks king and queen, but after Kxd7 Qxe5+ wins the queen\n- e1h4 threatens mate on h6, but White can defend with Qg7\n\nAfter considering these options, e1e5+ seems strongest because:\n- It forces the king to move\n- After Kf7, we can play Qf5+ forcing Kg8, then Qg6+ winning the queen\n- If Ke7, we have Qe5+ winning the queen\n- It maintains all our threats while forcing White's king into a worse position\n\nOther moves either don't capitalize on the exposed king or allow White to defend. The immediate check is most forcing and decisive.\n\n```\ne1e5\n```"
