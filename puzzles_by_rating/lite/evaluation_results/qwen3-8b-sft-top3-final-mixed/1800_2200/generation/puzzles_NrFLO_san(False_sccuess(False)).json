When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and the board looks like this:\n\n```\n8 | . . . . . . . .\n7 | . . . k . . b .\n6 | . . . P . . P .\n5 | . . P . . K . .\n4 | . . . . . . . .\n3 | . . . . . . . .\n2 | . . . . . . . .\n1 | . . . . . . . .\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **White has a king on f5**, pawns on c5, d6, g6.\n- **Black has a king on d7**, bishop on g7.\n- White is trying to promote one of their pawns (especially the d6 or g6 pawns).\n- Black must act quickly to stop White's pawns from promoting.\n- The Black bishop is currently on g7, which is a light-squared bishop.\n- The Black king is on d7, relatively centralized but needs to get closer to the action.\n\n### Goal for Black:\nPrevent White from promoting any pawns. Ideally, try to capture a pawn or force a draw if winning isn't possible.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n- `g7h8`, `g7f8`, `g7h6`, `g7f6`, `g7e5`, `g7d4`, `g7c3`, `g7b2`, `g7a1` \u2013 all bishop moves\n- `d7e8`, `d7d8`, `d7c8`, `d7c6` \u2013 king moves\n\nWe need to evaluate which move gives Black the best chance to stop White's pawns.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating Bishop Moves:\n\n- `g7h8`: Bishop to corner \u2013 not useful.\n- `g7f8`: Bishop to f8 \u2013 still passive.\n- `g7h6`: Bishop to h6 \u2013 attacks g6 pawn, but White can defend it.\n- `g7f6`: Bishop to f6 \u2013 controls key squares around White king and pawns.\n- `g7e5`: Bishop to e5 \u2013 active, controls center, pressures d6 and g6.\n- `g7d4`: Bishop to d4 \u2013 very active, attacks c5 and supports king.\n- `g7c3`: Bishop to c3 \u2013 less effective.\n- `g7b2`, `g7a1`: Too far from action.\n\n### Evaluating King Moves:\n\n- `d7e8`: King to e8 \u2013 too far from pawns.\n- `d7d8`: King to d8 \u2013 still not ideal.\n- `d7c8`: King to c8 \u2013 heading toward queenside pawns.\n- `d7c6`: King to c6 \u2013 very active, threatens to capture on d6 or c5.\n\n---\n\n### Best Plan:\n\nThe most urgent threat is White's **d6 pawn**, which is very close to promotion. If Black can capture it, that would be ideal.\n\nSo, moving the **king to c6** (`d7c6`) puts pressure on the d6 pawn and prepares to capture it if White doesn't defend properly.\n\nAlso, the bishop should support the king. A good follow-up after `d7c6` would be `g7d4`, attacking the c5 pawn and supporting the king.\n\nBut since we're only choosing **one move**, let's pick the most immediate and effective one.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nMove the **king to c6** to threaten the d6 pawn and start pressuring White's position.\n\n```\nd7c6\n```"
