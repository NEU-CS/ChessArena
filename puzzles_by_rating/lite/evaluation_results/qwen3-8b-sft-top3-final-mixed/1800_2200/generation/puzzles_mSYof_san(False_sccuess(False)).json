When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on e5\n- Black's king is exposed in the center\n- White's queen on c5 is very active\n- Black's queen on h6 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n- Black has a knight on c4 that's well placed\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxc4, winning the knight\n- White could also play Bxc4, but that would be less effective\n- White's e-pawn is dangerous and needs to be stopped\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h6f8: Queen retreat to defend the knight, but blocks the rook\n- h6g7: Queen moves to a safer square while maintaining pressure\n- c4d6: Knight moves to block the e-pawn, but allows Qxc4\n- e8d8: King moves to safety, but doesn't address the threats\n- h6h5: Queen moves forward, but doesn't solve any problems\n\n5. Best move seems to be h6g7:\n- Gets the queen to a safer square\n- Maintains pressure on the e5 pawn\n- Keeps options open for the rook\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White\n\nOther moves either allow Qxc4 or don't address the threats. h6g7 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\nh6g7\n```"
