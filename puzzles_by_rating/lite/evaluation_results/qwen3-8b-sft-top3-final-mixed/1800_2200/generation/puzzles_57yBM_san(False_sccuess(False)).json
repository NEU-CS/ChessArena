When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on e6 is very active, controlling the e-file and eyeing the black king.\n- Black's rook on d7 is tied to defending the d2 pawn.\n- Black's king is exposed on h5.\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could become dangerous.\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Re6-e5+ next move, forcing the black king to move.\n- White could also play Re6xd6, winning a pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d7d8: Blocks the rook's path to d6 but leaves the king exposed.\n- d7g7: Moves the rook to a more active position while defending g5.\n- c2c3: Defends the d2 pawn but blocks the rook's defense of g5.\n- h5h4: Moves the king away from potential checks but towards the edge.\n\nAfter considering these options, d7g7 seems best because:\n- It activates the rook to a more central position\n- It maintains defense of g5 pawn\n- It keeps options to defend d2 if needed\n- It prevents White from playing Re6-g6+ in some lines\n\nOther moves either leave the king too exposed or don't improve piece activity.\n\n```\nd7g7\n```"
