When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Queen, Bishop, 2 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's queen on d4 is very active and threatening\n   - White's queen on h4 is attacking the bishop on g4\n   - White's rook on g5 is very active\n   - Black's king is exposed on f8\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - g1h1: King moves to h1 (safe but passive)\n   - g1f1: King moves to f1 (also safe but still passive)\n   - h4f2: Queen takes bishop on f2 (active and aggressive)\n\n4. Evaluating h4f2:\n   - Wins the bishop for a queen (material gain)\n   - After Qxf2, Black can't recapture with the queen (Qxf2 allows Rxf2+ winning the queen)\n   - Black's best is probably Qxh4, but then Rxf5+ wins the queen back\n   - This leads to a favorable endgame for White\n\n5. Other moves are too passive and allow Black to maintain pressure. The immediate queen sacrifice is the most forcing and advantageous line.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\nh4f2\n```"
