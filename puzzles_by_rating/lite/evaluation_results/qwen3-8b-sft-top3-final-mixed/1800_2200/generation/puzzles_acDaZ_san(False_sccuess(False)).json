When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight (White has N vs Black's missing knight), but has an active queen and rook. White has a strong knight on e6 and queen on d5.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's knight on e6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's queen on d5 is eyeing the f7 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- h6f8: Queen takes knight, but after Qxf8 White has Qxf8+ winning the queen\n- g4e6: Knight takes knight, but after dxe6 White has Qxe6+ winning the queen\n- e1e6: Rook takes knight, but after dxe6 White has Qxe6+ winning the queen\n- h6g7: Queen moves to defend f7, but White can play Qxf7+ winning the queen\n- g4h5: Knight moves to attack the queen, but White can simply move the queen\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\nThe queen must defend f7 while maintaining activity. The only move that accomplishes this is h6g7, even though it loses the queen to Qxf7+ because:\n- After Qxf7+ Kxf7, Black has Rxe6 winning the knight back\n- This leads to a rook vs bishop endgame where Black is still down material but has some compensation\n\nOther moves either lose the queen or allow White to maintain too much pressure.\n\n```\nh6g7\n```"
