When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active, attacking f7 and e8\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black has a rook on e8 that's defending the back rank\n- White has a bishop on e4 that's very strong, controlling key diagonals\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5e8: Queen takes rook with check, but after ...Bxe8 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- h5f7: Queen sacrifice, but after ...Kxf7 White's compensation isn't clear\n- e4h7: Bishop sacrifice, but again unclear compensation\n- c1h6: Developing the bishop with tempo on the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5e8+:\n- Forces the rook to take (Bxe8) as other moves lose material\n- Then we can play Bxe8, winning the exchange (rook for bishop)\n- After ...Qxe8, we have Qxe8+ Rxe8, and we've won a rook for a bishop\n- The position remains complex but we have concrete material gain\n\nOther moves either don't win material or leave the position too complicated. The queen sacrifice on f7 or h7 doesn't seem to lead to anything concrete.\n\n```\nh5e8\n```"
