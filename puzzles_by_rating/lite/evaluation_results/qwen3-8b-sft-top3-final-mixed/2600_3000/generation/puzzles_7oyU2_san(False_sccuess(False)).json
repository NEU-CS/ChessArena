When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e3\n- Black has two active rooks that can coordinate\n- White's rooks are somewhat passive\n- Black's pawn structure is solid\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7c8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, threatening to double rooks on the c-file\n- d6e6: Centralizing the rook and attacking the e4 pawn\n- d5d4: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n- h7h5: Creating counterplay on the kingside\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7c8:\n- Prepares to double rooks on the c-file\n- Threatens to bring the rook to c3 with check\n- White's king has no good squares to escape\n- After c7c8, if White plays Rc3, then Rxc3 Kxc3 and Black can play Rd3+ winning the e4 pawn\n\nOther moves like d6e6 allow White to play Rc3 with counterplay. The pawn push d5d4 is too slow. Kingside pawn moves don't create immediate threats.\n\n```\nc7c8\n```"
