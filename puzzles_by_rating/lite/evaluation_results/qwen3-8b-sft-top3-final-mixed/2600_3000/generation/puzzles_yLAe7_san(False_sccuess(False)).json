When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (king + pawns). White has pawns on a3, b2, c3, g4, h4. Black has pawns on a5, b7, c6, g6, h6.\n\n2. King position: White's king is on e3, Black's king is on e5. The kings are actively placed in the center.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - White has a passed pawn on h4, but it's blocked by Black's h6 pawn.\n   - Black has a passed pawn on a5, but it's blocked by White's a3 pawn.\n   - The c-pawns are locked (c3 vs c6).\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - King moves: e3f3, e3d3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2\n   - Pawn moves: h4h5, g4g5, c3c4, a3a4, b2b3, b2b4\n\n5. Key observations:\n   - The kings are in opposition on the e-file.\n   - Advancing the h-pawn (h4h5) would create a passed pawn, but Black can simply take it with h6xh5.\n   - Advancing the g-pawn (g4g5) would also create a passed pawn, but Black can respond with ...g6xg5.\n   - The c-pawn push (c3c4) would free the a-pawn, but Black can respond with ...c6xc4.\n   - The king moves need to be careful not to allow Black to make progress.\n\n6. Best plan:\n   - The most promising move is to push the g-pawn to g5, creating a passed pawn that Black cannot immediately capture (as ...g6xg5 would allow White to recapture with h4xg5, opening the h-file for the king).\n   - After g4g5, if Black takes with ...g6xg5, then h4xg5 opens the h-file for White's king to penetrate.\n   - If Black doesn't take, White can continue to push the g-pawn or bring the king closer.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ng4g5\n```"
