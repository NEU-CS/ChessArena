When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, 2 pawns (b5, c6), King\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns (f5, h7), King\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with passed c-pawn)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on d7, controlling the 7th rank\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White's c6 pawn is passed and dangerous\n- Black's bishop on f4 is active but could be trapped\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f7g8: King moves to g8 - but then White can play Rd8+ winning the bishop\n- f7f8: King moves to f8 - still allows Rd8+ winning bishop\n- f7e8: King moves to e8 - same problem with Rd8+\n- f7g6: King moves to g6 - allows White to push c7\n- f7f6: King moves to f6 - blocks the f-pawn but allows Rd8+ winning bishop\n- f7e6: King moves to e6 - blocks c-pawn but allows Rd8+ winning bishop\n- c7d7: Rook takes rook - this seems forced as other moves lose material\n\n4. Best move:\nAfter analyzing all options, c7d7 is forced as it's the only way to avoid immediate material loss. While it gives up the exchange (rook for rook), it eliminates White's active rook and gives Black's king more safety.\n\n```\nc7d7\n```"
