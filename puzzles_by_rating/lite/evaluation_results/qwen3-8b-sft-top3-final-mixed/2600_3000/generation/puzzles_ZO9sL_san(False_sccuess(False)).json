When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on d7 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g5\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on b6\n- White's knight on e3 is well placed\n- Black's rook on d3 is pinning White's rook to the king\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens ...Rd3xd7 winning the rook\n- Black also has ...Bf6 ideas to attack the knight\n- White needs to maintain the rook's activity while defending against threats\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d7d8: Rook retreat, but allows ...Rd3xd8\n- d7h7: Attacks the h-pawn, but Black can play ...Rd3xd7\n- e3f5: Knight moves to attack the king, but Black can play ...Rd3xd7\n- a6a7: Pushes the passed pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h1h2: King moves to safety, but doesn't solve the rook issue\n\n5. Best move seems to be d7g7:\n- Attacks the g5 king\n- If Black takes ...Rd3xd7, then Kxg7 and White's king is safer\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains rook activity\n- Creates threats against the king while defending the rook\n\nAfter considering all options, d7g7 seems the most forcing and active move that maintains White's initiative.\n\n```\nd7g7\n```"
