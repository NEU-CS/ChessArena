When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's pawn on g7 is very advanced and threatens to promote\n- Black's pawn on h3 is also dangerous but further away\n- Both kings are active\n- Black's bishop controls the promotion square g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g6e8: Bishop takes bishop, but after Kxe8, Black's king can stop the pawn\n- g6h7: Bishop moves to h7, but doesn't make progress\n- g6f7: Bishop moves to f7, but doesn't help the pawn\n- f6g5: King moves toward the pawn, but allows Black counterplay\n- f6f5: King moves forward, but doesn't help the pawn\n\n4. Best move appears to be g6e8:\n- It forces the bishop exchange\n- After Kxe8, White can play Kf7 stopping the black king from reaching g8\n- Then White can push the pawn with g7-g8=Q\n- Black's h-pawn is too slow to stop this\n\nOther moves either don't make progress or allow Black counterplay. The bishop exchange is forced to promote the pawn.\n\n```\ng6e8\n```"
