When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on a5 is very active, eyeing the b8 square where Black's king is.\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover.\n- Black's knight on e5 is well-placed but could be challenged.\n- White's rook on b6 is very active, pinning the pawn on b7 to the king.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6b8: Rook sacrifice to expose the king\n- a5a8: Queen sacrifice to expose the king\n- b1h7: Bishop sacrifice to open the king\n- Other rook moves maintaining pressure\n\n4. Calculating b6b8:\n- b6b8+ Qxb8 (forced)\n- a5a8+ Qxa8 (forced)\n- Now b1h7! is a discovered check with the bishop\n- Black must play Kh8 (only move)\n- Then h3h4+ Kg8\n- h4h5+ Kf7\n- h5h6 Ke7\n- h6h7 Kd6\n- h7h8=Q+ Kc7\n- White gets a queen for rook and knight, which is winning\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous line. The sacrifices all lead to winning material or checkmate.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\nb6b8\n```"
