When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on c7\n- White's queen and knight are very active\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on g3\n- White's rook on a1 is undeveloped\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is ...Rh1 winning the queen\n- White needs to address this while maintaining initiative\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g5h7: Knight sacrifice to expose black king\n- g4h5: Queen move threatening mate on h7\n- g4f5: Queen centralization\n- a1f1: Rook move to defend against Rh1\n\nAfter considering:\n- g5h7 looks tempting but after ...Kxh7, White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- g4h5 threatens Qxh7# but Black can defend with ...Rh1\n- a1f1 is solid but passive\n- g4f5 is strong, centralizing the queen while maintaining threats\n\nThe best move is g4f5, which:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Maintains pressure on h7\n- Keeps options to defend against Rh1\n- Prepares potential discovered attacks with the knight\n\n```\ng4f5\n```"
