When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has knight, bishop, pawns vs Black's queen, bishop, knight, pawns). However, White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a knight on h7 that's very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's king is exposed on d8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a strong knight on e4 controlling key squares\n- Black's queen on c7 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7f8: Knight sacrifice to open Black's king\n- e4f6: Knight fork attacking queen and bishop\n- d3a6: Bishop sacrifice to open Black's king\n- c2a4: Queen move to attack weak pawns\n\n4. Deep analysis:\n- h7f8 looks tempting as it forces gxf8, then Qxf8+ Kd7 Qxc7 winning the queen. But after ...Kd7, White can play Qxc7+ Kxc7, and while White is up material, Black's pieces remain active.\n- e4f6 is strong as it forks queen and bishop. After Qxf6 Bxf6, White wins the bishop pair and maintains pressure.\n- d3a6 is interesting but after ...bxa6, White doesn't get enough compensation for the sacrificed bishop.\n\nThe most forcing and advantageous move appears to be e4f6, winning material while maintaining initiative. After Qxf6 Bxf6, White has a strong bishop pair and Black's king remains exposed.\n\n```\ne4f6\n```"
