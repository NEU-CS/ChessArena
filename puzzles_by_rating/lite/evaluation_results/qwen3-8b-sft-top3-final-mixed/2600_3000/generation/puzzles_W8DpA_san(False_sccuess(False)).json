When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop + pawns vs Black's bishop + pawns. Material is equal, but White has a passed pawn on d5.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f1, while Black's king is more active on d4.\n\n3. Key features:\n   - Black's bishop on f2 is very active, controlling important squares\n   - White's bishop on c2 is somewhat restricted\n   - Black has a passed pawn on b4\n   - White's g4 pawn is under attack by Black's h5 pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - c2h7: Bishop sacrifice to remove Black's active bishop\n   - c2g6: Bishop move attacking h5 pawn\n   - f1g2: King move to safety while attacking bishop\n   - g4g5: Pushing passed pawn but leaves h2 pawn undefended\n\n5. Best options:\n   - c2h7 looks tempting as it removes Black's active bishop, but after ...Kxh7 White's king remains exposed\n   - f1g2 is solid, attacking the bishop while getting the king to safety\n   - c2g6 is interesting, attacking h5 while keeping bishop active\n\nAfter considering these, f1g2 seems most prudent:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Attacks the bishop\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nThe other moves either leave the king exposed or don't address the immediate threats.\n\n```\nf1g2\n```"
