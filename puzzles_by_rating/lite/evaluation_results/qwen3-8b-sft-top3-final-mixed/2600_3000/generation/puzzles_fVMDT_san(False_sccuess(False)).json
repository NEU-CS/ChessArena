When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on c4\n- Black has a strong bishop on h5 pinning the h4 pawn to the king\n- Black's rook on f7 is very active\n- White's rook on a6 is threatening the a7 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5g4: Bishop takes pawn, but after Kxg4 we lose the pin\n- f7f8: Rook to 8th rank, but doesn't accomplish much\n- g3g5: Pushing the pawn to create threats\n- h5f3: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- f7f5: Rook moves forward, but allows White counterplay\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5g4:\n- Wins a pawn immediately\n- After Kxg4, we can play f7f5+ forking king and rook\n- If White doesn't take, we maintain the pin\n- Even if White plays Kd3 after h5g4, we have good compensation\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to consolidate. The pawn capture is the most forcing and concrete gain.\n\n```\nh5g4\n```"
