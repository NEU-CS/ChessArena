When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a pawn (roughly -7 points), but has some active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a very strong queen on h7 attacking the rook on f5 and threatening mate on g7\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on f5 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on g6\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White threatens Qxg7# if Black doesn't defend\n- White also has ideas like Rf1-f8+ or Rf1-f7 with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8e8 - moves king away from danger but into potential checks\n- e7e8 - blocks the queen's path to g7 but leaves king exposed\n- f5f7 - sacrifices the rook to eliminate the dangerous bishop\n- f5f6 - moves rook but still leaves king in danger\n- e7g5 - blocks with queen but allows Qxg5\n\nAfter careful consideration, f5f7 seems like the best practical chance:\n- It sacrifices the rook to eliminate the dangerous bishop on g6\n- After Rxf7, White can play Qxh8 winning the rook, but Black gets some counterplay\n- Other moves either allow immediate mate or leave the king too exposed\n\nThe alternatives either allow mate or don't address the immediate threats. While the sacrifice is painful, it's the most forcing way to continue the game.\n\n```\nf5f7\n```"
