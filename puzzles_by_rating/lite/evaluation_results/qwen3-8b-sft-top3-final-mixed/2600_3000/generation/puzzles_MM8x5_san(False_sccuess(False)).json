When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on e3, attacking g1 and eyeing the h3 pawn\n- White's queen on a5 is very powerful, controlling many squares\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens Qxg1# if not prevented\n- Black also has passed pawns on c2 and e4 that could become dangerous\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: a5d8 looks tempting to check the king\n- Bishop moves: c4g8+ is a discovered check\n- King moves: h1h2 to get out of potential mate threats\n\nAfter considering:\n- a5d8+ Kf7 (forced) Qf8+ Ke7 Qe8+ Kd7 Qd8+ - this leads to a queen trade but leaves White with a winning bishop vs pawns endgame\n- c4g8+ fxg8=Q Qxg8+ Ke7 - this loses the bishop for a pawn\n- h1h2 is safe but doesn't address the immediate threats\n\nThe most forcing and best move appears to be a5d8+, which leads to a queen trade while maintaining a winning endgame. After the sequence, White will have bishop vs pawns which should be winning with correct play.\n\n```\na5d8\n```"
