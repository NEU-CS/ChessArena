When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen, rook, knight. Material is equal, but White has a passed pawn on c6 that's very dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's c6 pawn is one step from promotion and supported by the queen\n- Black's queen is very active on f5, eyeing the g3 pawn and potentially threatening mate\n- Black's rook on d7 is defending the d5 pawn\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6c7: Pushing the pawn to c7 looks very strong, threatening to promote next move\n- c6d7: Capturing the rook, but after Qxd7 White's pawn is gone and Black's queen becomes very active\n- c6h6: Moving the pawn to h6 to avoid potential checks, but this seems passive\n- b1c3: Developing the knight, but doesn't address the immediate opportunity\n\n4. After c6c7:\n- If Black takes with Rxc7, Qxc7 wins the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, c7-c8=Q is unstoppable\n- Black's best reply might be Qxg3, but then c7-c8=Q is still winning\n\n5. Other moves like developing pieces don't take advantage of the immediate winning opportunity.\n\nThe most forcing and decisive move is to push the pawn to c7, creating an unstoppable promotion threat. Black has no good way to stop both the pawn promotion and the resulting material gain.\n\n```\nc6c7\n```"
