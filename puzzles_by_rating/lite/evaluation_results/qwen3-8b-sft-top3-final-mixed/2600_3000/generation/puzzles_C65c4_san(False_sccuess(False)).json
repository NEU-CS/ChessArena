When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop pair and active pieces\n- Black's queen is very active on f2, attacking g2 and e2\n- White's queen on h3 is eyeing the h-file\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on e6\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxh7+ winning the rook\n- White could also play Bxf6 winning a pawn\n- Black needs to address these threats while maintaining counterplay\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7h8: Blocks the h-file but leaves the king very passive\n- f2g2: Defends against Qxh7+ but allows Bxf6\n- f2f5: Attacks the e6 pawn but allows Qxh7+\n- f2h4: Pins the h3 queen to the king, but White can play Qxh7+ anyway\n- f8f7: Covers h7 but blocks the rook\n\nAfter considering these, the best move appears to be f2g2, which:\n- Defends against Qxh7+ by covering g2\n- Maintains the queen's active position\n- If White takes on f6, Black can recapture with the bishop\n- Keeps options to bring the rook into play via f8\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nf2g2\n```"
