When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on a5 is very active and threatening Black's pawn on b5\n- Black's knight on d6 is somewhat restricted by White's pawn on h5\n- Black's pawn on f3 is passed but blockaded by White's king\n- White's pawn on h5 is passed but blockaded by Black's knight\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e8: Moves knight to e8, but this seems passive\n- d6f7: Attacks h6 square, but doesn't solve immediate problems\n- b6c7: King moves towards center, but exposes to checks\n- f6f5: Pushes passed pawn, but White can respond with gxf5\n- a4a3: Pushes pawn, but White can take with bxa3\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6f5:\n- Attacks White's g2 pawn\n- If White takes knight (gxf5), Black can play f3f2, creating a passed pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can consider pushing f6-f5 next move\n- Also prevents White from playing h5-h6 which would be dangerous\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or are too passive. d6f5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nd6f5\n```"
