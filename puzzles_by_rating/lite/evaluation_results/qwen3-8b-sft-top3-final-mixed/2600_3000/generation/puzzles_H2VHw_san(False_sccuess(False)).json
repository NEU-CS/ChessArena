When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: King on e6, Knight on e5, Pawn on f7, Pawn on h3\n- **Black**: King on h7, Bishop on b4, Pawn on g6, Pawn on h5\n\n### Goals for Black:\n- Avoid losing\n- Try to win if possible\n- If not, secure a draw\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White has a dangerous passed pawn on **f7**, one move away from queening.\n- Black\u2019s king is far from the action (on h7), but can potentially interfere with the f7 pawn.\n- Black\u2019s bishop is active and can control key squares.\n- Black has two pawns on the kingside (g6 and h5), which could be used to create counterplay or distract White.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `h7h8`: Move king to h8 \u2013 passive, doesn't help stop f7-f8=Q.\n- `h7g7`: Move king toward center \u2013 better, but still too slow.\n- `h7h6`: Move king forward slightly \u2013 not helpful.\n\n#### Bishop moves:\n- `b4f8`: Bishop to f8 \u2013 controls the queening square of the f7 pawn! This is very strong.\n- `b4e7`: Bishop to e7 \u2013 also controls f8, but less active than f8.\n- Other bishop moves (`b4d6`, `b4c5`, etc.) don't seem as relevant.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- `g6g5`: Advances pawn, creates space, but not urgent.\n- `h5h4`: Same idea, but less effective here.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most critical threat is **f7-f8=Q**. If White promotes, they will have a queen and likely win.\n\nSo, we must **stop that promotion**.\n\nThe best way to do that is to **control the queening square f8**.\n\nThat square is currently **uncovered** and can be controlled by the bishop.\n\nThus, the best move is:\n\n```\nb4f8\n```\n\nThis puts the bishop on f8, directly controlling the queening square of the f7 pawn. It also keeps the bishop active and ready to support other plans.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```\nb4f8\n```"
