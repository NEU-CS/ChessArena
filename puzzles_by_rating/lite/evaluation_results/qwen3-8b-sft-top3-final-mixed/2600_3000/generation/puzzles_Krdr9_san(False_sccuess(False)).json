When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, rook and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on d5 is very active, attacking the rook on d8\n- Black's king is exposed on f8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black has a passed c-pawn that's currently blockaded by White's knight\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5g8: Bishop takes rook with check, but after ...Kxg8 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- d5f7: Bishop checks the king, but Black can play ...Kxf7 and White doesn't gain much\n- e2e8: Rook takes rook, but after ...Bxe8 White's attack fizzles out\n- b3c5: Knight moves to attack the c-pawn, but allows Black counterplay\n- g3g4: Pushing the pawn to create threats against Black's king\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5g8:\n- It wins the exchange (bishop for rook)\n- After ...Kxg8, White can play Rxe8+ Kf7 and then push the h-pawn\n- Black's king remains exposed and White maintains pressure\n- Other moves either don't win material or allow Black to consolidate\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nd5g8\n```"
