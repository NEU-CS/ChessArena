When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

However, Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a strong bishop on e3 pinning White's knight on c3 to the king\n- Black's queen on b6 is eyeing the b2 pawn\n- White's queen on g5 is very active but potentially trapped\n- White's bishop on h8 is awkwardly placed but could be useful\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Qxb2 winning a pawn\n- Black could play ...Bxc1 winning the exchange\n- White's queen could be trapped if not careful\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5g8: Queen retreat to safety while maintaining pressure\n- h8g7: Bishop moves to a more active diagonal\n- c3e4: Knight moves to break the pin\n- a1e1: Rook moves to defend the e-file\n\nAfter considering these options, the most pressing issue is the safety of the queen. g5g8 seems best because:\n- It saves the queen from potential traps\n- It maintains pressure on Black's position\n- It keeps the initiative\n- It doesn't allow Black to win material immediately\n\nOther moves either leave the queen vulnerable or don't address the immediate threats as effectively.\n\n```\ng5g8\n```"
