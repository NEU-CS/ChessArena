When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key threats:\n- White's queen is attacking the d7 knight and could potentially fork king and rook with Qd6+\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6h4: Queen move attacking the rook on f1, but after Qxh4 White can play Qxd6 winning material\n- f6g5: Centralizing the queen while defending d7, but allows Qxd6\n- f6e5: Blocking the queen's attack on d7 while maintaining control of key squares\n- f8h8: Moving the rook to safety while keeping pressure on the h-file\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to protect the d7 knight while maintaining counterplay\n- f6e5 seems most flexible, defending d7 and keeping options open\n- After f6e5, if Qxd6 then exd6 and Black is fine\n- Also prevents any potential Qd6+ ideas\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the position too passive. The rook moves don't address the immediate threats.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6e5\n```"
