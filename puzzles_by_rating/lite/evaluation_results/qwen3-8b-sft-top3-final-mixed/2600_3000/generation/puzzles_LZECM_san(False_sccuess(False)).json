When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on e7, while White's king is relatively safer on e4.\n\n3. Key features:\n   - White has a passed pawn on f5 that could become dangerous\n   - Black's rook on a5 is active but could be vulnerable\n   - Black's pawn structure is slightly compromised with isolated pawns\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - King moves: e7f8 or e7d8 to get the king to safety\n   - Rook moves: a5a8 to trade rooks (but this would be bad as White's king is safer)\n   - Pawn moves: g7g6 to challenge White's g4 pawn or h6h5 to create counterplay\n\n5. Best options:\n   - e7f8 gets the king to relative safety while keeping options open\n   - a5a4 could be interesting to attack the b5 pawn, but White can defend\n   - g7g6 is tempting to challenge White's pawn structure\n\nAfter considering these factors, the most prudent move is to get the king to safety first. e7f8 accomplishes this while keeping all other options open.\n\n```\ne7f8\n```"
