When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong centralized knight on c6 and bishop on e6\n3. White's bishop on f4 is very active but potentially trapped\n4. Black's queen on c8 is eyeing the c2 bishop\n5. White's king is somewhat exposed on c1\n\nKey observations:\n- The bishop on f4 is under attack from the queen on c8\n- If we don't move it, Black can play Qxf4 next move\n- We need to find a safe square for the bishop while maintaining activity\n\nCandidate moves for the bishop:\n1. f4b8 - trades bishop for rook, but gives up material\n2. f4c7 - blocks the queen's attack but allows ...Qxc7\n3. f4h6 - looks tempting but after ...gxh6, our bishop is gone\n4. f4d6 - pins the knight to the king, looks very strong\n5. f4g5 - keeps the bishop active but still under attack\n\nAfter considering these:\n- f4d6 seems best as it pins the knight and maintains the bishop\n- After f4d6, if Black takes with ...exd6, we recapture with exd6 and open the e-file\n- The pin is very uncomfortable for Black as the knight can't move without losing material\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve our position as much. The pin on the knight is a strong positional advantage.\n\n```\nf4d6\n```"
