When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has a more active position.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on h2, threatening mate on g2\n- White's king is exposed on f2\n- Black has a rook on h6 eyeing the h-file\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen can deliver mate with Qxg2#\n- Black's rook can swing to h2 with Rh2+ followed by Qxg2#\n\n4. Candidate moves to prevent mate:\n- g3g4 blocks the queen's path to g2\n- e2g4 also blocks the queen's path\n- f2f1 moves the king away from danger\n- c1h1 blocks the rook's path to h2\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- g3g4 seems most forcing as it directly blocks the queen's path to g2 while maintaining material equality\n- e2g4 is also good but allows Qxg4+ winning a pawn\n- f2f1 is safe but passive\n- c1h1 is interesting but allows Rh2+ next move\n\nThe most precise move is g3g4, preventing mate while maintaining all options. Other moves either allow mate or give up material.\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
