When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (queen vs queen + rook is bad, but White has more pawns).\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on d7\n- White's queen is centralized on c4\n- Black has a passed a-pawn that's advanced to a3\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n- Black's king is on g8\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play Qd1+ next move, forcing White's king to move\n- Black's a-pawn is dangerous and could promote if not stopped\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c4c8: Queen sacrifice to eliminate Black's rook, but after Qxc8 White's position remains difficult\n- c4d5: Blocking the a-pawn's path to promotion while attacking the e6 pawn\n- c4c7: Attacking the queen and defending against Qd1+\n- g1h1: Moving the king away from potential checks\n\nAfter considering these options, c4d5 seems most promising because:\n- It stops the a-pawn from promoting (now blocked by our queen)\n- It attacks the e6 pawn which is only defended by the f6 pawn\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It doesn't allow any immediate counterplay from Black\n\nOther moves either don't address the a-pawn threat or allow Black to maintain too much initiative.\n\n```\nc4d5\n```"
