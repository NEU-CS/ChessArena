When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have all pieces except Black is missing a knight)\n2. White has a strong pawn center with pawns on e5 and f5\n3. Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous\n4. White has pressure on the kingside with pieces aimed at g7\n5. Black's queen on c6 is active but could be vulnerable\n6. Black's knight on g5 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on c4\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the pin on the g5 knight\n- Should consider king safety\n- Need to deal with White's strong pawn center\n- Need to activate Black's pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g8f6 - Develops knight and breaks the pin, but allows Bxf6\n2. g5e6 - Moves knight out of pin, but blocks the e6 square\n3. e8d8 - Gets king out of center but looks passive\n4. c8e6 - Develops bishop and defends e5 pawn\n5. g5h7 - Moves knight away but leaves g7 weak\n\nAfter considering these, c8e6 seems most principled:\n- Develops a piece\n- Defends the e5 pawn\n- Prepares to castle queenside\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either leave the pin or create new problems. The king is safe enough for now as White doesn't have immediate threats.\n\n```\nc8e6\n```"
