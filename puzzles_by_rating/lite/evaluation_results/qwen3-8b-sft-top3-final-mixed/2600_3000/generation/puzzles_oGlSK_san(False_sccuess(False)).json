When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (king + pawns). White has pawns on c5, d5, d4, g2, h2. Black has pawns on a6, f3, g6, h7.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is more active (d4) vs Black's king (e7)\n- White has a passed pawn on d5 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on f3 that's very advanced\n- Black's h-pawn is also advanced (h7)\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's f3 pawn is threatening to promote soon (f3-f2-f1=Q)\n- White needs to deal with this while making progress with own pawns\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d4e5: King moves toward Black's pawns but doesn't address f3 threat\n- d4e4: Similar to e5, not addressing f3\n- d4c4: Moves king away from action\n- d4c3: Gets closer to f3 but may be too slow\n- d5d6: Advances passed pawn but doesn't stop f3\n- c5c6: Advances pawn but doesn't help with f3\n- h2h3/h4: Doesn't address main issues\n- g2g3/g4: g4 looks interesting to block f3\n\n5. Best move seems g2g4:\n- Blocks the f3 pawn's advance (now f3 can't go to f2)\n- Creates a passed pawn on g4 which can be pushed later\n- Maintains king's central position\n- If Black takes g4 with f3, then d5-d6 creates a dangerous passed pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the f3 threat or are too slow. g4 is the most active move that solves the immediate problem while maintaining White's positional advantages.\n\n```\ng2g4\n```"
