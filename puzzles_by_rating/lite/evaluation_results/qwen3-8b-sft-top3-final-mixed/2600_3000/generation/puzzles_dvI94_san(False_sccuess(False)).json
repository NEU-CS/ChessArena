When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook, queen, pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on h6 is very strong, eyeing the f8 square and controlling important diagonals\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has a passed pawn on b5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's queen on e6 is active but potentially vulnerable\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxc8+ winning the rook\n- White could play Qf7+ winning the king\n- White could play Bxf8 winning the rook\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c8h8: Rook moves to h8, defending against Qxc8+ but allowing Bxf8\n- e6f6: Queen moves to f6, blocking the bishop's diagonal and defending f7\n- f7f8: King moves to f8, getting out of potential checks but into a more passive position\n- e6d7: Queen moves to d7, defending the rook and keeping options open\n\nAfter considering these options, e6f6 seems most promising because:\n- It blocks the bishop's diagonal\n- It defends the f7 square against Qf7+\n- It maintains the queen's activity\n- It doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White\n\nOther moves either lose material or lead to worse positions. For example, c8h8 allows Bxf8, and f7f8 leads to a passive king position.\n\n```\ne6f6\n```"
