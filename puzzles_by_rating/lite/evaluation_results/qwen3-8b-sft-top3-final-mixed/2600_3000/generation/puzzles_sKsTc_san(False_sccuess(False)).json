When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (king + pawns). White has pawns on a4, b3, c2, e5, g3, h3. Black has pawns on a6, b6, c5, d4, f5, g5.\n\n2. King positions: White king is on e4, Black king on e6. Both kings are active in the center.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - White has a passed pawn on e5, but it's blockaded by Black's f5 pawn.\n   - Black has a passed pawn on d4, which is very dangerous as it's close to promotion.\n   - White's pawns on the queenside are more advanced but less dangerous.\n\n4. Immediate threats:\n   - Black's d4 pawn is one step from promotion. If it promotes, Black wins easily.\n   - White's e5 pawn is protected by the king and can't advance immediately.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n   - e6e7: King moves forward, but doesn't address the d4 pawn.\n   - e6d7: King moves toward the d4 pawn, but allows White counterplay.\n   - f7f6: Doesn't help with the main issues.\n   - b6b5: Doesn't address the critical d4 pawn.\n   - a6a5: Same as above.\n   - c5c4: This would block the d4 pawn's path to promotion.\n   - d4d3: Pushes the passed pawn, but White can capture with Kxd3.\n   - f7f5: Doesn't help with the main issues.\n\nThe best move is clearly to push the passed pawn with d4d3. Even though White can capture it with Kxd3, this opens the d-file for Black's king to attack White's pawns. After Kxd3, Black can play Kd5, attacking White's pawns and gaining a decisive advantage.\n\n```\nd4d3\n```"
