When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: King, Knight (b7), Bishop (a6), pawns (b4, c4, d5)\n   - Black has: King (c6), Bishop (f6), Knight (e4), pawns (d5, g5)\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on d5\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's king is somewhat exposed on c6\n   - White's king is on e3, which is a bit exposed but active\n   - Black has a knight on e4 that's very active\n   - White's bishop on a6 is blocked by its own pawn on b4\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - e3f3: King moves towards the center but exposes it to checks from Black's bishop\n   - e3d3: King moves towards the queenside, potentially supporting the b4 pawn\n   - e3e2: King retreats, but seems passive\n\n4. Evaluating each move:\n   - e3f3: After Kf3, Black can play Bg4+ forcing Ke3, then maybe Nf2+ winning the bishop\n   - e3e2: Too passive, allows Black to activate their pieces\n   - e3d3: Best option - gets the king closer to the queenside pawns, supports b4, and keeps options open\n\n5. The move e3d3 also prevents Black from playing ...Nc3+ which would be dangerous. It maintains flexibility for White's pieces while reducing king exposure.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3d3\n```"
