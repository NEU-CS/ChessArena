When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. White has a strong centralized position with pieces active (Bf4, Nd3, Nf3)\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced in front\n4. White's pawn on e5 is cramping Black's position\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated - the bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on d7\n\nKey observations:\n- White's queen on d1 is eyeing the d8 square\n- Black's queen on d8 is awkwardly placed and could be vulnerable\n- The knight on c4 is well-placed but could be challenged\n- Black needs to improve piece coordination and king safety\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d8c7 - Queen moves to a safer square while connecting rooks\n2. e6f5 - Bishop moves to challenge White's strong e5 pawn\n3. c4d6 - Knight moves to a more central square\n4. d7f6 - Bishop moves to develop and connect pieces\n\nAfter considering these:\n- d8c7 looks solid but doesn't address the e5 pawn issue\n- e6f5 is interesting but after exf6, Black's pawn structure is weakened\n- c4d6 is good but White can play Bxd6\n- d7f6 seems best, developing the bishop and preparing to challenge e5 with ...f6\n\nThe move d7f6:\n- Develops the bishop to a more active square\n- Prepares to challenge White's strong e5 pawn with ...f6\n- Connects the rooks\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd7f6\n```"
