When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on g6 is very active, eyeing the black king on h8\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- Black's queen on d7 is defending the rook on e8\n- White's bishop on h6 is pinning the black rook to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6f8: Bishop takes rook with check, but after ...Qxf8 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- g6g8: Queen takes rook with check, but after ...Qxg8 White loses the queen for rook\n- g6h7: Queen moves to h7, threatening mate on h8, but Black can defend with ...Qg7\n- g6f7: Queen moves to f7, attacking the bishop and threatening mate on h8\n- d2e4: Knight moves to e4, attacking the bishop on d4\n\n4. Best move appears to be g6f7:\n- Attacks the bishop on d4\n- Threatens mate on h8 (Qh7#)\n- If Black plays ...Qg7 to defend, then Qxg7+ Kxg7 and White has Bxf8 winning the rook\n- If Black moves the bishop, then Qh7# is mate\n\nAfter considering all options, g6f7 seems the most forcing and dangerous move, creating multiple threats that Black cannot adequately defend against.\n\n```\ng6f7\n```"
