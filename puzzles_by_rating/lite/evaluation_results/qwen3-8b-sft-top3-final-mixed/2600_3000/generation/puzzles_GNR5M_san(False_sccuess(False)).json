When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: King on h2, pawn on g6, pawn on h7, rook on a1\n- **Black**: King on e4, pawn on e6, pawn on a3, rook on a8\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White has a dangerous passed pawn on **g6**, supported by the h7 pawn.\n- Black\u2019s king is active in the center (e4), which is good.\n- Black has a rook on a8, currently passive.\n- Black has a pawn on a3, which could potentially promote if supported.\n- The white king is on h2, far from the action but can support the g/h pawns.\n- Black must act quickly to prevent White from promoting the g6 pawn.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### Rook moves:\n- `a8h8`: Brings rook to h-file, possibly to stop g6-g7 or h7-h8=Q.\n- `a8g8`: Same idea, more central.\n- `a8f8`, `a8e8`, etc.: Less useful; not stopping the g-pawn.\n- `a8a7`, `a8a6`, etc.: Moving rook down the a-file doesn't help much unless supporting a3-a2.\n\n#### King moves:\n- `e4f5`, `e4e5`, `e4d5`: Centralizing or advancing king.\n- `e4f4`, `e4d4`, `e4f3`, `e4e3`, `e4d3`: Also king maneuvering.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- `e6e5`: Opens up space for king or rook.\n- `a3a2`: Pushes the pawn closer to promotion.\n\n---\n\n### Plan for Black:\nThe most urgent threat is **g6-g7**, followed by **h7-h8=Q**. Black must either:\n1. Stop the g6 pawn from advancing, or\n2. Create counterplay with the a3 pawn.\n\nThe best way to stop the g6 pawn is to bring the rook to the h-file or g-file.\n\nBetween `a8h8` and `a8g8`, both are strong. `a8h8` is slightly better because:\n- It directly targets the h-file where the h7 pawn will promote.\n- It also covers g8, so if White tries to push g6-g7, Black can respond with ...Rh8xg8.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n\n```\na8h8\n```"
