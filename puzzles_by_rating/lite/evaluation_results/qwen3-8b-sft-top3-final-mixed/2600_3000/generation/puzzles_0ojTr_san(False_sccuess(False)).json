When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (king + pawns). White has pawns on b5, c5, g4, h3. Black has pawns on a7, b7, g5, h6.\n\n2. King positions: White king is on d4, Black king on e6. Both kings are active in the center.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - White has connected passed pawns on the queenside (b5, c5)\n   - Black has isolated pawns on the kingside (g5, h6)\n   - The h-pawn is under attack from White's g4 pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e6f7: King moves towards White's queenside pawns\n   - e6e7: King stays central but doesn't accomplish much\n   - e6d7: King moves towards queenside pawns\n   - e6f6: King moves towards kingside pawns\n   - b7b6: Challenges White's c5 pawn\n   - a7a6: Challenges White's b5 pawn\n   - h6h5: Pushes the h-pawn but leaves it more vulnerable\n   - a7a5: Creates a passed pawn but may be premature\n\n5. Best plan:\n   - Black needs to stop White's queenside pawns while advancing own kingside pawns\n   - The most active move is e6d7, bringing the king towards the queenside pawns\n   - This also keeps options open to support the kingside pawns later\n\n6. Other moves:\n   - b7b6 allows cxb6 and White gets a passed pawn\n   - a7a6 allows bxa6 and White gets a passed pawn\n   - h6h5 weakens the pawn structure\n   - King moves towards kingside (f6) don't address the queenside threat\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6d7\n```"
