When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight on g5 and e4, queen on c3, pawns on a4, b4, g3, h2. Black has queen on g4, bishop on g7, knight on d5, pawns on a7, c6, d6, h5. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e2 with black's queen and bishop eyeing it. Black's king is still in the center but has castling rights.\n\n3. Immediate threats: Black's queen on g4 is attacking g3 pawn and eyeing the king. The knight on d5 is also a strong piece.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e2d3: Gets the king away from immediate threats but still exposed\n- e2f2: Puts king on f2, still vulnerable to queen checks\n- e2d2: Similar to d3 but less active\n- e2f1: Retreats king but very passive\n- e2e1: Also passive\n- g5f3: Interesting - trades knight for queen, but after Qxf3 White's position remains dangerous\n\n5. Best option seems g5f3:\n- Forces queen trade: Qxf3 gxf3\n- Removes black's active queen\n- Opens g-file for white's rook\n- After Qxf3 gxf3, white can play Rhf1 pinning the f7 pawn\n- Black's bishop on g7 is still strong but less dangerous\n\nOther moves leave the king too exposed to checks and threats. While g5f3 gives up the knight, it's necessary to defuse the immediate danger.\n\n```\ng5f3\n```"
