When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen on e5 is very active and threatening\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black has a rook on g7 eyeing the g-file\n- White's rook on c1 is undefended\n- Black's pawn on b7 is weak but could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play Qe1+ winning the rook on c1\n- Black could play Rg1+ winning the queen\n- Black could push the b-pawn to promote\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f2a7: Queen takes pawn, but allows Qe1+ winning the rook\n- f2b6: Queen moves to b6, defending the rook but allowing Qe1+\n- e1e3: King moves away from potential checks\n- c1d1: Rook moves to defend against Qe1+\n- f2h4: Queen moves to h4, attacking the rook on g7\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be f2h4, attacking the rook on g7. This:\n- Defends against Qe1+ by threatening material\n- Gains a tempo by attacking the rook\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any immediate counterplay from Black\n\nOther moves either allow immediate material loss or don't address the threats as effectively.\n\n```\nf2h4\n```"
