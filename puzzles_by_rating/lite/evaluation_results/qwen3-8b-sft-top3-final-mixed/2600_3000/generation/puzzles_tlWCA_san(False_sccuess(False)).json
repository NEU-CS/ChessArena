When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong bishop pair and active pieces, especially the queen on f5 and bishop on h3\n3. White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n4. Black has potential threats like ...Qxf2+ or ...Bxg2\n5. White needs to address the immediate threats while improving his position\n\nKey observations:\n- The bishop on h3 is very dangerous, eyeing g2 and f2\n- The knight on f3 is pinned to the king by the bishop on h3\n- The queen on f5 is very active and threatening\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f3g5 - unpins the knight but allows ...Qxg5\n2. f3e5 - blocks the queen's diagonal but allows ...Bxg2\n3. c1h6 - develops the bishop and attacks the queen\n4. e1e4 - centralizes the rook and defends f4\n5. g3g4 - pushes the pawn to challenge the bishop\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- c1h6 looks tempting as it attacks the queen, but after ...Qxh6, White's position remains difficult\n- e1e4 is solid, defending f4 and preparing to double rooks\n- g3g4 is interesting to challenge the bishop, but after ...Bxg4, White's king remains exposed\n\nThe best move appears to be e1e4, which:\n- Defends the f4 square\n- Centralizes the rook\n- Prepares to double rooks on the e-file\n- Maintains flexibility for future plans\n\n```\ne1e4\n```"
