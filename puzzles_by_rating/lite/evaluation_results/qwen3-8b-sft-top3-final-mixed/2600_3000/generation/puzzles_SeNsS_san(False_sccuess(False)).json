When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e4\n- Black has a very active queen on g2 threatening multiple things\n- Black's rook on a3 is very active\n- White's queen on d5 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's queen on g2 is attacking f3 and h1\n- Black's rook on a3 could potentially swing to the kingside\n- White's queen could potentially check on e6 or d6\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g2f3: Immediate threat to win the rook on d2\n- g2h1: Threatening mate on h1\n- a3a5: Preparing to swing the rook to the kingside\n- h5g4: Opening lines against White's king\n\nAfter considering these options, g2f3 seems most forcing:\n- It wins the rook on d2 immediately\n- After Rxf3, Qxf3+ wins the exchange (rook for queen)\n- White can't ignore this threat as it's material winning\n\nOther moves like g2h1 are tempting but White can defend with Qxh1. The rook moves are less forcing.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng2f3\n```"
