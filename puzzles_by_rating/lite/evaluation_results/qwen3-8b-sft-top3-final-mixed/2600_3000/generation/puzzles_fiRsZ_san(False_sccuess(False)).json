When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black is up material but White has some compensation with active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a very dangerous passed pawn on g4 that could promote soon\n- White's queen is very active but needs to be careful about Black's threats\n- Black's rooks are doubled on the d-file, putting pressure on White's position\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black threatens ...Qxc3 winning a pawn\n- Black also threatens ...Rd2+ with a discovered attack on the queen\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4f8: Queen sacrifice to eliminate Black's rook, but after ...Kxf8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- f4b8: Similar idea but less forcing\n- f4f7: Blocking the pawn but allows ...Qxc3\n- f4g5: Defends c3 but allows ...Rd2+ winning the queen\n- h3g4: Capturing the pawn but allows ...Qxc3 with a strong attack\n- g1f1: Moving the king away from checks\n- c1c2: Blocking the rook's attack on the queen\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be c1c2, which:\n- Blocks the rook's attack on the queen\n- Maintains the defense of c3\n- Keeps the queen active\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow Black to maintain too much pressure.\n\n```\nc1c2\n```"
