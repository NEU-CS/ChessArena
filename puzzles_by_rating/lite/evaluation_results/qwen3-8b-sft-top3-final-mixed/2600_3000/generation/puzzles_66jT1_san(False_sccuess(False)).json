When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on g4.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White's queen on c8 is very active\n- Black's rook on f2 is attacking White's rook on c1\n- White's bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: c8d8 looks tempting to attack the black queen\n- Bishop moves: d5f7+ is a forcing check\n- Rook moves: c1c7 to defend the rook and attack the bishop\n- Pawn moves: g4g5 to push the passed pawn\n\n4. Calculating d5f7+:\n- d5f7+ forces the king to move (only to h8)\n- Then c8d8+ wins the queen (king can't take due to rook on f2)\n- After king moves, White can continue attacking\n\n5. Other options:\n- c8d8 immediately allows Black to play Qxd8\n- c1c7 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n- g4g5 is interesting but doesn't address the immediate threats\n\nThe most forcing and winning line is d5f7+, which leads to winning the queen. Here's the move:\n\n```\nd5f7\n```"
