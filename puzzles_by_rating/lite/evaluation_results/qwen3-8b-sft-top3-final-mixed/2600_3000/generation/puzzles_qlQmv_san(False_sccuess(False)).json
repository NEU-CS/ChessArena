When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 3 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Queen, 2 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs no minor pieces)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen is very active on f4, attacking black's king\n   - Black's king is exposed on h6\n   - White has a passed pawn on a3 that could become dangerous\n   - Black's queen on d1 is somewhat trapped\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - h6h7: Moves king away from immediate threats but into potential checks\n   - h6g6: Moves king towards center but still exposed\n   - h6h5: Moves king forward but into more danger\n   - g7g5: Pushes pawn to block queen's attack on king\n\n4. Evaluating g7g5:\n   - Blocks the queen's attack on the king\n   - Creates a potential escape square for the king on g6\n   - Opens the g-file for the rook\n   - After g7g5, if Qxg5+ Kh7, black's king finds safety\n\n5. Other moves leave the king exposed to immediate checks or mate threats:\n   - h6h7 allows Qf7+ winning the rook\n   - h6g6 allows Qg5+ winning the rook\n   - h6h5 allows Qh4+ winning the rook\n\nThe best move is clearly g7g5 as it blocks the queen's attack while improving the king's position.\n\n```\ng7g5\n```"
