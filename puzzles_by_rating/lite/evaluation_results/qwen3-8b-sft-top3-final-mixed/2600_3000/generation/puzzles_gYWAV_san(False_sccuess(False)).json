When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's queen on d4 is very active\n- Black's rook on e7 is under attack by White's rook on d8\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rd7+ next move, winning the rook\n- White could also play Qxe4, winning a pawn and opening lines\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7f7: Moving the rook away from attack while keeping it active\n- e7e8: Blocking the rook's own king from checks\n- c6e8: Blocking with the bishop while developing it\n- e4e3: Pushing the pawn to create counterplay\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- e7f7 seems safest, getting the rook out of attack while maintaining control of the 7th rank\n- e7e8 blocks the king but leaves the rook passive\n- c6e8 is interesting but blocks the bishop's own king\n- e4e3 is too risky as it opens lines for White's pieces\n\nThe best move appears to be moving the rook to f7, where it's safe and maintains pressure on White's position.\n\n```\ne7f7\n```"
