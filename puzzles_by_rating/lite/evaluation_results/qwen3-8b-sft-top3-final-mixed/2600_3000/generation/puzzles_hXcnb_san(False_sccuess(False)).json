When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a passed pawn on b6 that's very dangerous.\n\n2. Immediate threats:\n- White's queen on d6 is attacking the rook on c8\n- White's bishop on d7 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's passed b-pawn is close to promotion\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on a8\n- White has potential mating threats with the queen and bishop coordination\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: Need to save the rook from Qxc8. c8h8 looks tempting to get behind the pawn shield\n- Queen moves: h7h8 seems passive, but maybe h7g7 to defend the rook\n- Bishop moves: e4g6 looks interesting to block the b-pawn's path\n- Pawn moves: f6f5 could be considered to gain space\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- c8h8 seems best to save the rook while getting behind the pawn shield\n- Other rook moves either lose material or leave the rook vulnerable\n- e4g6 is tempting but after b7, the bishop is trapped\n- h7g7 allows Qxc8 winning the rook\n\nThe most resilient move appears to be moving the rook to h8, where it's safer and can potentially participate in defense.\n\n```\nc8h8\n```"
