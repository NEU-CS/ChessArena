When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

It's in the corner and exposed.\n- White king is on g1 \u2014 relatively safe for now.\n\n### Threats:\n- White queen on h7 is eyeing the black king along the 7th rank.\n- White knight on g5 is attacking f7 and h7.\n- Black rook on c2 is deep in White's territory, but not doing much yet.\n- Black queen on f6 is under attack by the White knight on g5.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWe must consider moves that either:\n- Defend the queen on f6,\n- Improve the position of the rook on c2,\n- Or create counterplay.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate some key options:\n\n---\n\n## 1. `f6g7` \u2013 Queen moves to g7\n- This defends the queen from the knight on g5.\n- It also puts pressure on the h-file and supports potential ...h5 ideas.\n- Keeps the queen active and safe.\n\n## 2. `f6f7` \u2013 Queen moves to f7\n- Also defends against Ng5.\n- Places queen on a strong central file.\n- Could support ...e5 or ...d5 breaks.\n\n## 3. `c2c1` \u2013 Rook retreats to c1\n- Removes the rook from danger.\n- Connects with the other rook (if any).\n- But seems passive.\n\n## 4. `c2g2` \u2013 Rook to g2\n- Attacks the White queen on h7.\n- Could force a trade of queens.\n- Might relieve pressure on the black king.\n\n## 5. `f8e8` \u2013 King moves to e8\n- Centralizes the king slightly.\n- Gets off the back rank.\n- But exposes the king further.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Evaluation:\n\nThe most urgent issue is the **queen on f6 being attacked by the knight on g5**. We need to move it somewhere safe and keep it active.\n\nBetween `f6g7` and `f6f7`, both are good. Let's compare:\n\n- `f6g7`: Queen goes to g7, still active, pressures h7, and keeps an eye on the kingside.\n- `f6f7`: Queen to f7, more centralized, supports central play.\n\nBut `f6g7` is more flexible and keeps the queen in a position to threaten White\u2019s king.\n\nAlso, note that after `f6g7`, if White plays `Qxh7`, then `Rxh7` follows, and Black gains material.\n\nSo, this move not only saves the queen but also creates tactical opportunities.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision:\n\n```\nf6g7\n```"
