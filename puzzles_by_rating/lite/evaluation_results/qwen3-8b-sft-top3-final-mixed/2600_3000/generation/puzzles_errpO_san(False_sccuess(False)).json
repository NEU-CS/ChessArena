When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key threats:\n- White's queen on h6 is attacking the g7 pawn (which is only defended by the king)\n- White's rook on h3 is eyeing the h-file\n- White's knight on h5 is threatening to jump to g7 or f6\n\n3. Black's defensive needs:\n- Need to protect the g7 pawn\n- Need to deal with the queen's threats\n- Need to activate pieces\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8f7: Blocks the queen's attack on g7 but leaves the king exposed\n- f6g5: Attacks the queen but allows Qxg5\n- f6e5: Centralizes the knight but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f8f7: Covers g7 but blocks the rook\n- c7f7: Queen moves to defend g7 but blocks the rook\n\nAfter considering these options, the best move appears to be g8f7 because:\n- It directly defends the g7 pawn\n- It maintains the rook's activity on the f-file\n- It prevents any immediate knight forks (like Nf6+)\n- While it does expose the king slightly, it's the most urgent defensive need\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\ng8f7\n```"
