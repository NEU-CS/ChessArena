When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on g7 controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rooks are not well coordinated\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rf3-f8+ next move, winning the rook on e8\n- The bishop on g7 is very strong and needs to be addressed\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8h7: Gets the king away from potential checks but leaves it exposed\n- e8e7: Blocks the bishop's diagonal but allows Rf8+\n- c7e5: Attacks the bishop but allows Bxe5 winning a pawn\n- c5d4: Opens the c-file but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c8d8: Defends the rook but allows Rf8+\n\nAfter considering these, the best move appears to be g8h7, getting the king to relative safety while keeping options to defend the rook next move. The king is more important to save than the rook in this position.\n\n```\ng8h7\n```"
