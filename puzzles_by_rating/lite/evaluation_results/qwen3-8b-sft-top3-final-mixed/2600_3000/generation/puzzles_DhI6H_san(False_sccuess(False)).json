When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong bishop on f6 and queen on f8.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on f8 is attacking the rook on g7\n- White's bishop on f6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's knight on g2 is threatening to fork with Ne3+\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7g8: Rook moves to g8, but then Qxg8+ wins the rook\n- e5e8: Queen takes queen, but after Bxe8 we're still down material\n- g2e3+: Knight fork, but after Qxe3 we lose the knight\n- e5f4: Queen moves to f4, attacking the bishop and defending the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5f4:\n- Defends the rook on g7\n- Attacks the strong bishop on f6\n- Maintains queen activity\n- If Bxf4, then Rxf4 and we're still holding\n- If bishop moves, we maintain pressure\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the threats. e5f4 is the most resilient move.\n\n```\ne5f4\n```"
