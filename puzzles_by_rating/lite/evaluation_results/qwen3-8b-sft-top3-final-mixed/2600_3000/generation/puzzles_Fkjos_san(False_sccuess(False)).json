When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a bishop and a king, while Black has only a king and two pawns (on a5 and e5). The key elements:\n\n- **White King** is on g5, very active.\n- **White Bishop** is on c6, currently attacking the e8 square (which is empty), but can also target other squares.\n- **Black King** is on e3, trying to support its pawns.\n- **Black Pawns**: a5 and e5 \u2014 both are isolated and potentially weak.\n\n### Goal for White:\nTry to win by either:\n- Capturing both pawns and promoting a pawn (but no pawns left for White).\n- Forcing a zugzwang or checkmate.\n\nSince there are no pawns left for White to promote, the goal must be to force a win through tactical precision or zugzwang.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### 1. **c6e8** \u2013 Bishop to e8\n- This attacks the e5 pawn directly.\n- It also controls the long diagonal.\n- After this, Black may have to move the king to defend the pawn.\n\n#### 2. **c6d7** \u2013 Bishop to d7\n- Controls the e6 square, threatening to attack the e5 pawn from another angle.\n- Also keeps pressure on the center.\n\n#### 3. **g5f6** \u2013 King to f6\n- Centralizes the king further.\n- Threatens to go after the e5 pawn.\n- Could lead to a mating net if combined with bishop moves.\n\n#### 4. **g5g6** \u2013 King to g6\n- Pushes toward the kingside.\n- Might help in a mating attack if Black\u2019s king is forced into a corner.\n\n#### 5. **c6b5** \u2013 Bishop to b5\n- Attacks the a5 pawn directly.\n- Forces Black to respond to the threat on the a-pawn.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nLet\u2019s look at **c6b5**, which attacks the a5 pawn directly.\n\n- If Black plays ...Kd4, then White can play Bc4, threatening mate on e6.\n- If Black plays ...Kf4, then White can play Kf6, continuing to press.\n- This move puts immediate pressure on Black and forces a response.\n\nIt\u2019s precise and forces Black into a defensive posture.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\nc6b5\n```"
