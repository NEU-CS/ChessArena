When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on d3 is very active, eyeing the b1-h7 diagonal\n- Black's queen on b2 is attacking White's knight on f2\n- Black's rook on e8 is semi-open\n- White's bishop on g5 is very strong, pinning the f6 pawn to the king\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxb2 next move, winning the queen\n- White could also play Bxf6, opening the position with Black's king exposed\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2f2: Capturing the knight immediately, but after Qxf2, Black's queen is lost\n- b2e2: Defending the e5 pawn and keeping the queen safe\n- e8e7: Moving the rook to defend the back rank\n- g7h6: Moving the bishop to break the pin\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to capture the knight immediately while it's undefended, despite the temporary queen loss, because:\n- After b2f2 Qxf2, Black can play Qxf2 and White must recapture with the rook (Rxf2)\n- Then Black can play Rxe4, winning a pawn and maintaining active play\n- The position remains complicated but Black has good compensation\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nb2f2\n```"
