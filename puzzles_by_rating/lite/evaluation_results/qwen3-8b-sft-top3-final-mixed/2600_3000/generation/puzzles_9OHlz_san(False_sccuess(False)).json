Black's pawns are more advanced and dangerous\n\nKey considerations:\n- White needs to activate the king to stop Black's pawns\n- Pushing kingside pawns (h3-h4, g3-g4) doesn't help the main battle\n- Moving the king towards the queenside is critical\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e3f4 - moves king towards center but away from queenside pawns\n2. e3d3 - moves king towards queenside pawns, better\n3. d4c5 - pawn capture, but after bxc5 Black's pawns become more dangerous\n\nBest move is e3d3, bringing the king closer to stop Black's queenside pawns while maintaining the blockade on d4. Other moves either don't address the main threat or worsen White's position.\n\n```\ne3d3\n```"

It also opens lines for White's king to become more dominant and allows for a plan of pushing `c4-c5` to create a passed pawn.\n\n```\nd3d4\n```"

The key is to evaluate which side has a better chance of promoting a pawn or creating a decisive weakness.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- White\u2019s king is more centralized and active.\n- Black has a pawn majority on the kingside (f5, g5, h7), but they are not yet advanced.\n- White has a passed pawn on the queenside (a4), and a potential passer on c4.\n- Black\u2019s king is slightly more centralized, but White\u2019s king is more active and can support the queenside pawns.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the legal moves list:\n- `d4e3` \u2013 King retreats toward center\n- `d4d3` \u2013 King moves back\n- `d4c3` \u2013 King supports c4 pawn\n- `c4c5` \u2013 Advances c-pawn\n- `h3h4` \u2013 Advances h-pawn\n- `g3g4` \u2013 Advances g-pawn\n\n### Best Plan:\nWhite should aim to create a passed pawn on the queenside and use the king to support its advance. The move `c4c5` is strong because:\n- It creates a passed pawn.\n- It restricts Black\u2019s king from easily approaching the queenside.\n- It opens up the possibility of a pawn breakthrough.\n\nAfter `c4c5`, White can follow up with `Kc3` or `Kd3` to support the pawn, while Black will struggle to stop the pawn without sacrificing tempo.\n\n### Final Move:\n```\nc4c5\n```"
