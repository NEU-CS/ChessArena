When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal, but White has a passed f-pawn that could become dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on c3, controlling the c-file\n- Black's rook is on a5, potentially threatening White's a2 pawn\n- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed\n- White's king is on g1, relatively safe\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: c3c8 looks tempting to attack the black king, but after ...Rc5 the rook might get trapped\n- c3c7 is safer, maintaining control of the 7th rank\n- King moves: g1h2 could be useful to support the h-pawn\n- Pawn moves: h3h4 could be useful to create a passed pawn\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black's rook could play ...Ra1+ at some point, so we should be careful about king safety\n- Black's f7 pawn is weak and could be targeted\n\nAfter considering these factors, the most promising move seems to be c3c7, which:\n- Maintains control of the 7th rank\n- Prevents Black's rook from becoming active on the c-file\n- Prepares potential future checks against the black king\n- Keeps options open for both attacking and defending\n\nOther moves like c3c8 are too risky, while pawn moves don't address the immediate positional needs.\n\n```\nc3c7\n```"
