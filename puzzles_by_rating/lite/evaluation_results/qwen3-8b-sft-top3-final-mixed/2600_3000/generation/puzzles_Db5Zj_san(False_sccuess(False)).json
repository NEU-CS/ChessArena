When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d3\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on d2 that's one square from queening\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that's close to promotion\n- Black's queen is very active on f2, eyeing the white king\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's d2 pawn is threatening to promote (d2d1=Q)\n- Black's queen can deliver checks (Qf2-g2+ or Qf2-h2+)\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves that stop the d2 pawn: Qd3d2 (but this allows Qf2xd2)\n- Qd3xd2 (captures the pawn but loses to Qf2xd2)\n- Qd3h7 (threatening mate on h8, but black can defend)\n- f6f7 (pushing the passed pawn, but black can play Qf2xf7)\n- Rook moves to defend (but none seem effective)\n\n5. Best move appears to be Qd3d2! This:\n- Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n- After Qf2xd2, White can play f6f7 threatening promotion\n- Black's queen is tied down to stopping the pawn\n- White's rook can then potentially join the attack\n\nOther moves either allow the pawn to promote or don't address the immediate threat. While Qd3d2 loses the queen, it's the only way to prevent immediate disaster from the passed pawn.\n\n```\nd3d2\n```"
