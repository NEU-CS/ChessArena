When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pawn on h5 is more advanced.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on c6 is very active\n- Black's rook on a2 is attacking White's king\n- Black has connected passed pawns on c3 and f7\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: c6c8 looks tempting to threaten the f7 pawn\n- King moves: d2e3 to get away from the rook's attack\n- Pawn push: h5h6 to advance the passed pawn\n\n4. Evaluating c6c8:\n- After c6c8, Black can play f7f6 to defend\n- Then White can play h5h6, but Black's c-pawn becomes dangerous\n- Not clearly winning\n\n5. Evaluating d2e3:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- But allows Black to push c3c2, creating a passed pawn\n- White would have to play Rc6xc2, but then Black's rook can become active\n\n6. Evaluating h5h6:\n- Creates an immediate threat to promote\n- Black would likely play f7h7 to block\n- Then White can play Rc6c7, threatening the f7 pawn\n- This seems most promising as it creates multiple threats\n\nAfter careful consideration, h5h6 seems like the most forcing move that creates immediate threats while maintaining activity. The other options either don't create enough threats or allow Black's pawns to become too dangerous.\n\n```\nh5h6\n```"
