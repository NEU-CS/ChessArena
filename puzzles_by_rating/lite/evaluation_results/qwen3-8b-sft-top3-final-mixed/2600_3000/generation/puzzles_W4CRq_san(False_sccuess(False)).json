When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: King, Rook, 2 Bishops, Queen, 2 pawns\n- Black has: King, Rook, 2 Bishops, Queen, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a strong bishop pair and active rook on h3\n- Black's queen is on d6, potentially vulnerable\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f1e2: King move, but doesn't accomplish much\n- h5d1: Queen takes rook, but after ...Qxd1, Black's queen becomes active\n- g5c1: Bishop takes rook, winning the exchange (bishop for rook)\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- g5c1 wins the exchange (bishop for rook) and maintains initiative\n- After Bxc1, Black can recapture with Qxc1, but then White can play Qxd6 winning another queen\n- This leads to a winning endgame with White's extra bishop\n\nThe other moves don't create immediate threats or win material. g5c1 is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\ng5c1\n```"
