When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a rook on b8 threatening Black's rook on f8\n- Black's queen on c5 is very active\n- White's queen on e2 is defending the b5 pawn\n- Black's rook on e4 is active but could be vulnerable\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5a7: Queen takes rook, but after Rxa7 White wins the exchange\n- c5b6: Queen moves to b6, attacking the b5 pawn\n- e4h4: Rook moves to h4, attacking the h-pawn\n- g8h8: King moves to h8, getting away from potential checks\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5b6:\n- Attacks the b5 pawn which is only defended by the queen\n- If White defends with Qd3, then Qxb5 wins a pawn\n- If White plays Qe1 to defend, then Qxb5 is still possible\n- Maintains pressure while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve Black's position as much. The king move g8h8 is too passive.\n\n```\nc5b6\n```"
