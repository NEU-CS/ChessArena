When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

However, White's king is exposed and Black has some active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is on g2 with no pawn cover\n- Black has a rook on c3 attacking the queen on e2\n- Black's queen on a7 is very active\n- White's rook on b5 is pinning the pawn on b7 to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c3c2: Capturing the queen with check, but after Qxc2, Black loses material\n- c3e3: Forking queen and rook, but White can play Qxe3\n- a7a2: Threatening mate on g2, but White can defend with Qxa2\n- e7e8: Moving the knight to safety while maintaining pressure\n- f6f5: Pushing the pawn to open lines against White's king\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3c2+:\n- It forces the queen to take: Qxc2\n- Then Black can play Qxa2+ winning the rook on b5\n- After Kf1, Black has Qxb2 with a strong attack\n- Even though material is lost, the attack on White's exposed king is decisive\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nc3c2\n```"
