When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized knight on g5 and active pieces\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the f8 rook still on its original square\n4. White has threats like Qd2-d4 or Bc1-d2 targeting the d5 bishop\n5. Black's dark-squared bishop on c5 is under pressure from White's pawns\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to safeguard the king position\n- Need to deal with the threat to the d5 bishop\n- Need to activate the rook on f8\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f8e8 - Rook lift to connect rooks and defend e7\n2. d5e4 - Bishop retreat, but allows White to play Qd2-d4\n3. d5c6 - Bishop retreat, but blocks the c-pawn\n4. e7f6 - King move, but exposes to checks\n5. a8e8 - Rook lift, but doesn't address bishop threat\n\nBest move seems to be f8e8 because:\n- Connects the rooks\n- Defends the e7 pawn\n- Prepares to double rooks on the e-file\n- Maintains flexibility for the bishop\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the main threats or create new problems.\n\n```\nf8e8\n```"
