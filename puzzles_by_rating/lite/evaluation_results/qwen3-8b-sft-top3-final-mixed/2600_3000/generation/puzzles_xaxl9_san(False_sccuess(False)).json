When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on d6 that's blockaded by Black's rook on c6\n- Black's king is on a8, somewhat exposed\n- White's king is on e7, very active\n- Black has pawns on f7, h6, g5\n- White has pawns on a7, d6, g3, h3\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could push d6-d7, forcing Black to take with the rook (Rxd7) allowing Kxd7 and White's king becomes very active\n- Black needs to keep the rook active to prevent White's pawn advances\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c6c8: Keeps rook active but allows d6-d7\n- c6c7: Blocks the pawn but allows Kd7\n- c6d6: Captures the pawn but after Kxd6, White's king becomes too active\n- King moves: a8b7 looks interesting to centralize\n- Pawn moves: f7f6 or h6h5 don't seem urgent\n\n5. Best move seems a8b7:\n- Centralizes the king\n- Prepares to support the rook if needed\n- Keeps options open for both rook and king\n- Prevents White from playing Kd7 immediately\n\nOther moves either allow White's king to become too active or don't improve Black's position.\n\n```\na8b7\n```"
