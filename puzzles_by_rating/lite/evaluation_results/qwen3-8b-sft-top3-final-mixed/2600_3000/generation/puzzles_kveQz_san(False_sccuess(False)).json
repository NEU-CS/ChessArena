When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop + pawns vs Black's bishop + pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop is very active on f8\n- Black has a passed pawn on a3 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on f5\n- Black's king is more active (b5) compared to White's (b3)\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: f8g7 looks tempting to attack the g6 pawn\n- King moves: b3c2 to get closer to the a3 pawn\n- Pawn moves: e4e5 to push the passed pawn\n\n4. Evaluating f8g7:\n- Attacks the g6 pawn which is currently defended by the f6 pawn\n- If Black plays ...fxg7, White can recapture with hxg7, opening the h-file\n- But Black could defend with ...Bxg7, though that would be bad for Black as it loses the bishop pair\n\n5. Evaluating b3c2:\n- Gets the king closer to the a3 pawn\n- But allows Black to push ...a2, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- White would then have to play Kxa2, but Black's bishop could become active\n\n6. Evaluating e4e5:\n- Pushes the passed pawn\n- But doesn't address the immediate threats\n- Black could respond with ...Kc5, getting closer to the pawns\n\nAfter considering these options, f8g7 seems the most promising as it:\n- Activates the bishop\n- Creates immediate threats\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't allow Black any easy counterplay\n\nThe other moves either allow Black counterplay or don't improve White's position as much.\n\n```\nf8g7\n```"
