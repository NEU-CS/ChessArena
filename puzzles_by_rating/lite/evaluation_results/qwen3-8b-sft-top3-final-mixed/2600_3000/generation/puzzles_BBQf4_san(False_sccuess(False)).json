When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and pawn (White has R+R+Q vs Black's R+Q). However, Black has a dangerous passed pawn on b2 that's about to promote.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's b2 pawn is one move from queening\n- White has a rook on e6 that's very active\n- Black's queen on b2 is attacking White's queen on f3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b1=Q - promoting immediately, but White can play Qxb1 and we lose the new queen\n- b2a1=Q - underpromotion to avoid immediate capture, but White can still take with Qxa1\n- b2c1 - moving the pawn to safety while maintaining the threat\n- d1e3 - queen move attacking the rook on e6\n\n4. Best option seems to be b2c1:\n- It saves the pawn from immediate capture\n- Maintains the threat of promotion next move\n- The pawn is now protected by the queen\n- White can't take it with Qxc1 because the queen is pinned to the king\n\nAfter b2c1, if White takes with Qxc1, then Qxe6 wins the rook. If White doesn't take, we can promote next move with c1=Q.\n\nOther moves like d1e3 allow White to play Rxe3+ winning the queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb2c1\n```"
