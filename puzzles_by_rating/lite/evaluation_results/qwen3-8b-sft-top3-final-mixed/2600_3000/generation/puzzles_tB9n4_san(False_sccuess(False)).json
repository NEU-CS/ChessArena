When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on c6\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's rook on e6 is very active\n- Black's rook on d8 is under attack by White's bishop on d5\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Bxd8 winning the exchange\n- White could also play Qxf5 winning a pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 - moving the rook to defend the king\n- d8g8 - moving the rook to safety while defending the king\n- g7f7 - moving the king to a safer square\n- c7e7 - moving the queen to defend the rook\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h8g8 seems passive and allows White to maintain pressure\n- d8g8 is better as it defends the king while getting the rook to safety\n- g7f7 leaves the rook hanging to Bxd8\n- c7e7 doesn't address the immediate threat to the rook\n\nThe best move appears to be d8g8, which:\n1. Gets the rook out of attack\n2. Maintains defense of the king\n3. Keeps the rook active on the g-file\n4. Prevents immediate material loss\n\n```\nd8g8\n```"
