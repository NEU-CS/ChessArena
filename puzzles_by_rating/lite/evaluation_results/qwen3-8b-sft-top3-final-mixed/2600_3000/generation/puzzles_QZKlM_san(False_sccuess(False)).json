When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

However, Black has some compensation with active pieces and threats.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on d7 is very active, eyeing the b7 bishop and f7 pawn\n- White's rook on e1 is ready to swing to the kingside\n- Black's bishop on b7 is under attack\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7c8: Retreating the bishop to safety while keeping pressure on d7\n- f6g7: Blocking the queen's diagonal and defending f7\n- b2b3: Pushing the passed pawn, but this seems slow\n- g5f4: Capturing the knight, but after gxf4 White's queen gets more active\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6g7:\n- It blocks the queen's diagonal to b7\n- Defends the f7 pawn\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- After Qxg7, Black can play Bc8 with a reasonable position\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow White to increase pressure. f6g7 is the most solid defensive move that maintains Black's position.\n\n```\nf6g7\n```"
