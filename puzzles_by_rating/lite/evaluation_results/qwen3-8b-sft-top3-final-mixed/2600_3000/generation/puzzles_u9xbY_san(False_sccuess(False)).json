When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and pawns vs White's bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's bishop is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on f8 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's knight on d5 is well placed but needs to be careful about being trapped\n- Black's king is exposed on c4\n- White has a passed pawn on h4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Bxg7 winning a pawn\n- White could push h5-h6 creating a passed pawn\n- White's rook could become active if given time\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Blocks the bishop's diagonal but leaves knight passive\n- d5f6: Attacks the bishop but allows Bxg7\n- g4g5: Pushes the pawn but allows Bxg7\n- c4b5: Moves king away from danger but doesn't address threats\n- g6g5: Creates a passed pawn but weakens structure\n\nAfter considering these, the best move appears to be d5f6:\n- It attacks the bishop, forcing it to move or be captured\n- After Bxg7, we can play Nxg7 and our knight remains active\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It prevents White from playing Bxg7 without consequence\n\nOther moves either allow White to maintain pressure or don't address the immediate threats.\n\n```\nd5f6\n```"
