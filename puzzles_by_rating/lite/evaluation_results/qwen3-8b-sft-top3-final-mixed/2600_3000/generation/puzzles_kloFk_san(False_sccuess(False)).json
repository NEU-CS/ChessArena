When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook, rook, knight, queen vs White's rook, rook, bishop, pawn. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n- Black has a strong knight on d5 attacking c3 and e3\n- Black's queen on a5 is very active\n- White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qd2+ next move, forcing the king to move\n- White's h-pawn is advancing and could promote if not stopped\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6b7: Blocking the h-pawn's advance and attacking the rook\n- d5e3: Forking queen and rook, but White can just take with Qxe3\n- a5a4: Preparing to swing the queen to the kingside\n- g7g6: Creating luft for the king\n\nAfter considering these options, b6b7 seems most important because:\n- It stops White's dangerous passed pawn\n- It attacks White's rook on b1\n- It maintains Black's active piece play\n- It doesn't allow White any immediate counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't address the h-pawn threat or allow White to consolidate. The rook on b7 will be very powerful, controlling the b-file and eyeing White's king.\n\n```\nb6b7\n```"
