When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and knight vs White's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is very active on f7, threatening to penetrate\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h6\n- Black has a passed a-pawn on a6\n- White's rook on h1 is very active\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Kf7-g6, threatening to capture the knight or push the h-pawn\n- White's bishop controls important squares near Black's king\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8h7: Gets the king away from potential checks but doesn't address other threats\n- b6d5: Centralizes the knight and blocks the bishop's diagonal\n- d2h2: Trades rooks but leaves Black's king very exposed\n- a6a5: Advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n\nAfter considering these options, b6d5 seems most promising because:\n- It blocks the bishop's diagonal to h7\n- It centralizes the knight\n- It maintains flexibility for the rook\n- It prevents White's king from advancing further\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new weaknesses. For example, moving the king (h8h7) leaves it exposed, and rook trades (d2h2) are bad due to White's active king.\n\n```\nb6d5\n```"
