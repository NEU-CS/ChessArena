When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's king is exposed on g8 with weak dark squares around it\n3. White has a strong centralized queen on e4 and active pieces\n4. Black's rook on f5 is very active, but potentially overextended\n5. Black's bishop on d7 is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's king safety is a major concern\n- White has potential mating threats against the black king\n- The f5 rook is a key target - if we can attack it while maintaining pressure on the king, that would be ideal\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e4f5 - trading queens would relieve pressure but give up our initiative\n2. f3g5 - threatening mate on f7 while attacking the rook\n3. c1h6 - developing the bishop with threats against the king\n4. e4h4 - bringing the queen closer to the king while attacking the rook\n\nAfter deep consideration:\n- f3g5 is very strong as it threatens Qxf7# while attacking the rook\n- Black's best response would be to move the rook (Rf5-g5) but then we have Qxg5+ with a winning attack\n- If Black tries to defend with something like Qd8, we can play Qxg5+ Kxg5 Bxh6 with a decisive material advantage\n\nThis move maintains maximum pressure while creating immediate threats against the black king.\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
