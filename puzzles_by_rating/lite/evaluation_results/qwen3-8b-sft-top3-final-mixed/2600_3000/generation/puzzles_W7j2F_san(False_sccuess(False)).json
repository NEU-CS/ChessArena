When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized queen on e5 and bishop on c4\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. Black's knight on d4 is very active but potentially loose\n5. White has threats like Qxd4 or Bxd4 winning material\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on d4 is attacked by both the queen and bishop\n- If we move the knight, we need to maintain our active piece play\n- We should consider defending our king while developing counterplay\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d4f3 - Forking queen and bishop, but after Qxf3 we lose material\n2. d4e6 - Retreating the knight, but it's passive\n3. d4b5 - Moving the knight to a safer square while maintaining pressure\n4. f8e7 - Developing the bishop to defend the king\n5. d8e7 - Connecting rooks and defending the knight\n\nAfter careful consideration, d4b5 seems best because:\n- It saves the knight from immediate capture\n- The knight remains active on b5\n- It doesn't block our dark-squared bishop\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves either lose material or are too passive. The knight on b5 can later jump to d6 or a7 depending on how the position develops.\n\n```\nd4b5\n```"
