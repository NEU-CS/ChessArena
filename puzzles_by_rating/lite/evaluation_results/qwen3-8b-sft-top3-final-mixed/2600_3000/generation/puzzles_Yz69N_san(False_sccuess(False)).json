When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, knight. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on c6 is very active, attacking f7 and e8\n- Black's queen on b4 is threatening White's rook on d2\n- Black's knight on c3 is forking White's rook on d2 and bishop on f4\n- White's rook on d2 is under attack from both Black's queen and knight\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: c6e8+ looks tempting as it forks king and rook\n- Rook moves: d2d8+ is a check that wins the rook on f8\n- Bishop moves: f4h6 threatens mate on g7\n- Defending the rook: d2d1 or f4g5\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- c6e8+ Kf7 (forced) Qxf8 wins the rook, but after Qxf8 Rxf8, White is up a piece\n- d2d8+ Qxd8 Bxd8 wins the queen, but after Rxd8, material is equal\n- f4h6 threatens mate, but Black can defend with g7g6\n- d2d1 defends but is passive\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is c6e8+, which wins material decisively. After:\n1. Qe8+ Kf7 (only move)\n2. Qxf8 Rxf8\nWhite is up a queen for a rook and knight, which is a winning advantage.\n\n```\nc6e8\n```"
