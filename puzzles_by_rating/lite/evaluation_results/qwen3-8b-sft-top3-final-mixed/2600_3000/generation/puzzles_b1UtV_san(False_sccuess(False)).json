When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: 2 Rooks, Queen, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with knight vs no minor pieces)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on a5 is very active, eyeing the b6 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on c7\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black has a passed pawn on g5\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c7b8: King moves to b8, getting away from potential checks\n- c7d7: King moves towards center, but still exposed\n- b7b6: Pawn moves, but allows Qxb6 winning a pawn\n\n4. Threats:\n- White could play Qxb6 winning a pawn\n- White could play Qa7+ forcing the king to move\n\n5. Best move:\n- b7b6 is too risky as it loses a pawn\n- c7d7 keeps the king more active but still exposed\n- c7b8 is safest, getting the king away from potential checks and towards the corner where it's slightly safer\n\nAfter considering all options, c7b8 is the most prudent move, keeping the king safe while maintaining material balance.\n\n```\nc7b8\n```"
