When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on d2\n- Black's rook is on b1, potentially threatening White's pawns\n- Black's king is centralized on f5\n- White's king is on f3, somewhat exposed\n- Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on d4 and g5, Black has connected passed pawns on a5 and b5\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's rook could capture b2 pawn with Rxb2\n- Black's king could advance to support the pawns (e.g. Kf5-e4)\n- White needs to be careful about king safety\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f3g2: King moves towards center but exposes to checks\n- d2d3: Defends b2 pawn but blocks d-pawn\n- d2h2: Rook moves to h-file, potentially supporting g-pawn\n- g5g6: Advances passed pawn but may be premature\n- d4d5: Advances central pawn, gains space\n\nAfter considering these, the most important priorities are:\n1) Defend the b2 pawn\n2) Keep the rook active\n3) Advance passed pawns carefully\n\nThe best move appears to be d2d3, which:\n- Defends the b2 pawn\n- Keeps the rook active on the d-file\n- Maintains flexibility for future play\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the b2 pawn threat or are too passive.\n\n```\nd2d3\n```"
