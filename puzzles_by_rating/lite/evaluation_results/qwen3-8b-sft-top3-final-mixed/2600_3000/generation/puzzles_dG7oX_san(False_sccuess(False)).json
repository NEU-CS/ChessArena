When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: King, Bishop, Pawn (on c7)\n- Black has: King, Knight, Pawn (on a4), Pawn (on f2)\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has bishop vs knight, but Black has two pawns)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's pawn on c7 is very dangerous and close to promotion\n- Black's pawn on f2 is also close to promotion\n- White's king is active on c5\n- Black's king is on f3, somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f2f1q (promoting the pawn immediately)\n- c8 moves (knight moves)\n- f3 moves (king moves)\n\n4. Analysis:\n- If we promote f2f1q, White can play c7c8q and we're in a queen endgame where White's queen is more active\n- The knight moves don't seem to accomplish much\n- King moves like f3g4 or f3e4 might be better to activate the king\n\n5. Best option:\n- f3g4 seems most promising, activating the king towards the center and potentially helping stop White's pawn while also supporting our own pawns\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is to activate the king:\n\n```\nf3g4\n```"
