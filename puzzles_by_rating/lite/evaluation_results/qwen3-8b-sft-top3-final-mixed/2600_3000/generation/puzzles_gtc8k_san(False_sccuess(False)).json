When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop, rook, queen vs Black's bishop, knight, rook. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on f4 is very active, attacking the black queen on d4\n- Black's queen is pinned to the king by White's bishop on e6\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5 that could become dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but not in immediate danger\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4f8: Rook sacrifice to win the bishop pair, but after ...Kxf8 White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- e6g8: Bishop sacrifice to remove the defender of the f7 pawn, but Black can play ...Kxg8 and White doesn't have enough compensation\n- f4f7: Attacking the bishop while maintaining pressure on the queen\n- c2f5: Developing the queen with tempo against the pinned queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be f4f7:\n- Maintains pressure on the pinned queen\n- Attacks the bishop on g7\n- If Black moves the queen, White can play Qxd4 winning material\n- If Black takes the rook with ...Bxf7, then Qxd4 wins the queen\n- If Black plays ...Kg8, then Qxd4 is still strong\n\nOther moves either don't maintain the pin or allow Black to consolidate. f4f7 keeps maximum pressure while maintaining all of White's advantages.\n\n```\nf4f7\n```"
