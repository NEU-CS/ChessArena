When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a very active rook on h8 and queen on h2\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n- Black's bishop on f6 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on d3\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Qh8+ next move if we don't address it\n- The e5 pawn is threatening to advance\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8e8 - getting the king away from checks\n- a8e8 - blocking the rook's attack with the rook\n- f6d8 - moving the pinned bishop\n- b4c6 - developing the knight\n\nAfter considering these:\n- f8e8 looks safest, getting the king away from potential checks\n- a8e8 blocks the rook but leaves the king exposed\n- f6d8 allows Qh8+ winning the bishop\n- b4c6 doesn't address the immediate threats\n\nThe best move appears to be moving the king to e8, getting away from potential checks while keeping the rook defended.\n\n```\nf8e8\n```"
