When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's rook, bishop, knight. Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h8 is extremely powerful, attacking the black king on e7 and rook on g6\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- Black's queen on f5 is unprotected and could be a target\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: h8g8+ forces the king to move (only to f7), then we can play Qxg6 winning material\n- Bishop moves: g2b7 threatens the rook on a8, but black can defend with ...Qd5\n- Pawn moves: e5e6 is tempting to push the passed pawn, but allows ...fxe6 opening lines for black\n\n4. The most forcing and winning move appears to be h8g8+, which:\n- Forces the king to f7 (only legal move)\n- Then we can play Qxg6 winning the rook\n- After Kxg6, we have Bxg6+ winning the queen\n\nHere's the move sequence:\n1. Qg8+ Kf7\n2. Qxg6 Kxg6\n3. Bxg6+ Kf7\n4. Bxf5 and White is up a rook and pawn\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh8g8\n```"
