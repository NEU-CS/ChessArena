When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed on f8 with limited pawn cover\n3. White has a strong bishop on c6 that's very active\n4. Black's queen on e7 is somewhat awkwardly placed, defending multiple weaknesses\n5. White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) Bishop moves:\n- c6e8+ looks tempting as it forks king and rook, but after ...Kxe8 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- c6d7 attacks the queen but allows ...Qxd7\n- c6b7 threatens the rook but can be defended\n\nB) Queen moves:\n- b3e6 is very strong, attacking the queen and threatening mate on f7\n  After ...Qxe6, White can play Bxe6 with a strong attack\n  Black's best is probably ...Qd8, but then Bxd8 Rxd8 and White has compensation\n\nC) Rook moves:\n- a1e1 looks interesting to double rooks on the e-file\n- f1e1 is less effective as the e-file isn't fully open\n\nD) Pawn moves:\n- d4d5 pushes the passed pawn but may be premature\n- g4g5 could be considered to open lines against Black's king\n\nAfter careful consideration, b3e6 seems the most forcing and dangerous move, creating immediate threats against Black's king position while maintaining material equality. It forces Black to react to the queen threat while keeping White's initiative.\n\n```\nb3e6\n```"
