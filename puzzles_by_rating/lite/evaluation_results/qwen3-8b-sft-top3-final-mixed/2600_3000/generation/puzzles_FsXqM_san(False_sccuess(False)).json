When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns vs Black's Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on h7 is very active, threatening to penetrate the 7th rank\n- Black's rook on e4 is active but can be challenged\n- Black's bishop on d1 is very dangerous, eyeing the b3 pawn and potentially the a2 pawn\n- White's bishop on b4 is controlling important squares but could be more active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7h8: Rook lift to h8, threatening to invade the 8th rank\n- b4c5: Bishop moves to c5, attacking the f8 square and potentially the e4 rook\n- b4b5: Bishop moves to b5, controlling more space\n- h4h5: Pushing the pawn to h5, gaining space\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is ...Bxb3, winning a pawn\n- After ...Bxb3, White can play Rxe4 but then Black has Bxa2 winning another pawn\n\n5. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to prevent ...Bxb3 while maintaining activity\n- b4c5 looks interesting as it attacks the e4 rook and prevents ...Bxb3 (as the bishop would be pinned to the rook)\n\nAfter considering these factors, b4c5 seems like the most principled move:\n- It develops the bishop to a more active square\n- It attacks the e4 rook\n- It prevents ...Bxb3 by pinning the bishop to the rook\n- It maintains White's active piece play\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nb4c5\n```"
