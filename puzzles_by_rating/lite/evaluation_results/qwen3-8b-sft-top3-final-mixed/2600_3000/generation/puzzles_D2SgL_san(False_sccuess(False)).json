When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has a queen vs White's rook + bishop + pawn, but Black has doubled rooks on the d-file)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g4 is very active and threatening\n- White's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced\n- Black has a strong bishop pair\n- White has a passed pawn on f5\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen is attacking g2 pawn\n- Black could play ...Qxg2+ winning a pawn\n- Black's rooks are eyeing the d-file\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Defending g2: h3 or g3\n- Counterplay with f5-f6\n- Developing pieces (like c2-c4)\n- Blocking the queen's attack on g2\n\nAfter considering:\n- h3 seems passive and allows Black to maintain pressure\n- g3 weakens the kingside\n- f5-f6 is tempting but may be premature\n- c2-c4 develops a piece and blocks the queen's diagonal\n\nThe best move appears to be c2-c4, which:\n- Develops the bishop\n- Blocks the queen's diagonal to g2\n- Maintains control of d5\n- Prepares potential queenside expansion\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nc2c4\n```"
