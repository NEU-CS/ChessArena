When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen vs Black's Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on b5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with weak dark squares around it\n- White's queen is very active on b3\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning the knight on e4 to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7a8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, threatening to penetrate\n- e4f6: Knight sacrifice to open up Black's king\n- d2h6: Queen move threatening mate on h7\n- b5b6: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Deep analysis:\n- e4f6 looks tempting: after gxf6, Qh6+ Kf8 Qh7+ Ke8 Qxh8+ Kd7, White wins the queen but Black gets counterplay\n- d2h6 is strong: threatens mate on h7, Black must respond with g6 (h5 is too slow)\n- After d2h6 g6, White can play Qxh5 with a strong attack\n\n5. Best continuation seems to be d2h6, forcing Black to weaken their position to defend against mate threats. This maintains White's initiative and keeps Black on the defensive.\n\n```\nd2h6\n```"
