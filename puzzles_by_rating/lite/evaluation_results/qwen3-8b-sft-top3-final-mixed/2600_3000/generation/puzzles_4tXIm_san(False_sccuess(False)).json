When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have pawns only)\n2. White has a passed pawn on d5, but it's blockaded by Black's e5 pawn\n3. Black's king is more active (h3 vs White's f3)\n4. White's pawn structure is slightly better with connected passed pawns on the queenside\n5. Black's pawns are more scattered\n\nKey considerations:\n- White's main threat is to push the d-pawn (d5-d6) to create a passed pawn\n- Black needs to either stop this or create counterplay\n- The h3-h4 push could be interesting to create a passed pawn on the kingside\n- The e5-e4 push would open lines but might be premature\n\nLooking at the candidate moves:\n- h3h4: Creates a passed pawn but might be too slow\n- h3h2: Doesn't accomplish much\n- c7c6: Prepares to challenge White's queenside pawns but allows d5-d6\n- b7b6: Similar to c7c6 but less effective\n- a6a5: Doesn't help much\n- e5e4: Opens the position but gives White's king more scope\n- c7c5: Challenges White's center immediately\n- b7b5: Creates a passed pawn but leaves c6 weak\n\nThe most principled move seems to be c7c5, challenging White's central pawn immediately. This:\n1. Prevents d5-d6\n2. Opens lines for potential counterplay\n3. Maintains flexibility\n4. Keeps the position balanced\n\nAfter c7c5, if White takes (dxc5), Black can recapture with bxc5, creating connected passed pawns on the queenside. If White doesn't take, Black can continue developing counterplay.\n\n```\nc7c5\n```"
