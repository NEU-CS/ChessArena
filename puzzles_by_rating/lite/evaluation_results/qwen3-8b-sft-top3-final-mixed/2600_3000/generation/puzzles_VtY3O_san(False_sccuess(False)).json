When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, rook, queen and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on d5 is very strong, attacking f6 and e7 squares\n- Black's queen on c2 is threatening to capture the rook on d1\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Forking king and rook, but after ...Kf7 the knight is trapped\n- d5f6: Attacking the pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- e1e4: Blocking the queen's attack on the rook while developing the rook\n- d1d4: Moving the rook to safety while attacking the c4 pawn\n- e5e6: Pushing the pawn to create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e4:\n- It blocks the queen's attack on the rook\n- The rook becomes active on the 4th rank\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It doesn't allow Black any immediate counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat to the rook or allow Black counterplay. e1e4 is the most solid and active choice.\n\n```\ne1e4\n```"
