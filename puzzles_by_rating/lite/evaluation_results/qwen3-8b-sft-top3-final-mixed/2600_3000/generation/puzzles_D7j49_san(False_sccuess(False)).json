When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has king + pawns (g6, h7, c6, e4) vs White's king + rook + pawns (a2, g2, h3). White is up a rook, which is a decisive material advantage.\n\n2. Immediate threats:\n- White's rook on a5 is attacking Black's pawn on c6\n- White's king is close to Black's pawns\n- Black's rook on f4 is active but not immediately threatening anything\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White could potentially create mating threats if Black's king stays exposed\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h8: Moves king to corner but still exposed\n- g7g8: Similar to h8\n- f4f8: Rook retreat to defend c6 pawn\n- f4f7: Rook defends c6 pawn while staying active\n- e4e3: Pushes passed pawn but allows White to capture with rook\n\n5. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to defend the c6 pawn which is under attack\n- f4f7 seems best as it defends c6 while keeping the rook active\n- Other rook moves either don't defend c6 or leave it vulnerable\n\n6. Other considerations:\n- Pushing pawns (g6g5, h7h6 etc.) don't address the immediate threat\n- King moves don't solve the c6 pawn issue\n\nAfter careful consideration, f4f7 is the most principled move, defending the c6 pawn while keeping the rook active and safe from immediate capture.\n\n```\nf4f7\n```"
