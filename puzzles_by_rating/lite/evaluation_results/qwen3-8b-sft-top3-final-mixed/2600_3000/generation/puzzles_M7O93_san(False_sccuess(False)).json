When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (king + pawns). White has pawns on a3, c4, d5, h6. Black has pawns on a5, b5, c5, f5.\n\n2. King positions: White king is on f4, Black king on f6. Both kings are active in the center.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - White's h6 pawn is passed but blockaded by Black's f5 pawn.\n   - Black's a5 and b5 pawns are connected and can advance.\n   - White's c4 pawn is blockaded by Black's c5 pawn.\n   - White's d5 pawn is blockaded by Black's f5 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - f6f7: King moves forward, but doesn't accomplish much\n   - f6e7: King moves toward center, but away from action\n   - f6g6: King moves toward h6 pawn, but White can defend it\n   - f6e6: King moves toward center, but doesn't help pawns\n   - b5b4: Advances pawn, but allows White to play cxb4\n   - a5a4: Advances pawn, creating a passed pawn\n\nThe most promising move is a5a4, creating a passed pawn that will require White to divert resources to stop it. After a5a4, White will likely have to play bxa4, then Black can play b5b4, creating another passed pawn. This pawn race could be decisive.\n\n```\na5a4\n```"
