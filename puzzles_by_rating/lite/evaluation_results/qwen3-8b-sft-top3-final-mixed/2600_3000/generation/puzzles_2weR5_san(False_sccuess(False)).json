When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has strong attacking potential with queen on g5 and rook on d1 eyeing the d-file\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White's bishop on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n\nKey threats to consider:\n- White could play Qxg7 winning the rook\n- White could play Rd8+ winning the queen\n- White could play Qxh7 winning a pawn with tempo\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h8g8 - moves the rook to defend g7 but allows Qxh7\n2. f8e7 - blocks the queen's path to g7 but allows Rd8+ winning the queen\n3. e8e7 - blocks the queen's path to g7 and defends the rook\n4. d7e7 - blocks the queen's path to g7 and defends the rook\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e8e7 seems best as it blocks the queen's path to g7 while keeping the rook defended\n- It also maintains the option to castle queenside if needed\n- Other moves either lose material immediately or allow devastating attacks\n\nThe move e8e7 addresses the most immediate threats while maintaining some defensive coordination.\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
