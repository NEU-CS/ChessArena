When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is more active (d3 vs black's king on e6)\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - White has pawns on a4, b3, c4, g5\n   - Black has pawns on a5, c5, g6\n4. White's g-pawn is more advanced than black's g-pawn\n5. Black's king is currently blocking white's g-pawn\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d3e4 - King moves toward center and black's pawns\n2. d3e3 - King moves toward black's pawns\n3. d3c3 - King moves toward queenside pawns\n4. b3b4 - Advances queenside pawn\n\nAnalysis:\n- d3e4 looks most promising as it centralizes the king and threatens to attack black's c5 pawn\n- After d3e4, black would likely play e6f6 to defend the g-pawn\n- Then white can continue with e4d5, putting pressure on black's pawns\n- Other king moves don't create immediate threats\n- b3b4 is too slow and allows black to consolidate\n\nThe most active and aggressive move is d3e4, putting pressure on black's position and maintaining the initiative.\n\n```\nd3e4\n```"
