When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on d7 controlling key squares\n- Black's queen on b3 is under attack by White's rook on d1\n- Black's king is exposed on h5\n- White's queen on d4 is very active\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxb3 winning the queen\n- White could also play Qxh7 winning a pawn and threatening mate\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b3g8: Queen moves to safety while attacking the rook\n- b3f7: Queen moves to safety while attacking the knight\n- b3e6: Queen moves to safety while attacking the queen\n- h5h6: King moves away from potential checks\n- c8c1: Rook moves to defend the queen\n\nAfter considering these options, b3g8 seems most promising because:\n- It saves the queen while attacking the rook\n- After Rxb3, Qxb3 wins the rook back\n- It maintains material equality while improving the queen's position\n- It prevents immediate threats to the king\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats as effectively.\n\n```\nb3g8\n```"
