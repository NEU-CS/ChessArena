When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen on d4 is very active and threatening\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on h5 that could become dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on g5 that could be advanced\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's queen is attacking the rook on c3\n- Black's rook on h3 is eyeing the g3 pawn\n- Black's bishop on f6 is controlling important squares\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c3c8: Rook lift to attack the king, but black can defend with Qd7\n- d2f4: Queen moves to attack the bishop, but allows Qxg5\n- g5g6: Pushing the passed pawn, but black can respond with Qxg5\n- d2e3: Blocking the queen's attack on the rook while defending g5\n- g1g2: Moving the king to safety\n\nAfter careful consideration, d2e3 seems best because:\n- It defends the rook on c3\n- It defends the g5 pawn\n- It blocks the queen's attack\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow black to maintain too much pressure.\n\n```\nd2e3\n```"
