When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on b6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White's rook on c5 is very active\n- Black's knight on d6 is well placed but could be harassed\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rc7+ next move, forcing the king to move and allowing Rxb7\n- White's bishop controls important squares near Black's king\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Gets the king to safety but allows Rc7+ anyway\n- d6e4: Centralizes the knight and blocks the bishop's diagonal\n- d6f5: Attacks the h4 pawn but leaves the knight exposed\n- d7d8: Rook lift to potentially defend the 7th rank\n\nAfter considering these options, d6e4 seems most promising because:\n- It blocks the bishop's diagonal\n- It centralizes the knight\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It prevents Rc7+ ideas as the knight covers c7\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new weaknesses. For example, moving the king allows Rc7+ anyway, and rook moves don't solve the immediate problems.\n\n```\nd6e4\n```"
