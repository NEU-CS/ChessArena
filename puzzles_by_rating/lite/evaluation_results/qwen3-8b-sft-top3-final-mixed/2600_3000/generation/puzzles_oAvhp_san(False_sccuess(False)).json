When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has pawns on d5 and e5, White has pawns on e4 and g4.\n- There is tension around the center, especially with the bishop pair for Black.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the list of legal moves, we focus on the most promising ones:\n\n#### 1. **Castling (e8g8 or e8c8)**\n- **e8g8 (O-O)**: Safe, gets king off the open file, connects rooks.\n- **e8c8 (O-O-O)**: Also safe, but less common here due to lack of queenside development.\n\n#### 2. **Developing the bishop:**\n- **c5f8**: Retreats the bishop to f8, not ideal.\n- **c5e7**: Develops the bishop to e7, supports castling.\n- **c5d6**: Attacks the knight on c3, but may be premature.\n\n#### 3. **Knight moves:**\n- **f6g8**: Retreats the knight, not useful.\n- **f6h7**: Attacks the g5 square, but not much follow-up.\n- **f6d7**: Centralizes the knight, but blocks the queen.\n\n#### 4. **Pawn moves:**\n- **g7g6**: Prepares to fianchetto the bishop, but weakens dark squares.\n- **h6h5**: Prevents Bg5, but weakens the kingside.\n- **e5e4**: Pushes in the center, but could be met with dxe4.\n\n---\n\n## Best Plan:\nThe best plan for Black is to **castle kingside (e8g8)**. It improves king safety, connects the rooks, and prepares for further development.\n\nCastling also avoids potential threats from White\u2019s bishop on b5 and knight on c3, which could target the center or queenside if Black delays castling.\n\n---\n\n## Final Move:\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
