When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on a7, attacking the rook on d8 and bishop on b7\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a passed pawn on g5 that could become dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that's close to promotion\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7b8: Queen takes bishop with check, but after ...Kd7 the queen is trapped\n- a7a8: Queen takes rook, but after ...Qxa8 White loses the queen for rook\n- b4d6: Bishop takes knight with check, but after ...Kxd6 the king becomes more active\n- g5g6: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n- e1e7: Rook takes pawn with check, but after ...Kxe7 the king escapes\n\n4. Best move seems to be a7b7:\n- Queen takes bishop with check\n- Black must play ...Kd7 (only legal move)\n- Then White can play Qxb7+ Kc8\n- Now White can play Qxa8 winning the rook\n- Black can't stop both the queen and the passed g-pawn\n\nThis sequence wins material while keeping the initiative. Other moves either don't win material or allow Black to consolidate.\n\n```\na7b7\n```"
