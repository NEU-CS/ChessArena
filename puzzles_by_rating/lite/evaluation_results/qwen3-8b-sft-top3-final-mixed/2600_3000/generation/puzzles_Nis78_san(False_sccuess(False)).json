When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on a4\n- Black's knight on f6 is very active\n- Black has connected passed pawns on c5 and d6\n- White's bishop on f5 is blocked by its own pawn on g4\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black threatens ...d5, opening lines against White's king\n- Black could also play ...Ne4+ with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: f5d7 looks interesting, attacking the d6 pawn\n- King moves: a4b5 seems dangerous as it walks into potential knight forks\n- Pawn moves: a4a5 might be playable to gain space\n\n5. Best options:\n- f5d7: Attacks the d6 pawn, but after ...Kd7 the bishop is trapped\n- a4a5: Gains space but doesn't address the material deficit\n- f5g6: Retreats the bishop to safety while keeping it active\n\nAfter considering these, f5g6 seems most prudent:\n- Gets the bishop to safety\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- Prevents immediate knight forks\n- Keeps options open for future play\n\nThe other moves either lose material or don't improve White's position.\n\n```\nf5g6\n```"
