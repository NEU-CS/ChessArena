When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and 3 pawns vs Black's bishop and 3 pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f5, but Black's king is also exposed on c6. Both kings are vulnerable to checks.\n\n3. Key features:\n   - Black's bishop on e7 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal\n   - White's rook on b5 is active but could be more effective\n   - Black has a passed pawn on b4 that could become dangerous\n   - White's pawn on a4 is under attack by Black's pawn on b4\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - b5b6: Attacks the c6 king and threatens to win material\n   - f5e6: Centralizes the king and attacks the bishop\n   - b5e5: Pins the bishop to the king\n   - a4a5: Pushes the pawn but leaves it vulnerable\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- b5b6 looks very strong as it forces the king to move (Kc6xb6 is impossible due to the pawn on b4). If Kd6, then Rb6+ wins the bishop.\n- f5e6 is also good but allows Black to play ...Bf6 defending.\n- b5e5 is interesting but Black can play ...Kd6 defending.\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is b5b6, which wins material by force.\n\n```\nb5b6\n```"
