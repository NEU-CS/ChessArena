When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook, bishop, knight vs White's rook, bishop, pawn. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on f1\n- Black has a knight on h4 attacking f3 and g2\n- Black's rook on g2 is very active, pinning White's bishop on b3 to the king\n- White has a passed pawn on a6 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4f3: Forking king and rook, but after Kxf3 Rxb3+ wins the bishop\n- g2g1: Threatening mate in 1 (Rg1#)\n- e3f4: Blocking the bishop's defense of g2\n- f6f5: Pushing the pawn to create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be g2g1, delivering an immediate mate threat. White has no way to prevent Rg1# next move. Even if they try to block with something like Ke2, then Nh4-f3+ wins the rook.\n\nOther moves like h4f3 are good but not as forcing. The mate threat is decisive.\n\n```\ng2g1\n```"
