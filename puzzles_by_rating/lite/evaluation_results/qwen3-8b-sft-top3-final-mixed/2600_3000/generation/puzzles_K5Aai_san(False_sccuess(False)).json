When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and queen vs Black's two rooks, queen and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h4 is very active, eyeing the h7 pawn and potentially threatening mate on h7\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black's queen on e7 is defending h7 but also blocks the rook on f8\n- White has a passed pawn on e4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4h7: Immediate queen sacrifice to force mate (Qxh7 Rxh7 Rxh7#)\n- d5d6: Pushing the passed pawn, but Black can blockade with ...Qe6\n- f3e5: Centralizing the knight, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- g5h6: Bishop sacrifice to open the king, but Black can play ...gxh6\n\n4. The most forcing and decisive move appears to be h4h7, which leads to a forced mate:\n- After 1. Qxh7 Rxh7 2. Rxh7# (the rook on d5 covers the escape squares)\n\nThis is the most direct path to victory, as other moves allow Black to defend or even counterattack. The queen sacrifice is sound because it leads to immediate checkmate.\n\n```\nh4h7\n```"
