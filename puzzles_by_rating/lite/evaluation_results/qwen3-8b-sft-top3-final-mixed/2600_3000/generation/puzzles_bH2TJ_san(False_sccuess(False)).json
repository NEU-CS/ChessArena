When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, knight vs Black's queen, rook, rook, bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on g7 is very active, attacking the rook on g8 and threatening mate on h8\n- Black's queen on e3 is unprotected and vulnerable\n- Black's king is exposed on b6\n- White has a passed pawn on g3 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h8 (Qxh8+) - immediate check, but after ...Kxh8 White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- f1f7 (Rxf7) - wins the exchange but allows Black counterplay\n- c2h7 (Bxh7) - threatens mate but Black can defend with ...Qxh7\n- b3c5 (Nc5+) - discovered check that wins the queen!\n\nAfter deeper analysis, b3c5+ (Nc5+) is the strongest move:\n- It's a discovered check from the bishop on c2\n- Black must take the knight with the king (Kxc5)\n- Then White plays Qxh8+ winning the rook on g8\n- Even if Black tries ...Qxc5, White has Bxh7 winning the queen\n\nThis sequence wins material decisively while maintaining the initiative.\n\n```\nb3c5\n```"
