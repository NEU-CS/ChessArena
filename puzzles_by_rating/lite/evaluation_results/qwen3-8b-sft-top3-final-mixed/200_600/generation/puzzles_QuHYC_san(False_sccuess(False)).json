When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has:\n\n- A rook on b3\n- A rook on c2\n- A bishop on b2\n- A pawn on f4\n- A pawn on g2\n- A pawn on h2\n- A king on h1\n\nBlack has:\n\n- A rook on e8\n- A king on a6\n\nWhite to move.\n\n---\n\n## Key Observations:\n\n1. **Material is roughly equal**, but White has more active pieces.\n2. **White\u2019s king is in the corner**, which can be dangerous if Black gets counterplay.\n3. **Black\u2019s king is on a6**, quite far from the action.\n4. **White has a passed pawn on f4**, which could become a threat.\n5. **The rooks on the 2nd rank (b3, c2)** are well placed for potential activity along files or ranks.\n6. **The bishop on b2** is somewhat restricted but can become active depending on how the position opens up.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Moves:\n\nWe'll evaluate some of the most promising options:\n\n### 1. `b3b8` \u2013 Rook to b8\n- This attacks the black rook on e8 via the open file.\n- It also threatens to double rooks on the 8th rank.\n- However, it may not be immediately decisive.\n\n### 2. `b3b7` \u2013 Rook to b7\n- Attacks the black king directly.\n- Forces the black king to move.\n- Could lead to a forced sequence where White gains space or material.\n\n### 3. `c2c8` \u2013 Rook to c8\n- Similar idea as above; doubles rooks on the 8th rank.\n- Might be useful if supported by other pieces.\n\n### 4. `b2c3` \u2013 Bishop to c3\n- Develops the bishop to a more active diagonal.\n- Eyes the long diagonal toward the black king.\n- Could support a future attack.\n\n### 5. `f4f5` \u2013 Pawn push\n- Advances the passed pawn.\n- Opens lines and creates space.\n- May help activate the rooks and bishop.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Analysis:\n\nLet\u2019s focus on **`b3b7`**:\n\n- **Rook to b7** puts pressure on the black king.\n- The black king is on a6, so moving to b7 threatens to cut off escape squares.\n- After `b3b7`, Black must respond to avoid losing the king.\n- Possible replies:\n  - `Ka5` \u2013 then `Rc7` follows, tightening the net.\n  - `Kb6` \u2013 then `Rb6+` wins the king.\n  - `Rc8` \u2013 then `Rxc8 Kxc8`, and White still has a strong position.\n\nThis move starts a **forced sequence** that leads to a favorable outcome for White.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision:\n\n```\nb3b7\n```"
