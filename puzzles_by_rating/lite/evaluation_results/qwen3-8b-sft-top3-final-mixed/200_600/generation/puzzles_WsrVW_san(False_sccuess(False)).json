When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h5\n- Black's rook on a2 is very active, attacking the bishop on f2\n- White's rook on g5 is very active, eyeing the g7 pawn\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rg5-g7 next move, threatening to win the f7 pawn\n- White's bishop on f3 is controlling important squares\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a2a1: Protects the bishop but seems passive\n- a2h2: Attacks the h5 pawn but allows Rg5xh5\n- f8g8: Gets the king to safety but allows Rg5-g7\n- c4b5: Blocks the rook's path to the bishop while attacking the pawn\n- e6e5: Creates luft for the king but gives up central control\n\nAfter considering these options, c4b5 seems most promising because:\n- It blocks the rook's path to the bishop\n- It attacks the b4 pawn which is currently undefended\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n- It doesn't allow any immediate tactical blows from White\n\nOther moves either allow White to gain material or don't address the positional needs.\n\n```\nc4b5\n```"
