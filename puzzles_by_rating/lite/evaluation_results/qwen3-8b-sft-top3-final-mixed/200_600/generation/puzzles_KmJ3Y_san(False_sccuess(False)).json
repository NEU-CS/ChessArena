When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (f6), Bishop (f5), pawns (b4, g4, h3, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (a2), Bishop (c7), Bishop (f1), pawns (h6)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on f6 is very active, attacking the h6 pawn\n- Black's rook on a2 is threatening to capture the b4 pawn\n- Black's bishop on f1 is pinning White's rook on h1 to the king\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h3\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h3h4: Moves the king away from potential checks, but doesn't address the threats\n- h1f1: Captures the bishop, but after Rxf1, Black's rook becomes more active\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- h1f1 seems tempting as it wins a bishop, but after Rxf1, Black's rook will be very active on the first rank\n- h3h4 is safer, keeping the rook defended and maintaining pressure on h6\n- The h6 pawn is weak and could be captured soon with Rf6xh6\n\nAfter careful consideration, h3h4 is the safer choice as it maintains White's active pieces while avoiding any immediate tactical threats. The rook on f6 can still capture the h6 pawn next move.\n\n```\nh3h4\n```"
