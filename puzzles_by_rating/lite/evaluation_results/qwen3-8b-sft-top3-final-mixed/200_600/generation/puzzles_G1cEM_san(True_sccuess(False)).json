If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White's king is stuck in the center (d2)\n- Black has a strong bishop on f5 eyeing the king\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active\n- White's queen on d5 is unprotected\n- Black's queen is on c6, eyeing the c5 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxd5+: Immediate queen sacrifice, but after Qxd5 Bxd5, Black's bishop is trapped\n- Qxc5: Wins a pawn but allows White to consolidate\n- Bg4: Pins the knight on c3 to the king\n- Qd6: Centralizes the queen and threatens Qd2#\n- e4: Opens the center while attacking the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be Qd6:\n- Threatens Qd2# next move\n- Covers the d5 queen\n- If White moves the king, Black can play Qd2+ winning the rook\n- If White plays Qe5, then Qxe5 Bxe5 and Black is up a pawn with a winning position\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate. Qd6 creates maximum pressure.\n\n```\nQd6\n```"
