If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active, attacking g6 and controlling key squares\n- White's rook on d7 is also very active, controlling the 7th rank\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black's rook on e8 is currently blocked by the pawn on g7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rg8: Gets the rook off the 8th rank but doesn't accomplish much\n- Rf8: Similar to Rg8\n- Rd8: Blocks the queen's diagonal to g6\n- Rxe6: Trades rook for queen, but after Rxe6 Rxe6, White's rook dominates\n- h5: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- a5/c4: Pawn moves that don't help defense\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to prevent Qxg6 which would be devastating\n- Rd8 seems most logical as it blocks the queen's diagonal to g6 while keeping the rook active\n\nAfter considering all options, Rd8 is the most solid move that addresses the immediate threat while maintaining some activity for the rook.\n\n```\nRd8\n```"
