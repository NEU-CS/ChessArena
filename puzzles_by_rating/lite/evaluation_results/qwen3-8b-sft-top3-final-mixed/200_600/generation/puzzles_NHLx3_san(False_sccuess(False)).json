When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a knight on h3 that's forking our rook on h1 and bishop on c2\n3. Black also has a knight on h6 that could potentially jump to g4 or f5\n4. Our bishop on h4 is very active but needs to be careful about being trapped\n5. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the pawn on g7 weakened\n\nKey considerations:\n- We need to deal with the knight fork on h3 immediately\n- The bishop on h4 is a powerful piece that could be used for an attack\n- We should look for ways to maintain our initiative\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. h4d8 - Bishop takes rook, but after ...Qxd8 we lose material\n2. h4e7 - Bishop takes pawn, but allows ...Nxe7 winning the bishop\n3. h4f6 - Bishop takes knight, but after ...gxf6 we lose the bishop\n4. h4g5 - Retreats bishop but doesn't solve the fork issue\n5. c2a4 - Moves bishop out of fork but loses material\n6. g1g7 - Interesting sacrifice to open up Black's king\n\nAfter careful consideration, g1g7 seems the most promising:\n- It sacrifices the rook to open Black's king position\n- After ...fxg7, we have Qxg7+ with strong attack\n- Black's king will be very exposed with our bishop on h4 and queen coming to g7\n- Even if Black finds ...Kf8, we have Qxh6+ with a strong attack\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't capitalize on our active pieces. The sacrifice leads to a strong attack against Black's exposed king.\n\n```\ng1g7\n```"
