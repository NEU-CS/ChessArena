When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's queen on d7 is eyeing our undefended bishop on e2\n4. Black has a knight on e6 that could potentially jump to g5 or f4\n5. Our king is somewhat exposed with the f1 rook hanging\n\nKey considerations:\n- We need to deal with the threat to our rook on f1\n- We should consider developing our pieces while maintaining defense\n- The bishop on f3 is a major nuisance that should be addressed\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Bxf3 - trades the bishop but leaves our rook hanging\n2. Qb4 - defends the rook and attacks the knight on e6\n3. Qa5 - defends the rook but less active\n4. Rd1 - defends the rook but blocks the d-pawn\n5. gxf3 - trades pawns but leaves rook hanging\n\nAfter careful consideration, Qb4 seems strongest because:\n- It defends the rook on f1\n- It attacks the knight on e6\n- It develops the queen to a more active square\n- It maintains control over key central squares\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either leave the rook hanging or don't address the immediate threats as effectively.\n\n```\nQb4\n```"
