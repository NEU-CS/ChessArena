When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. White's rook on e5 is very active and threatening\n5. Black's rook on e8 is tied to defending against potential back rank threats\n\nKey observations:\n- White is threatening Re8+ winning the rook\n- Black needs to address this immediate threat\n- The bishop on f5 is pinned to the king by White's rook on e5\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e8e7 - blocks the pin but allows Re7+ winning the bishop\n2. f5g6 - unpins the bishop but allows Re7+ winning the bishop\n3. g8h8 - moves the king away but allows Re8+ winning the rook\n4. f5c8 - moves the bishop but allows Re8+ winning the rook\n5. e8f8 - seems best as it blocks the pin while keeping the rook defended\n\nAfter careful consideration, e8f8 is the best move because:\n- It blocks the pin on the e-file\n- The rook remains defended by the king\n- It maintains material equality\n- It doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow immediate tactics. While e8f8 doesn't improve Black's position significantly, it's the only move that doesn't lose material immediately.\n\n```\ne8f8\n```"
