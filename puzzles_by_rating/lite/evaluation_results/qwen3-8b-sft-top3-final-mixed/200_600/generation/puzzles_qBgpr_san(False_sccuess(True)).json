When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

First, let's understand the board state based on the FEN:\n- Black's king is at e8 (castling rights: Kkq - means both kingside and queenside castling are available)\n- White has a queen at g6 (Q1 in the FEN)\n- Black has a pawn at h7 that can move to g6 (h7g6 is the only legal move listed)\n- White has a bishop at d3 and knight at f3\n- Black has a bishop at f8 and knight at e7\n\n2. The only legal move given is h7g6, which is a pawn move capturing White's queen. This is a forced move as it's the only legal option.\n\n3. Evaluating h7g6:\n- Black captures White's queen with the pawn\n- After Qxg6, Black's pawn is now at g6\n- White would likely recapture with hxg6, but this would be a pawn capture rather than a queen capture\n- However, since h7g6 is the only legal move, we must play it\n\n4. After h7g6:\n- White's queen is gone, which is a major material advantage for Black\n- Black will be up a queen for a pawn\n- The position should be winning for Black\n\nSince h7g6 is the only legal move and it gives Black a decisive material advantage, we must play it.\n\n```\nh7g6\n```"
