This is a king and pawn endgame where both sides are trying to promote their pawns.\n2. The white pawn is further advanced (h4 vs a6), but the black king is closer to the white pawn.\n3. The immediate threat is that white can push h5 next move, bringing the pawn closer to promotion.\n4. Black needs to either:\n   - Stop the white pawn from promoting, or\n   - Promote their own pawn faster\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. Kc5 - moves toward the white pawn but allows h5 next\n2. Ka5 - same issue as Kc5\n3. Kc4 - same issue\n4. Ka4 - same issue\n5. Kc3 - same issue\n6. Kb3 - same issue\n7. Ka3 - same issue\n8. a5 - pushes the pawn, but white can respond with h5\n\nThe best move appears to be a5, pushing the pawn while the king is still in position to stop the white pawn. After a5, if white plays h5, black can play Kc5 next, keeping the opposition and stopping the pawn.\n\nOther moves allow white to push h5 immediately, which would be more dangerous as the white pawn gets closer to promotion.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na5\n```"

White has a king on g5 and a pawn on h5.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack wants to promote one of their pawns (especially the a-pawn, which is more advanced), while White will try to stop that or promote their own h-pawn.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- The position is very delicate. It's a race between Black pushing the a-pawn and White trying to stop it or push their own h-pawn.\n- Black\u2019s king is already deep in White's territory, on b4.\n- Black's pawns are on a5 and b5 \u2014 both can be pushed.\n- White's king is on g5, relatively far from the action but can race toward the queenside if needed.\n- Black must advance the a-pawn as quickly as possible before White can interfere.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n- `Kc5` \u2013 King moves closer to the center, supporting the pawns.\n- `Kc4` \u2013 King steps forward, still supporting the pawns.\n- `Ka4` \u2013 King moves toward the a-pawn, possibly to support its advance.\n- `Kc3` \u2013 King advances further, aiming to support the a-pawn.\n- `Kb3` \u2013 King moves toward the queenside, supporting the a-pawn.\n- `Ka3` \u2013 King moves even closer to the a-pawn.\n- `a4` \u2013 Pushes the a-pawn forward.\n\n### Best Plan:\nThe best plan is to **push the a-pawn immediately** with `a4`. This creates a passed pawn and forces White to respond. If Black waits, White may get time to bring the king over and stop the pawn.\n\nAfter `a4`, White cannot stop the pawn without giving up the h-pawn. For example:\n- `a4` followed by `a3` and `a2` leads to promotion unless White sacrifices the h-pawn.\n\nSo, the most urgent and effective move is:\n\n```\na4\n```"
