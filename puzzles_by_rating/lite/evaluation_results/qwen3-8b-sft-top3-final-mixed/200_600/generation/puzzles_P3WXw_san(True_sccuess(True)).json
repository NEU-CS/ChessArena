When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (b4), Rook (c3), Bishop (e5), Bishop (f1), pawns (c2, g2, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (d8), Rook (d1), Bishop (a2), Knight (e4), pawns (a7, b7, f5, g7, h7)\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has two active rooks vs Black's two rooks and bishop\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White's rooks are very active, especially the one on b4 attacking the b7 pawn\n- Black's bishop on a2 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal\n- Black's knight on e4 is well placed, attacking f2 and c3\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Bf1: This would block the bishop's diagonal and prevent Black's bishop from becoming too active. However, it doesn't create any immediate threats.\n- Bxd1: This captures Black's rook, but after Rxd1, White's position remains complicated with Black's pieces still active.\n\n4. Deeper analysis:\n- After Bxd1 Rxd1, White can play Rb5 attacking the rook, but Black can defend with Rb8\n- The bishop on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares near Black's king\n- The immediate Bxd1 seems more forcing and creates concrete threats\n\n5. Best move:\nBxd1 is the more active choice, winning material and maintaining pressure. After Rxd1, White can continue with Rb5 or other active moves to maintain the initiative.\n\n```\nBxd1\n```"
