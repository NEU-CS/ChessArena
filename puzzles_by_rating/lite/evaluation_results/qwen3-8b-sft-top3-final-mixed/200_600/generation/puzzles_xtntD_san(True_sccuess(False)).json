When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- Black's rook on e2 is very active and threatening to capture the bishop on f3\n- Black's rook on d8 could potentially join the attack\n- Black's bishop on c7 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bxc6: Capturing the bishop, but after ...Rxf2 White's king is exposed\n- Bh5: Moving the bishop to safety while eyeing the f7 pawn\n- Bd5+: Checking the king, but after ...Kg8 the bishop is still under attack\n- Rxe2: Trading rooks, but after ...Bxe2 White's king remains exposed\n- Kh1: Moving the king to safety, but seems passive\n- Rf1: Blocking the e-file, but allows ...Rxf2\n\n4. Best move seems to be Bh5:\n- Gets the bishop to safety\n- Eyes the weak f7 pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Keeps options open for both defense and counterplay\n\nOther moves either leave the bishop hanging or expose the king too much. Bh5 is the most flexible and safest move.\n\n```\nBh5\n```"
