If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has rook + rook vs Black's rook + bishop. Material is equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rooks are very active on the e-file and b-file\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with weak dark squares around it\n- Black's bishop on e5 is strong, controlling important squares\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxf7: This looks tempting as it attacks the rook and threatens mate on g7, but after ...Rxf7 Rxf7 Kxf7, White loses material\n- Re7: Pins the bishop to the king, but Black can play ...Bd6 maintaining the pin\n- Rb8: Threatens to double rooks on the 8th rank, but Black can defend with ...Rb8\n- Rxe5: Wins the bishop, but after ...Rxe5 Rxe5, Black's rook becomes very active\n- Rb6: Prepares to double rooks on the b-file while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be Rb6:\n- Prepares to double rooks on the b-file (after ...axb6 Rxb6, White has two rooks on the b-file)\n- Maintains pressure on the b7 pawn\n- Keeps options open for both rooks\n- Doesn't allow Black any counterplay\n- Prepares potential sacrifices like Rb7+ in some lines\n\nOther moves either give up the initiative or allow Black counterplay. Rb6 maintains White's positional advantage while keeping all options open.\n\n```\nRb6\n```"
