When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized position with pieces active (queen on d3, knight on c3, bishop on f6)\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with pawns advanced in front\n4. White's bishop on f6 is very strong, controlling key squares and pinning the g7 pawn to the king\n5. Black's queen and rook are somewhat passive on the back rank\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the pin on g7\n- Need to activate the queen and rook\n- Need to deal with White's strong bishop on f6\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g7f6 - Capturing the bishop immediately, but after exf6 White gets strong central pawns\n2. e7f6 - Also capturing the bishop, but leaves the e-file open\n3. d8d7 - Moving the queen to a more active position while maintaining the pin\n4. c8c7 - Developing the rook and connecting rooks\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g7f6 is too weakening as it opens the e-file for White's rook\n- e7f6 is playable but still leaves structural weaknesses\n- d8d7 is solid, getting the queen active while maintaining pressure\n- c8c7 is also reasonable but doesn't address the immediate pin\n\nThe best move appears to be d8d7, activating the queen while maintaining the pin on g7. This keeps options open and doesn't create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nd8d7\n```"
