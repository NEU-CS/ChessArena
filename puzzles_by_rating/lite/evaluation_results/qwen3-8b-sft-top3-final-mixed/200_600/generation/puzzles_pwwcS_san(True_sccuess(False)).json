If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on b3 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on b3 is under attack by White's pawn\n- White's rook on c4 is very active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxb3: Capturing the pawn, but after Rxb3 Rxb3, White's rook becomes even more active\n- Rxc4: Trading rooks, but after Rxc4 Rxc4, White's knight becomes more active\n- Bxg3: Removing the pawn, but opens the h-file for White's rook\n- Rc7: Defending the b3 pawn while keeping the rook active\n- Kf8: Moving the king to safety\n\n4. Best options seem to be:\n- Rc7: Solidly defends the b3 pawn while keeping the rook active\n- Rxb3: Takes the pawn but gives White active play\n- Kf8: Improves king safety\n\nAfter considering these, Rc7 seems most principled as it:\n- Defends the b3 pawn\n- Keeps the rook active\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Maintains flexibility for future play\n\nThe other options either give White too much activity or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nRc7\n```"
