If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop (White has B vs Black's N). However, White's king is exposed and Black has some attacking chances.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is stuck in the center (e2) with limited pawn cover\n- Black has a knight on e7 that can jump to several squares\n- Black's bishop on d7 is blocked by its own pawn on b5\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7g6: Attacks the bishop on b6 and threatens to fork king and rook with ...Nf4+\n- e7c6: Blocks the c-pawn and attacks the rook on d6\n- d7e6: Develops the bishop and connects rooks\n- b5c4: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- e7g6 looks tempting as it attacks the bishop and threatens a fork, but after Bf4 White can defend\n- b5c4 is solid but gives up the pawn\n- d7e6 is passive\n- e7c6 is interesting as it blocks the pawn and attacks the rook, but White can play Rxc6\n\nAfter considering all options, e7g6 seems the most active, creating immediate threats against White's position despite the bishop being able to retreat. The knight fork threat is too dangerous for White to ignore.\n\n```\ne7g6\n```"
