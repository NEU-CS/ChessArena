Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has queen, rook, bishop, pawns\n- Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a strong centralized queen on b8.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b8 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed pawn on c5 that could become dangerous\n- Black's knight on d6 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on f4\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Nd8: Moves the knight away from the pin but leaves the queen on b8 very active\n- Nxb8: Captures the queen but loses the knight to Rxb8\n- Qd8: Moves the queen to defend while maintaining material equality\n\n4. Evaluating Qd8:\n- Gets the queen out of attack while maintaining material\n- Covers the b8 square against potential rook checks\n- Keeps options open for future play\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\n5. Other moves:\n- Nd8 allows Qxb8 winning the queen for a knight\n- Nxb8 loses material after Rxb8\n\nThe best move is to move the queen to d8, maintaining material equality while getting the queen to safety. \n\n```\nQd8\n```"
