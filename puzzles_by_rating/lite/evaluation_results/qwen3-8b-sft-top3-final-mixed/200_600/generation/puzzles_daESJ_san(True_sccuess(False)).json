When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a knight (roughly -6 points), but has some active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong queen on h5 attacking f7\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on h8 is under attack by White's queen\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Kf8: Gets the king away from potential checks but leaves Rxh5 hanging\n- Kd8: Similar to Kf8 but more exposed to future checks\n- Rxh5: Eliminates the dangerous queen but gives up the rook for it\n- Qf7: Blocks the queen's attack on f7 while developing the queen\n\n4. Evaluating Qf7:\n- Blocks the queen's attack on f7\n- Connects the rooks\n- Prepares to potentially double rooks on the h-file\n- Maintains material equality (rook for queen)\n- After Qf7, White would likely play Qxf7+ Kxf7, but then Black can play Rxh5 with a slightly better position\n\n5. Other moves:\n- Rxh5 immediately loses the exchange (rook for queen)\n- King moves leave the rook hanging and don't solve the immediate problems\n\nAfter careful consideration, Qf7 seems like the most resilient move, maintaining material balance while improving Black's piece coordination.\n\n```\nQf7\n```"
