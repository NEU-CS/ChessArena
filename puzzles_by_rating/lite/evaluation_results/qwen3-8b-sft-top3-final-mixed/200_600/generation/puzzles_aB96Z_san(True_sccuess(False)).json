When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Knight, 4 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two rooks vs queen)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b8 is very active and threatening\n- Black's queen is on a4, eyeing the b3 pawn\n- Black's knight on d3 is well placed but could be kicked by c4\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Rf8: Defends against potential rook checks on the f-file, but doesn't address other threats\n- Qe8: Centralizes the queen, defends the e6 pawn, and prepares to double rooks on the f-file\n\n4. Threats to consider:\n- White could play Rb8-b5+ next move, forcing the king to move\n- White might try to activate the rook on f1\n- The b3 pawn is weak and could be targeted\n\nAfter considering these factors, Qe8 seems more active and flexible:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- It defends the e6 pawn\n- It prepares to double rooks on the f-file with Rf7\n- It maintains flexibility for future plans\n\nRf8 would be more passive and doesn't improve Black's position as much.\n\n```\nQe8\n```"
