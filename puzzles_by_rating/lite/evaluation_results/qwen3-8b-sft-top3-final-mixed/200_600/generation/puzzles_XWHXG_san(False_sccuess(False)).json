When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and queens)\n2. Black's king is exposed in the center (e8) while White's king is castled\n3. Black has a strong bishop on h4 pinning White's g2 pawn to the king\n4. White has a knight on h8 that's very active but potentially trapped\n5. Black's queen on e7 is eyeing the f7 square\n\nKey observations:\n- The knight on h8 is under attack by Black's bishop on h4\n- Moving the knight would allow Black to play ...Bxg2 winning a pawn\n- The bishop on c4 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's queen on f3 is well placed but could be more active\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h8f7 - Knight sacrifice to open Black's king\n2. c4g8 - Bishop sacrifice to open Black's king\n3. f3f6 - Queen move attacking the pinned bishop\n4. c1h6 - Developing the bishop with tempo\n\nAfter deep consideration:\n- h8f7 looks tempting but after ...Kxf7, Black's king escapes danger\n- c4g8 is interesting but after ...Kxg8, Black's king is still exposed\n- f3f6 is strong, attacking the bishop while maintaining pressure\n- c1h6 is solid but doesn't create immediate threats\n\nThe most forcing and dangerous move is f3f6, attacking the bishop while maintaining all of White's threats. Black must respond to the attack on the bishop, and White can follow up with strong moves like Qxh4 or bringing more pieces into the attack.\n\n```\nf3f6\n```"
