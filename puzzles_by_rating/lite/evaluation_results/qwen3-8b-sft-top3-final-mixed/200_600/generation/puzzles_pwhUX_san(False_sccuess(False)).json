When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Queen, 2 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 3 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal (White might be slightly better)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's king is exposed on h7\n   - White's queen is very active on g4\n   - Black has a knight on f2 attacking White's rook on f1\n   - White's rook on f1 is pinned to the king\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - h1g1: King moves to g1, unpinning the rook\n   - f1f2: Rook moves to f2, capturing the knight\n\n4. Evaluating f1f2:\n   - Captures the knight but loses the rook to Qxf2+\n   - After Qxf2+, Kxf2 leaves White down material\n   - Not a good option\n\n5. Evaluating h1g1:\n   - King moves away from danger\n   - Rook remains pinned but it's safer now\n   - Black can't immediately exploit this\n   - Maintains material equality\n\n6. Other considerations:\n   - h1g1 is the only safe move that doesn't lose material\n   - After h1g1, White can think about activating the rook\n   - The position remains complex but White survives\n\nConclusion: h1g1 is the only move that doesn't lose material and keeps the game going.\n\n```\nh1g1\n```"
