When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key threats:\n- White's queen on f5 is very active and threatens Qxf8 winning the rook\n- White's rook on e6 is also very strong, controlling the e-file and eyeing the black king\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has potential mating threats with queen and rook coordination\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8f7: Blocking the queen's attack on the rook while keeping the rook defended\n- f8g8: Moving the rook to a safer square while keeping it active\n- h7h6: Creating some luft for the king\n- g7g6: Similar idea to h7h6\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- f8f7 seems most logical as it defends the rook from the queen while maintaining activity on the f-file\n- Other rook moves either leave it undefended or less active\n- Pawn moves don't address the immediate threat to the rook\n\nThe move f8f7 also prevents White from playing Qxf8, which would be devastating. After f8f7, White would need to find another plan, giving Black some breathing room.\n\n```\nf8f7\n```"
