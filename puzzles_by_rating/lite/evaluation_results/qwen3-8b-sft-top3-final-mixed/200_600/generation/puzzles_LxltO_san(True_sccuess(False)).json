If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black has a strong pawn center with pawns on d5 and e4, but White has some counterplay\n3. Black's queen on g6 is very active, eyeing the g2 pawn\n4. White's knight on d4 is well placed but could be kicked with ...cxd4\n5. Black has a potential discovered attack with the bishop on b7 if the knight moves\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with the h7 pawn undefended\n- White has a rook on h1 that could potentially swing to h7\n- The e4 pawn is a target that could be challenged\n- Black's queen is very active and could become dangerous if not addressed\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rxh7 - Immediately attacking the undefended pawn, but after Qxh7 we lose the rook for a pawn\n2. Qh5 - Developing the queen with threats against f7 and h7\n3. Nf5 - Centralizing the knight and attacking e7\n4. bxc5 - Challenging Black's center\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qh5 looks very strong as it develops the queen with multiple threats (f7 and h7)\n- It also prepares potential discovered attacks with the bishop\n- Black's best response would likely be ...Qf6 to defend, but then we can consider Nf5 next move\n- Other moves either don't create enough threats or allow Black to consolidate\n\nThe most forcing and active move is Qh5, putting immediate pressure on Black's position.\n\n```\nQh5\n```"
