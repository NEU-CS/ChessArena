If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

White has a strong centralized queen on d4 and rook on d3\n3. Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n4. White has potential threats against the black king due to open f-file and white's bishop on c1 pointing at f4\n5. Black's queen is somewhat exposed on c6\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the immediate threats to the king\n- Need to develop pieces and coordinate them\n- Need to deal with White's active pieces\n\nCandidate moves worth considering:\n1. Qxc2+ - This looks tempting as it forces the king to move, but after Kxc2, White has Qxd7 winning a bishop\n2. Bg5+ - Checks the king, but after Kc1, not clear what's gained\n3. Qd7 - Gets the queen to safety while connecting rooks\n4. Bd7 - Develops the bishop and protects the queen\n5. Re8 - Prepares to castle by hand\n\nAfter careful consideration, Qd7 seems best because:\n- Gets the queen to safety from potential attacks\n- Connects the rooks\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Prepares potential castling by hand later\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the positional needs as effectively.\n\n```\nQd7\n```"
