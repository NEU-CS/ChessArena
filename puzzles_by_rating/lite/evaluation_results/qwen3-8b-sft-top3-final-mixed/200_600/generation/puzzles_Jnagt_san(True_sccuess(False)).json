When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n3. White has a strong centralized queen on d4\n4. Black's knight on f6 is pinned to the queen (if it moves, Qxf6 wins the queen)\n5. Black's d5 pawn is undefended\n6. White's bishop on c4 is very active\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n- Qxd5: Wins a pawn immediately, but after ...Nxd5, Black gets some activity\n- Bxd5: Also wins a pawn, but allows ...Nxd5 with some compensation\n- Qxf6: Wins the knight, but after ...gxf6, Black gets some open lines\n- Qxa7: Wins the rook, but allows ...bxa7 and Black gets some counterplay\n- Qe5: Centralizes the queen more, but doesn't win material immediately\n\nThe most forcing and best move appears to be Qxf6, winning a piece outright:\n1. Qxf6 gxf6 (forced)\n2. Bxd5 and White is up a full rook with a winning position\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to maintain balance. Qxf6 is the most decisive.\n\n```\nQxf6\n```"
