When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a rook, pawns, and king)\n2. White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n4. White's king is still in the center (e1) which could be dangerous\n5. Black has a rook on a8 that could become active\n\nKey considerations:\n- Castling (O-O) looks tempting to get the king to safety\n- The e6 pawn push is interesting to advance the passed pawn\n- Rook moves like Rg1 or Rf1 could be useful to activate the rook\n- King moves like Kf2 or Ke2 could help centralize the king\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. O-O - Safest option, gets king to safety and connects rooks\n2. e6 - Advances passed pawn but may be premature\n3. Rg1 - Prepares to double rooks or swing to g-file\n4. Kf2 - Centralizes king but leaves e1 vulnerable\n\nAfter considering:\n- O-O is the most solid move, getting the king to safety while maintaining all options\n- e6 is tempting but Black can respond with ...f7-f6 stopping the pawn\n- Rg1 is interesting but doesn't address king safety\n- Kf2 is risky as it leaves the e1 square vulnerable to checks\n\nThe best move is to castle, getting the king to safety while keeping all other options open.\n\n```\nO-O\n```"
