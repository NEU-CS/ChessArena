When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Queen, Bishop, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White might be slightly better)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on d2, attacking the bishop on f3\n- White's queen is on a1, not very active\n- Black has a rook on e1, which is currently undefended\n- White has a passed pawn on b7 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Qxe1: Capturing the rook with the queen\n- Bg2: Moving the bishop to safety while maintaining pressure\n- Qd1: Blocking the queen's attack on the bishop\n\n4. Analysis of Qxe1:\n- Wins the exchange (queen for rook)\n- After Qxe1, Black can play Qxf3, but then Qxf3 and White is up material\n- The passed b-pawn becomes even more dangerous\n- White's king is relatively safe\n\n5. Other options:\n- Bg2 allows Black to play Qxf3 with counterplay\n- Qd1 is passive and doesn't solve the immediate threat\n\nThe best move is clearly Qxe1, winning material and maintaining the initiative. The passed b-pawn will be a major asset in the endgame.\n\n```\nQxe1\n```"
