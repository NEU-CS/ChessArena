When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black has a bishop pair advantage.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on c5 is very active, eyeing the b2 rook and g1 square\n- White's rook on g3 is active but potentially vulnerable\n- Black's bishop on c6 is controlling important diagonals\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Qxb2 winning the rook\n- Black could play ...Qg1+ forcing the king to move\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2h8: Rook lift to threaten the rook on f8, but allows ...Qxb2\n- b2b8: Protects the rook but seems passive\n- g3g6: Attacks the f6 pawn but allows ...Qxb2\n- c1c5: Queen trade, but after ...Qxc5 bxc5, Black's bishop pair remains strong\n- h2h4: Prepares to bring the king to g2, but slow\n\n5. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to protect the b2 rook while maintaining activity\n- b2b8 seems safest, protecting the rook and keeping the rook active on the 8th rank\n\nAfter considering all options, b2b8 is the most solid move, protecting the rook while maintaining some activity. Other moves either lose material or allow dangerous counterplay.\n\n```\nb2b8\n```"
