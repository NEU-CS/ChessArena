When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on b3 that could become dangerous\n- Black's rook on b2 is very active, pinning the b3 pawn to the king\n- White's rook on c4 is eyeing the c-file and could become active\n- Black's bishop on e5 is well placed, controlling important diagonals\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b3: Capturing the pawn immediately, but after Rxb3 the pin is broken\n- e5f4: Attacking the knight, but White can just move it\n- c8f8: Developing the rook to a more active position\n- e5d6: Centralizing the bishop more\n\n4. Best move seems to be b2b3:\n- It eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Rxb3, Black can play Rxb3 winning the pawn\n- It maintains the pin on the b-file\n- It opens the b-file for potential rook activity\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow White to maintain pressure. Capturing the pawn is the most forcing and concrete way to improve Black's position.\n\n```\nb2b3\n```"
