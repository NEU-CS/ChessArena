When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Knight vs Black's Rook, Bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on b2 that could become dangerous.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b1, while Black's king is more active on b4. Black's rook on g2 is very active and threatening.\n\n3. Immediate threats: Black's rook on g2 is attacking the h2 pawn. If White doesn't defend it, Black can play Rxh2 next move.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h3: Defends the h2 pawn but leaves the rook on g2 still active\n- Rc4+: Checks the king and forces it to move, but after Kb5 the rook can still take h2\n- Rxd5: Captures the bishop but allows Rxh2\n- Rc8: Prepares to defend h2 with Rc2 next move\n- Rcd3: Doubles rooks on the d-file but doesn't address the h2 threat\n\n5. Best move seems to be Rc4+:\n- Forces the black king to move (only legal reply is Kb5)\n- After Kb5, White can play Rc2 to defend h2\n- The rook on c4 also eyes the b4 pawn which is weak\n- Maintains activity for White's pieces\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or allow Black to maintain too much initiative. Rc4+ is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\nRc4+\n```"
