When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a strong centralized queen on e4 and bishop pair\n3. Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n4. White has pressure on the d5 pawn which is currently defended by Black's bishop on e6\n5. Black's queen is somewhat awkwardly placed on d8\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the threat to d5 pawn\n- Should consider king safety\n- Need to activate pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Qxd4 - trades queens but leaves Black down material after Bxd4\n2. Bxd4 - trades bishop for queen, but after Qxd4 Black's position remains passive\n3. Qe7 - connects rooks and prepares to castle\n4. Be7 - prepares to castle and defends d5\n5. e5 - challenges White's center but opens lines\n\nAfter considering these:\n- Qe7 looks solid, connecting rooks and preparing to castle\n- Be7 is also reasonable but blocks the e-pawn\n- e5 is too risky as it opens the position when Black isn't ready\n\nThe most principled move is Qe7, which:\n- Connects rooks\n- Prepares to castle\n- Maintains flexibility\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQe7\n```"
