When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's pawn is on a6, just one square from promotion. However, Black's king is on a7, directly blocking the pawn.\n2. Black's pawn on f5 is not an immediate threat as it's far from promotion.\n3. The main goal is to either promote the a-pawn or prevent Black from promoting their f-pawn.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. b5c6 - King moves towards the pawn but allows Black's king to capture it (Ka7-b6)\n2. b5c5 - Similar issue, allows Kb6\n3. b5a5 - Keeps the king near the pawn but doesn't make progress\n4. b5c4 - Moves away from the pawn, not helpful\n5. b5b4 - Also moves away from the pawn\n6. b5a4 - This seems most promising as it maintains control over the a6 pawn while preparing to support its promotion.\n\nAfter b5a4, Black has limited options:\n- If Ka7-b7, then Kb5-a5 and White can support the pawn's advance\n- If Ka7-a8, then Kb5-b6 and White can capture the pawn\n\nThe key is to keep the Black king away from the a-file while advancing our own king to support the pawn. b5a4 is the only move that maintains all these conditions.\n\n```\nb5a4\n```"
