When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawn vs Black's knight and pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White's king is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's knight on f1 is very active and threatening\n- White's bishop on h5 is strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is on e7, somewhat exposed\n- White's king is on f3, well-placed to support the pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5e8: Bishop sacrifice to remove the knight, but after ...Kxe8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- h5f7: Bishop sacrifice, but after ...Kxf7 White's king is too far to stop the pawns\n- h5g6: Attacks the f5 pawn, but Black can defend with ...Kf6\n- f3g2: King moves closer to the knight, but allows ...Nxe3\n- g5g6: Pushes the pawn, but Black can play ...fxg6 and the position remains balanced\n- a3a4: Doesn't address the immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5g6:\n- Attacks the f5 pawn which is currently undefended\n- If Black takes with ...fxg6, White can play Kxg4 winning a pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with g5-g6, creating a passed pawn\n- Maintains pressure while keeping the bishop active\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black counterplay. The bishop move h5g6 creates immediate threats while maintaining all of White's advantages.\n\n```\nh5g6\n```"
