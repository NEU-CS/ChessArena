If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on f5 attacking the d7 rook\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen on e2 is eyeing the g4 square\n- Black's bishop on d4 is very active\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Bxd7 winning the exchange\n- White could also play Qg4+ with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bxf2+ - sacrifices the bishop but opens up the king\n- Qc7 - defends the rook and connects rooks\n- Kf8 - moves the king to safety\n- Rd6 - defends the rook and attacks the bishop\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- Bxf2+ looks tempting but after Kxf2 Qg4+ wins material\n- Qc7 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- Kf8 is safe but passive\n- Rd6 is the most active, defending the rook while attacking the bishop\n\nThe best move is Rd6, as it:\n- Defends the rook on d8\n- Attacks the bishop on f5\n- Maintains piece activity\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\n```\nRd6\n```"
