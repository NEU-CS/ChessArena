When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n4. White has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n5. Black's rooks are not optimally placed (a8 and b8 are passive)\n\nKey observations:\n- White can castle kingside immediately with e1g1, bringing the king to safety and connecting rooks\n- The e5 pawn is passed but needs support to advance\n- The a1 rook could become active by moving to the 7th rank (a1a7)\n- Black's pawn structure is slightly compromised with doubled pawns on the c-file\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e1g1 (castling) - brings king safety and rook to f1\n2. a1a7 - immediately activates the rook\n3. e5e6 - advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n\nAfter considering:\n- Castling is very solid and brings the king to safety\n- a1a7 is tempting but black can respond with ...b7b5 to challenge the rook\n- e5e6 is interesting but after ...f7e6, white's pawn structure becomes less optimal\n\nThe most principled move is to castle, improving king safety and preparing to activate the rook via f1 or d1 later. This maintains all options while reducing the king's vulnerability.\n\n```\ne1g1\n```"
