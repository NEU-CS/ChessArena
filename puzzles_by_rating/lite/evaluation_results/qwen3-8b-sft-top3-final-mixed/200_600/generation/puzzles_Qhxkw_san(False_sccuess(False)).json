When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's bishop on c5 is very strong, controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- Black's rook on b7 is active but can be challenged\n- White's rook on a1 is currently passive\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: c5f8 looks tempting as it checks the king and attacks the rook\n- Rook moves: a1a7 looks interesting to challenge the rook\n- King moves: g1h1 to get off the g-file\n\n4. Evaluating c5f8+:\n- After c5f8+, Black must take with the king (Kxf8)\n- Then White can play Ra7, winning the rook on b7\n- This leads to a winning endgame with Rook vs Knight\n\n5. Other options:\n- a1a7 immediately allows Black to play Rb8 pinning the rook\n- Other bishop moves don't create immediate threats\n- King moves are too passive\n\nThe most forcing and winning line is c5f8+, leading to Ra7 and winning the rook. This is clearly the best move.\n\n```\nc5f8\n```"
