If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. White has a strong bishop on h6 pinning the f6 knight to the king\n3. White's queen on g4 is very active, eyeing the g7 pawn and potentially threatening mate on g7\n4. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n5. Black's knight on h5 is under attack by White's queen\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Qxg7# if the knight moves or is captured\n- We must address this threat while improving our position\n- The knight on h5 is pinned but can be defended by moving the queen\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qe6 - defends g7 and develops the queen, but allows Bxh5\n2. Qxf5 - trades queens but leaves us in a bad endgame\n3. Nf6 - blocks the pin but allows Qxg7#\n4. g6 - breaks the pin but allows Qxg7#\n5. Qc7 - defends g7 while developing the queen\n\nAfter careful consideration, Qc7 seems best because:\n- It defends the g7 pawn\n- Develops the queen to a more active square\n- Maintains the pin on the h6 bishop\n- Doesn't create any immediate weaknesses\n\nOther moves either allow mate or lead to worse positions. While Qe6 is tempting, it loses material after Bxh5.\n\n```\nQc7\n```"
