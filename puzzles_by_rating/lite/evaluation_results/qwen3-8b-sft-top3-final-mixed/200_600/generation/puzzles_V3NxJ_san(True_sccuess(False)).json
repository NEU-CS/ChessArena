If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on d5 is very active, attacking the pawn on e6\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White's bishop on c3 is well placed, eyeing the a5-f1 diagonal\n- Black's bishop on b8 is passive, blocked by its own pawn on a6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxb8: Wins a bishop but allows Black to play ...Rd8 with counterplay\n- Ba5: Pins the pawn on b6 to the king, creating threats\n- c6: Pushes the pawn, but may be premature\n- Rb7: Centralizes the rook and threatens to invade on the 7th rank\n\n4. Best move seems to be Ba5:\n- Pins the b6 pawn to the king\n- Threatens to win the pawn with Bxb6 if Black doesn't defend\n- Maintains pressure on the diagonal\n- Keeps all other options open\n\nOther moves like Rxb8 or Rb7 are tempting but either give up the initiative or allow Black counterplay. Ba5 maintains maximum pressure while improving our piece coordination.\n\n```\nBa5\n```"
