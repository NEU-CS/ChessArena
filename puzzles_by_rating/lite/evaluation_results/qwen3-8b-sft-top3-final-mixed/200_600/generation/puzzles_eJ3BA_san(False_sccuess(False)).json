When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. White has a strong centralized queen on d4 and rook on d3\n3. Black's king is exposed with no pawn cover\n4. White's pieces are more active and coordinated\n5. Black's queen on b6 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n\nKey observations:\n- White threatens Qxe6, winning a pawn\n- Black needs to address this threat while improving piece coordination\n- The e7 bishop is very passive and needs to be activated\n- The c8 bishop is blocked by the pawn on e6\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e7f6 - Developing the bishop and defending e6\n2. c8d7 - Developing the bishop and connecting rooks\n3. c6e8 - Moving the queen to a safer square\n4. e6e5 - Pushing the pawn to challenge white's center\n\nAfter considering these:\n- e7f6 looks most principled, developing a piece and defending e6\n- c8d7 is also reasonable but doesn't address the e6 pawn\n- c6e8 is too passive\n- e6e5 would open the position when we're behind in development\n\nThe best move is e7f6, which:\n- Develops the bishop\n- Defends the e6 pawn\n- Prepares to possibly bring the rook to e8\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\n```\ne7f6\n```"
