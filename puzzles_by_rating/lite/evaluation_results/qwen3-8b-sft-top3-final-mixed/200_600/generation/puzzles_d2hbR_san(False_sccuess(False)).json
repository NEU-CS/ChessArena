When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong centralized queen on d6 and bishop on c7 eyeing the kingside\n3. White's king is somewhat exposed after castling (rook on f1, king on g1)\n4. Black has threats like ...Qd4+ or ...Bxg2 if we're not careful\n5. Our pieces are somewhat uncoordinated - the bishop on e3 is blocked by pawns\n\nKey observations:\n- We need to address the immediate threats to our king\n- We should try to activate our pieces while limiting Black's options\n- The move d1a4 looks tempting to attack the bishop on c7, but after ...Qxa4 we lose material\n- e3h6 is interesting to pin the pawn to the king, but Black can play ...gxh6\n- c3d5 is a centralizing move that attacks the queen and opens lines\n\nAfter considering these options, c3d5 seems strongest because:\n1. It attacks the queen which must move\n2. It opens the c-file for our rook\n3. It maintains control over key central squares\n4. After Qxd5, we can play Bxg7 winning the exchange\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or allow Black to maintain pressure. The knight move also keeps our pieces active and coordinated.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
