When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The white pawn on e4 is passed and could potentially promote if not stopped.\n2. The black pawn on a6 is also passed but far from promotion.\n3. The kings are far apart - white king is on g8 while black king is on a2.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. a2b3 - moves king towards center but away from both pawns\n2. a2a3 - moves king forward but doesn't help much\n3. a2b2 - moves king towards white pawn but still far\n4. a2b1 - moves king towards corner, not helpful\n5. a2a1 - moves king to corner, very bad\n6. a6a5 - advances the pawn, creating a passed pawn that might distract white\n\nThe most promising move is a6a5 because:\n- It creates a passed pawn that white must deal with\n- It gives black a potential counterplay if white focuses on stopping it\n- The white king is too far away to stop both pawns (e4 and a5)\n- If white tries to stop the a-pawn, the e-pawn can advance\n\nOther moves just shuffle the king without creating any threats. The pawn push is the only way to create counterplay.\n\n```\na6a5\n```"
