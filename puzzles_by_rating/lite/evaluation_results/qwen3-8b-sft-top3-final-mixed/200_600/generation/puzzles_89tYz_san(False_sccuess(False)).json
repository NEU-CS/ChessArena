White has a king and two pawns (on g4 and h5), while Black has a king and a pawn on b3. The key elements to consider:\n\n- **White's king is on g6**, very active.\n- **Black's king is on d2**, trying to support its b3 pawn.\n- **White has two passed pawns**: one on g4 and one on h5.\n- **Black's pawn on b3** is a potential threat if it queens, but it's far from promotion and White's king is close enough to stop it.\n\n### Goal for White:\nPromote one of the pawns (especially the h-pawn, which is more advanced) while preventing Black from promoting their own pawn.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the list:  \n- `g6h7`, `g6g7`, `g6f7`, `g6h6`, `g6f6`, `g6g5`, `g6f5`, `h5h6`, `g4g5`\n\nWe need to find the move that best supports pawn promotion and keeps Black's king at bay.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Key Moves:\n\n#### `h5h6` \u2013 Pushing the h-pawn forward\n- This advances the most dangerous pawn.\n- It forces Black to respond immediately or risk losing.\n- After `h5h6`, Black must either:\n  - Move the king toward the h-file (`Ke3`, `Kd3`, etc.)\n  - Try to push the b3 pawn (`b2`), but White can easily stop it.\n\n#### `g6g5` \u2013 King moves to support g4-g5\n- Also good, but less urgent than pushing the h-pawn.\n- Still useful in supporting both pawns.\n\n#### `g6f6` \u2013 Centralizing the king\n- Good plan, but not as direct as pushing the h-pawn.\n\n#### `g6h7` \u2013 King goes to h7\n- Too far from the action; doesn't help promote pawns.\n\n#### `g6g7` \u2013 King to g7\n- Not particularly useful unless preparing to support h6-h7.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\nThe most forcing and effective move is **`h5h6`**. It creates an immediate threat and forces Black to react. White can then follow up with king support to promote this pawn.\n\n```\nh5h6\n```"
