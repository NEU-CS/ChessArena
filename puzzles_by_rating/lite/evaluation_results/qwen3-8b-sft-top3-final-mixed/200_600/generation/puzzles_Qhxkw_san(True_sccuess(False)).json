When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White's bishop on c5 is very strong, controlling important diagonals\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- Black's rook on b7 is active but can be challenged\n- White's rook on a1 is not yet active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Ra8: Immediately challenges Black's rook and threatens to win it\n- Bf8: Pins the knight to the king, but Black can play Nf6\n- e5: Opens the position and threatens to push e6, but Black can respond with ...Nxe5\n- Ra7: Attacks the knight, but Black can play ...Rb8 defending\n\n4. Best move seems to be Ra8:\n- Forces Black to decide whether to trade rooks or move their rook\n- If ...Rxa8, then Bf8 wins the knight (as it's pinned to the king)\n- If ...Rb8, then Bf8 is strong\n- If ...Rc7, then Bf8 is still strong\n- Maintains all of White's positional advantages\n\nOther moves like Bf8 or e5 are also reasonable, but Ra8 seems most forcing and creates immediate threats.\n\n```\nRa8\n```"
