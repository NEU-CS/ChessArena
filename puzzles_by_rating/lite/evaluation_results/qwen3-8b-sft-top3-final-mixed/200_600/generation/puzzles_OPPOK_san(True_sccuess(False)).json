If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White's rook is very active on h6\n- Black's rook is on c2, attacking White's pawn on a2\n- Black's king is on b6, somewhat exposed\n- White's bishop is on f3, controlling important diagonals\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: Rh8 looks tempting to threaten mate on h7, but Black can defend with ...Kc7\n- Rxf6 is interesting, winning a pawn but allowing ...Rxa2\n- Bishop moves: Bxc6+ is forcing, winning the bishop pair after Kxc6\n- King moves: Kh1 is safe but passive\n- Pawn moves: h4 or g4 could be considered to gain space\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- Bxc6+ is very strong because:\n  - It wins the bishop pair\n  - After Kxc6, White can play Rh8+ winning the rook\n  - Even if Black doesn't take, White gains a tempo advantage\n  - It removes Black's defender of the a2 pawn\n\n5. Other moves:\n- Rxf6 allows ...Rxa2 with counterplay\n- Rh8+ can be met with ...Kc7\n- Pawn moves don't create immediate threats\n\nThe most forcing and advantageous move is Bxc6+, winning material and maintaining the initiative.\n\n```\nBxc6\n```"
