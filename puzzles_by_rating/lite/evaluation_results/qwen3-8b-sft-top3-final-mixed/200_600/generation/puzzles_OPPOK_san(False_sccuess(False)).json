When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on h6 is very active, attacking the black king on c6\n- Black's rook on c2 is threatening to capture the b2 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- White's bishop on f3 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, threatening mate\n- f3c6: Bishop takes king - but this is illegal (king would be in check)\n- f3h5: Bishop moves to h5, attacking the f7 pawn\n- h6h7: Rook moves to h7, maintaining pressure\n\n4. Critical line:\n- h6h8 looks very strong as it threatens Rh8# next move\n- Black has no way to prevent this mate threat:\n  - If ...Kd7, then Bc6+ wins\n  - If ...Kb7, then Bc6+ wins\n  - If ...R moves, then Rh8# is still coming\n\n5. Other moves don't create immediate threats or allow Black to escape the mating net.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the forced mate in 2 is the strongest move:\n\n```\nh6h8\n```"
