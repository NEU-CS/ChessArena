When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This is a king and pawn endgame where both sides have passed pawns.\n2. White's pawn is further advanced (b4 vs h5), but Black's pawn is closer to promotion.\n3. The kings are in opposition with White's king controlling the b-file.\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b5c6 - moves towards Black's pawn but leaves b4 pawn undefended\n2. b5b6 - advances towards promotion but may be too slow\n3. b5a6 - moves away from the action\n4. b5c5 - maintains control of b4 pawn while centralizing\n5. b5a5 - moves away from the action\n6. b5c4 - moves towards Black's pawn but leaves b4 pawn\n7. b5a4 - moves away from the action\n\nBest move analysis:\n- b5c5 is the most flexible, maintaining control of the b4 pawn while centralizing the king.\n- From c5, White can:\n  - Support the b-pawn's advance if needed\n  - Move towards the h-pawn if necessary\n  - Maintain opposition against Black's king\n\nOther moves either abandon the b-pawn or move the king away from the critical area. The position is delicate and requires precise king positioning.\n\n```\nb5c5\n```"
