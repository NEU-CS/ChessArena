When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

The black pawn is further advanced (h5 vs b4), but White's pawn is closer to promotion.\n2. Black's king is well-placed to support the h-pawn's advance.\n3. White's king needs to both stop the black pawn and support its own pawn.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. Kc6 - moves towards the black pawn but allows ...h4\n2. Kb6 - same issue as Kc6\n3. Ka6 - moves away from the action, not helpful\n4. Kc5 - keeps options open but doesn't make progress\n5. Ka5 - same as Ka6\n6. Kc4 - moves towards the black pawn while keeping options to support b4\n7. Ka4 - moves away from the action\n\nThe best move appears to be Kc4 because:\n- It moves towards the black pawn (h5)\n- It maintains flexibility to go to b5 or d5 next\n- It prevents ...h4 as the king can then go to d5 to stop the pawn\n- It keeps the option to push the b-pawn later\n\nOther moves either allow the black pawn to advance or move the king away from the critical area.\n\n```\nKc4\n```"
