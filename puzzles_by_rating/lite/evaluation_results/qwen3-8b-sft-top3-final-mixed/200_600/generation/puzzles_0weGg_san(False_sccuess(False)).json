When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on a6 is very active, attacking the rook on h8 and bishop on e4\n- Black's bishop on e4 is unprotected and could be captured\n- Black's king is exposed on f8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a6e6: Queen takes bishop with check, but after ...Kf7 the queen is trapped\n- b5e8: Bishop takes rook with check, but after ...Kxe8 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- a6g6: Queen moves to g6, threatening mate on g7, but Black can defend with ...Qe7\n- b5d7: Bishop takes pawn, but this seems too slow\n- c4c5: Pushing the passed pawn, but not immediately threatening\n\n4. Best move appears to be a6e6+:\n- Forces the king to move (only legal reply is Kf7)\n- Then we can play Qxe4+ winning the bishop\n- After Kxe4, we have Bxh7+ winning the rook on h8\n- This leads to a favorable endgame with rook and bishop vs queen\n\nThe sequence would be:\n1. a6e6+ Kf7\n2. Qxe4+ Kxe4\n3. Bxh7+ Kd5\n4. Bf4+ winning the rook on a8\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na6e6\n```"
