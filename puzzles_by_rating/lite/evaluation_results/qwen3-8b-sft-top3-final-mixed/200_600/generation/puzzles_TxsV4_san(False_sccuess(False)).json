When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong knight on g4 attacking f2 and eyeing e3\n3. Black's bishop on e7 is very active, controlling the long diagonal\n4. White's knight on d4 is well-placed but could be more active\n5. Black has potential threats like ...Qd7 or ...Bxg2 if not addressed\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to deal with the knight on g4 which is a real nuisance\n- Need to activate our pieces better\n- Need to be careful about potential tactics involving the bishop pair\n\nCandidate moves worth considering:\n1. e3h6 - Bishop takes knight, but after ...Bxh6 we lose material\n2. e3g5 - Pins the knight to the queen, but black can play ...Qd7\n3. d4e6 - Knight fork attacking queen and bishop, but black can play ...fxe6\n4. c2h7 - Interesting sacrifice to open the h-file, but may not be sound\n5. f1e1 - Rook lift to potentially double on the e-file\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be e3g5, pinning the knight to the queen. While black can play ...Qd7, we can then consider moves like Qd2 or Rfd1 to defend, and we've neutralized the dangerous knight while activating our bishop.\n\n```\ne3g5\n```"
