When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Rook, Queen vs Black's Rook, Bishop, Queen. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b8 is very active, pinning the black bishop on c8 to the king\n- Black's queen on d5 is centralized but potentially exposed\n- White's queen on e3 is well placed, eyeing the f4 and g5 squares\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3a7: Queen sacrifice to win the bishop, but after ...Rxa7 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- e3h6: Threatening mate on g7, but Black can defend with ...Qg5\n- e3b6: Attacking the bishop while maintaining pressure\n- c6c7: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n- b8b7: Doubling rooks on the 7th rank, but not maximally aggressive\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3b6:\n- Attacks the bishop on c8\n- Maintains pressure on the b-file\n- Prepares potential discovered attacks if the bishop moves\n- Keeps all options open for future play\n- If Black takes the rook with ...Bxb6, then Rxb6 wins a piece\n\nOther moves either don't capitalize on White's active pieces or allow Black to consolidate. e3b6 maintains maximum pressure while improving White's position.\n\n```\ne3b6\n```"
