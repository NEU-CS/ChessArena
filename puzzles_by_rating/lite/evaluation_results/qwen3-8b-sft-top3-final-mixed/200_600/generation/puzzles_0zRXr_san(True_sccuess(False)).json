When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Rook, Queen vs Black's Rook, Rook, Bishop, Queen. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a strong rook on g3 attacking the g6 pawn\n- Black's queen on c5 is very active\n- White's queen on b2 is somewhat passive\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxg6+: Immediate sacrifice to open the king\n- Qg7+: Another immediate king hunt\n- Qb8: Pinning the rook to the king\n- Rxc5: Trading queens but leaving Black with active pieces\n\n4. Calculating Rxg6+:\n- 33. Rxg6+ fxg6 (forced)\n- 34. Qg7+ Kf8 (only move)\n- 35. Qxg6+ Ke7\n- White has won a pawn but Black's king is still exposed\n\n5. Calculating Qg7+:\n- 33. Qg7+ Kf8 (only move)\n- 34. Rxg6+ hxg6\n- 35. Qxg6+ Ke7\n- Similar to above but with queen trade\n\n6. Calculating Qb8:\n- 33. Qb8 Rxb2 (forced)\n- 34. Rxb2 Qxb2\n- 35. Qxb2 Rxb2\n- Leads to a rook endgame which is likely drawn\n\n7. Best continuation seems to be Rxg6+ as it maintains initiative and keeps Black's king exposed while winning a pawn.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\nRxg6+\n```"
