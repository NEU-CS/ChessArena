If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Black has a knight on h3 attacking our pawn on f2, but it's defended by the king\n3. Black's knight on h6 is very active and eyeing f7\n4. Our bishop on h4 is under attack by the pawn on g5\n5. Black has a passed pawn on a5 that could become dangerous\n6. Our king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Black's knight on h3 attacking f2, but it's defended\n- We have a tactical opportunity with Rxg7+ which would win the rook on f8\n- After Rxg7+ Kxg7, we could play Qd3 attacking the knight on h3 and the rook on f8\n- Alternatively, we could play Bg5 maintaining the pin on the f6 knight\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rxg7+ - wins material but allows Black to develop counterplay\n2. Bg5 - maintains pressure but doesn't create immediate threats\n3. Qd3 - develops with tempo against both the knight and rook\n\nAfter careful consideration, Rxg7+ seems strongest as it:\n- Wins a rook for a pawn\n- Opens the g-file for our rook\n- Maintains all our threats\n- Black's compensation (active pieces) isn't enough to offset the material gain\n\nThe move is:\n\n```\nRxg7+\n```"
