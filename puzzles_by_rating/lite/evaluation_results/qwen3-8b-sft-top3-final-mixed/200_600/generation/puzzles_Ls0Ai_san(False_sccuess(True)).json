When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook on e8, Rook on e1, King on g2, pawns on a2, b2\n   - Black has: King on b8, Rook on g8, pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, h6, g3, h2\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's rook on e8 is attacking Black's rook on g8\n   - Black's king is exposed and in danger\n   - White has a passed pawn on b2 that could become dangerous\n   - Black's pawn on g3 is threatening to promote\n\n3. The only legal move given is g8e8 (Rook takes Rook). Let's evaluate this:\n   - After g8e8, White would likely play Rxe8, leaving Black with:\n     - King on b8\n     - Pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, h6, g3, h2\n     - White has Rook on e1 and King on g2\n   - Black's g3 pawn is still threatening to promote\n   - White's b-pawn is also dangerous\n\n4. Alternatives:\n   - There are no other legal moves available (no other pieces can move)\n   - The king cannot move due to checks from the rook\n   - The rook must take the attacking rook\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - The only legal move is to capture the rook with our rook\n   - While this leads to a difficult endgame, it's the only option\n\nTherefore, the move must be:\n\n```\ng8e8\n```"
