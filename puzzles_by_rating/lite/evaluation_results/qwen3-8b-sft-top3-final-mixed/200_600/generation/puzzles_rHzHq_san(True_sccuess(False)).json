If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Black's king is still in the center (e8) and hasn't castled yet\n3. White has a strong knight on g6 that's very active\n4. Black's queen on c6 is defending the b7 pawn and eyeing the g2 pawn\n5. White's queen on f4 is very active and has multiple attacking options\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's king is vulnerable in the center\n- White has several ways to attack the king position\n- The knight on g6 is a monster that can deliver checkmate if properly supported\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qxf7+ - This looks tempting as it forks the king and rook, but after Kd8, White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n2. Nxh8 - Wins the rook, but gives up the strong knight\n3. Qb8+ - Forces the king to move, but doesn't lead to immediate mate\n4. Qxf7+ Kd8 Qxh8 - This sequence wins the rook but allows Black to develop with tempo\n\nThe most forcing and decisive line appears to be:\n1. Qxf7+ Kd8 (forced)\n2. Qxh8 - winning the rook and maintaining strong pressure\n\nAfter Qxh8, Black has no good way to defend:\n- If ...Qxh8, then Nxh8 and White is up a rook\n- If ...Ke7, then Qxh6+ wins the queen\n- Other moves allow White to maintain the attack\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQxf7+\n```"
