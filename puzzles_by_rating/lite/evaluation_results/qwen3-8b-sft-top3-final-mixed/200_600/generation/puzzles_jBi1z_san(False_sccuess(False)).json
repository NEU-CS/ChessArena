When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's queen on e5 is very active and threatening\n4. Black's queen on b7 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n5. White has a passed h-pawn that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's f6 knight is pinned to the king by White's queen\n- Black's rook on f8 is undefended\n- White has several ways to attack the black king\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e5f6 - capturing the pinned knight with check\n2. e5e6 - threatening mate on g6\n3. e5h5 - attacking the h7 pawn\n4. a1e1 - doubling rooks on the e-file\n\nAfter deeper analysis:\n- e5f6+ is very strong as it forces the king to move (either h7 or h8)\n- After Kxf6, White can play Qxh8 winning the rook\n- Even if Black tries Kg8 after Qf6+, White has Qxh8 with a strong attack\n- Other moves like e5e6 allow Black to defend with Qe7\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is to capture the pinned knight with check, leading to material gain and a strong attack.\n\n```\ne5f6\n```"
