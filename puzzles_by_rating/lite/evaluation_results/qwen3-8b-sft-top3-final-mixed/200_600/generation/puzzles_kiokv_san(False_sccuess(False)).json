When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has king + bishop + pawns vs White's queen + knight + pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on b5 is attacking the bishop on b7\n- White's knight on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White has potential threats like Qxb7 or Qxg5\n\n3. Black's options:\n- Bishop moves: Need to save the bishop from Qxb7. b7c6 looks interesting, attacking the knight.\n- Queen moves: Many options, but need to be careful about getting trapped.\n- Pawn moves: e4e3 looks tempting to push the passed pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b7c6: Attacks the knight, but after Nxc6 Qxc6, White's queen remains active\n- d4d8: Queen retreat, but allows Qxb7 winning the bishop\n- e4e3: Pushing the passed pawn, but White can play Qxb7 first\n- d4e3: Queen takes the pawn, but after Nxe3 Bxe3 Qxe3, White's queen is still active\n\nAfter considering these options, the best move appears to be e4e3, pushing the passed pawn and creating some counterplay. This forces White to deal with the pawn threat while also potentially opening lines for the queen.\n\n```\ne4e3\n```"
