When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Our knight on g5 is very active and threatening\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while our king is castled\n5. Black has a pawn on e5 that could become weak if we can attack it\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) Knight moves:\n- g5h7: Forking queen and rook, but black can play Qxh7\n- g5f7: Forking king and queen, but black can play Kxf7\n- g5e6: Centralizing the knight, but not immediately threatening\n\nB) Queen moves:\n- f3g4: Trading queens, but we lose our active queen\n- f3f6: Attacking e5 pawn, but black can defend with Qe7\n- f3h3: Moving away from attack, but passive\n\nC) Castling:\n- e1g1: Getting the king to safety, but we have active pieces to play\n\nD) Other moves:\n- c1f4: Developing the bishop with tempo on the queen\n- a1a7: Rook lift to attack the weak 7th rank\n\nThe most promising seems to be g5h7, sacrificing the knight to expose black's king. After:\n1. Nxh7 Qxh7\n2. Qxg4 Qxg4\n3. Rxh7 Kxh7\n\nWe reach a rook and bishop vs queen endgame where our pieces are more active and black's king is exposed. This seems better than trading queens or castling when we have the initiative.\n\n```\ng5h7\n```"
