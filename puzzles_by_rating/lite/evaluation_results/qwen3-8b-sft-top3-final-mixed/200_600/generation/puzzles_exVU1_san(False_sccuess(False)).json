The white knight is controlling the b4 and f4 squares, which are important for the black king's movement.\n2. The black pawn on d5 is passed but currently blocked by the white knight.\n3. The white king is somewhat far away from the action.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. c4b5 - King moves towards the pawn but allows white to play Nf4+ winning the pawn\n2. c4d4 - King moves towards the pawn but allows Nf4+ winning the pawn\n3. c4d3 - King captures the knight! This seems very promising\n4. c4c3 - King moves away from the pawn, not helpful\n5. c4b3 - King moves away from the pawn, not helpful\n6. d5d4 - Pawn advances, but white can simply capture with the knight\n\nThe best move is clearly c4d3, capturing the knight. After this:\n- Black will have a passed pawn on d5\n- White's king is too far away to stop it\n- Black can promote the pawn with king support\n\nOther moves either lose the pawn immediately or don't make progress. Capturing the knight is the most forcing and decisive move.\n\n```\nc4d3\n```"

White has a king on g2 and a pawn on b5.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack to move. The goal is to win or at least not lose. Let's evaluate the position.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **White's pawn** is on b5, advanced but isolated.\n- **Black's pawn** is on d5, also advanced.\n- **Black's king** is on d3, central and active.\n- **White's king** is on g2, far from the action.\n\nThe key here is whether Black can promote the d-pawn or stop White's b-pawn from promoting.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the legal moves for Black:\n\n### Legal Moves:\n- `d3e4`, `d3d4`, `d3c4`, `d3e3`, `d3c3`, `d3e2`, `d3d2`, `d3c2`, `d5d4`\n\nWe must choose the best move.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move Analysis:\n\n#### 1. `d5d4` \u2013 Pushing the pawn forward\n- This advances the pawn toward promotion.\n- It opens up space for the black king to support it.\n- White cannot immediately capture with the king because of stalemate risks if not careful.\n- This seems like the most logical and aggressive move.\n\n#### 2. King moves (`d3e4`, `d3d4`, etc.)\n- These are slower and give White more time to advance the b-pawn.\n- Black should aim to push the d-pawn while the king supports it.\n\n---\n\n### Plan:\nBlack should push the d-pawn to d4, then continue supporting its advance with the king. The idea is to create a passed pawn and promote before White can do the same with the b-pawn.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n```\nd5d4\n```"

Black has a king and a pawn on d4, while White has a king and a pawn on b6. The key elements to consider:\n\n- **White's pawn on b6** is advanced and could potentially promote if not stopped.\n- **Black's king is on d3**, and it needs to either stop the b-pawn or support its own d-pawn.\n- **Black's d4 pawn** is currently blocked by White's king (which is on g2).\n- Black must act quickly to prevent White from promoting the b-pawn.\n\n### Legal moves for Black:\n- `d3e4`, `d3c4`, `d3e3`, `d3c3`, `d3e2`, `d3d2`, `d3c2`\n\nWe need to find the best move that either:\n- Stops White's b-pawn from promoting, or\n- Advances Black's own d-pawn toward promotion.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `d3e4`\n- King moves toward the center.\n- Not directly helping to stop the b-pawn.\n- May allow White to push b7 and promote.\n\n#### 2. `d3c4`\n- King moves closer to the b6 pawn.\n- This is promising \u2014 it threatens to capture the b6 pawn.\n- If Black can take on b6, then White has no pawns left and cannot promote.\n\n#### 3. `d3e3`\n- King moves up one square.\n- Doesn't help much in stopping the b-pawn.\n- Too passive.\n\n#### 4. `d3c3`\n- King moves left, closer to the b6 pawn.\n- Also good \u2014 supports potential capture of b6.\n- Slightly less aggressive than `d3c4`.\n\n#### 5. `d3e2`\n- King moves down.\n- Away from the action.\n- Not useful.\n\n#### 6. `d3d2`\n- King moves down.\n- Away from the critical area.\n- Not useful.\n\n#### 7. `d3c2`\n- King moves diagonally down-left.\n- Too far from the action.\n- Not useful.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move Analysis:\n\nThe most immediate threat is **White's b6 pawn**. If Black can capture it, White has no chance to promote and will likely lose.\n\nBetween `d3c4` and `d3c3`, both bring the king closer to b6. However, **`d3c4`** is more direct and puts the king in a better position to threaten the b6 pawn.\n\nIf Black plays `d3c4`, the next move could be `Kxb6`, winning the pawn and securing a win for Black.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\nd3c4\n```"
