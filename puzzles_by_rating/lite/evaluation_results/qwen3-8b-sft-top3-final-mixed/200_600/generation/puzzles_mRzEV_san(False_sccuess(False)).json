When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's queen on b4 is very active and threatening\n4. Our king is somewhat exposed with the f3 bishop eyeing it\n5. We have a passed pawn on e5 that could be dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Black's queen on b4 attacking our rook on a1\n- We need to deal with this threat while maintaining our initiative\n- Our bishop on a4 is very active and could be used to create threats\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. a4e8 - Bishop sacrifice to win the queen, but after ...Kxe8 we're down material\n2. a4b3 - Blocking the queen's attack on the rook while developing the bishop\n3. d1d4 - Moving the queen to defend the rook and potentially attack the bishop\n4. e1e4 - Moving the king to safety while connecting rooks\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- a4b3 seems most prudent, blocking the queen's attack while keeping the bishop active\n- It maintains material equality and keeps the initiative\n- Other moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\na4b3\n```"
