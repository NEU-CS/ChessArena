If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g5\n- White's rook is very active on b5\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4 that could become dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on g3 that's blocked by Black's pawn on f5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxf5+: This wins a pawn but allows Black's king to escape to h5\n- Rook moves along the b-file: Rb8, Rb7, Rb6 all seem to maintain pressure\n- King moves: Kh3 or Kh2 to bring the king closer to the action\n- g4: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn\n\n4. Best options:\n- Rxf5+ is tempting but after ...Kxf5, White's king is too far to stop Black's e-pawn\n- Rb8 is safe but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Rb6 looks strong, attacking the e6 pawn and keeping options open\n- g4 is interesting to create a passed pawn, but Black can respond with ...fxg4\n\nAfter considering these, Rb6 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the e6 pawn\n- Maintains control of the b-file\n- Keeps options to swing the rook to either side\n- Doesn't allow Black any counterplay\n\nThe move Rb6 also prevents Black from playing ...e3 in some lines, as the rook would control that square.\n\n```\nRb6\n```"
