When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Knight, Bishop vs Black's Rook, Bishop, Rook. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b6 is very active, attacking the b7 pawn which is only defended by the king.\n- Black has a rook on c4 that's pinning the knight on e4 to the king.\n- Black's bishop on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares.\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxb7+: Wins a pawn but allows Black to play Rc1+ with counterplay\n- Rxe6: Wins the bishop but allows Black to play Rc1+ as well\n- Rbd6: Defends the knight and attacks the bishop, but allows Black to play Rc1+\n- Nf6: Forking king and rook, but Black can play Kxf6\n- Bh6: Threatening mate on h7, but Black can defend with g6\n\n4. Best move seems to be Rxb7! because:\n- It wins a pawn immediately\n- After Rxb7, if Black plays Rc1+ White can respond with Kh2 and the position remains safe\n- The knight on e4 is still defended by the rook on d6\n- It maintains White's active piece play\n\nOther moves either allow Black counterplay or don't make progress. Rxb7 is the most forcing and concrete gain.\n\n```\nRxb7\n```"
