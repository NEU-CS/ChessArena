When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White's king is castled but the position is somewhat open\n4. Black has threats like ...Qd2+ or ...Bxh6\n5. White's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's queen and bishop are very active\n- White needs to address the threats while improving piece coordination\n- The f3 pawn is hanging (can be taken by Qxf3)\n- Bxh6 looks tempting but after ...Qxh6, Black's queen becomes even more active\n- Qxf3 seems dangerous as it opens the position for Black's pieces\n\nBest options:\n1. Bxh6 - but after ...Qxh6, Black's queen is too active\n2. Qxf3 - too risky as it opens the position\n3. Bg5 - pins the knight and develops a piece\n4. d5 - challenges Black's center but may open lines\n5. Re1 - prepares to double rooks or defend e2\n\nAfter considering these, Bg5 seems most principled:\n- Pins the knight on e7\n- Develops a piece\n- Maintains control over h6\n- Doesn't open any lines for Black's pieces\n- Prepares potential Bf4 or Bh6 later\n\nThe alternatives either risk too much or don't improve White's position. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nBg5\n```"
