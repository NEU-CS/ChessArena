When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance and piece placement:\n- Black has a rook on a8, knight on c6, queen on f6, bishop on e6, pawns on a7,b7,c7,e5,f4,h4\n- White has a rook on g2, knight on e5, queen on h5, bishop on b2, pawns on a4,b4,c3,d4,f3,h3\n- Black's king is on e8, White's king is on b1\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- White has a knight on e5 that's very strong\n- Black's bishop on e6 is pinned to the king by White's rook on g2\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n- e8f8: King moves to f8 - but this walks into potential checks from White's queen\n- e8d8: King moves to d8 - still exposed and doesn't solve any problems\n- h8h5: Rook takes queen - but after Rxh5, White can play Nxf7+ winning the bishop\n- e6f7: Bishop takes knight - this seems most promising as it removes the strong knight\n\n4. Evaluating e6f7:\n- After Bxf7, White can play Qxf7+ Kd8\n- Then White has Qxh5 winning the queen, but Black can recapture with Rxh5\n- Material would be roughly equal (Black loses bishop and queen, gains rook and knight)\n- However, Black's king remains exposed\n\n5. Other options are worse:\n- Moving the king just delays the inevitable as White can keep attacking\n- Taking the queen leads to immediate material loss\n\nThe best practical chance is to eliminate the strong knight with the bishop, even if it leads to further complications. The other moves either lose material immediately or leave the king in danger.\n\n```\ne6f7\n```"
