When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong centralized queen on d6 and active pieces\n3. White's bishop on h4 is under attack by Black's knight on f6\n4. White's king is somewhat exposed with the f2 pawn undefended\n5. Black has potential threats like ...Qd4 or ...Nxe4\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to deal with the threat to the h4 bishop\n- Need to address the king safety concerns\n- Need to maintain control of the center\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. h4f6 - trading bishop for knight, but leaves us down a piece after ...Qxf6\n2. h4g5 - retreating bishop, but allows Black to play ...Qd4 with strong pressure\n3. e2h5 - developing the bishop with tempo, attacking the queen\n4. d2e4 - centralizing the knight and defending h5\n5. g1h1 - moving the king to safety\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e2h5 looks very strong as it develops a piece with tempo, attacking the queen while also protecting the h4 bishop\n- After ...Qxh5, we can play Bxh5 and our position remains solid\n- Other moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats\n\nThe best move is:\n```\ne2h5\n```"
