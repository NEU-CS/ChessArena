If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on e5 controlling important squares\n- White's queen on g3 is very active, eyeing the g7 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- Black's knight on d5 is well placed but could be challenged\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg7# if not addressed\n- White's bishop is very strong on e5\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Kh8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- Qf7: Blocks the g-file and defends g7\n- Ne7: Moves the knight to safety while maintaining control\n- Nf6: Attacks the bishop but allows Qxg7#\n\nAfter considering these options, Qf7 seems most prudent as it:\n- Defends against the immediate mate threat on g7\n- Maintains control of the position\n- Keeps the queen active\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either allow mate or create new problems. For example, moving the knight would leave the g7 pawn undefended.\n\n```\nQf7\n```"
