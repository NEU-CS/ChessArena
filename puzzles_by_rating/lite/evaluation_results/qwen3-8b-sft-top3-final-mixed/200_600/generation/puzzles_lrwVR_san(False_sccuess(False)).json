When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is exposed on g1 with limited pawn cover\n4. Black's rook on e5 is very active and threatening\n5. White's rooks are not optimally placed - the a1 rook is inactive\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's e5 rook is very dangerous and needs to be challenged\n- White's king safety is a concern\n- We need to activate our rooks while dealing with the immediate threats\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e1e5 - trading rooks would relieve pressure but leave us with a passive position\n2. e1e4 - challenging the e5 rook directly\n3. g1h2 - improving king safety\n4. a1d1 - activating the inactive rook\n\nAfter considering:\n- e1e4 looks most principled as it challenges Black's active rook\n- After e1e4, if Black takes (exd4), we can recapture with the a-pawn (c3xd4) activating our rook\n- If Black doesn't take, we maintain pressure on the e-file\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or worsen our position\n\nThe best move is:\n```\ne1e4\n```"
