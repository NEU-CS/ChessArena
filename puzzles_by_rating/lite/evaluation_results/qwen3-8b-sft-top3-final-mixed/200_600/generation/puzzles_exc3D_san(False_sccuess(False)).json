When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is a potential weakness\n3. White has a strong knight on g5 that's very active\n4. Black's queen on c7 is somewhat exposed\n5. White's bishop on d4 is very powerful, controlling key diagonals\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) Knight moves:\n- g5h7: Forking queen and rook, but black can play Qxh7\n- g5f7: Forking king and queen, but black can play Kxf7\n- g5e6: Interesting, attacking the bishop on e7\n- g5e4: Centralizing the knight\n\nB) Bishop moves:\n- d4a7: Attacking the rook, but black can defend with Qxa7\n- d4b6: Pinning the pawn to the queen\n- d4c5: Centralizing the bishop\n\nC) Queen moves:\n- f3d5: Centralizing the queen with threats\n- f3e4: Protecting the knight on g5\n\nD) Rook moves:\n- h1h3: Preparing to double rooks on the h-file\n\nAfter considering these options, the most promising seems to be g5e6, attacking the bishop on e7. This forces black to deal with the threat:\n- If Bxe6, then Qxe6+ wins the bishop\n- If black moves the bishop, we can consider Qd5+ next move with strong pressure\n\nOther moves like g5h7 or g5f7 are tempting but don't lead to immediate material gain. The knight on e6 would be extremely powerful, controlling key squares and putting pressure on black's position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5e6\n```"
