When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's rook and knight. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on h6 is very strong, attacking the rook on g7 and threatening to capture the knight on f8.\n- Black's queen on g6 is unprotected and could be a target.\n- White's queen on b5 is very active, eyeing the e8 square and potentially threatening mate ideas.\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6f8: Capturing the knight with check, but after ...Kxf8 White doesn't have an immediate follow-up.\n- f5g7: Capturing the rook, but after ...Qxg7 White's attack fizzles out.\n- b5e8: Threatening mate, but Black can defend with ...Rxe8.\n- f5h4: Interesting knight move threatening Qxh4, but not immediately decisive.\n\n4. The most promising line appears to be:\n- b5e8! threatening Qxe8# (mate)\n- Black must defend with ...Rxe8\n- Then h6f8+ Kxf8\n- Now f5g7+ wins the rook with check (Kxg7 Qxg6+ wins the queen)\n\nThis leads to a winning material advantage for White. The immediate b5e8 is the most forcing and decisive move.\n\n```\nb5e8\n```"
