When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's knight on d1 is very dangerous, threatening to fork king and rook with ...Nc3+\n- White's king is exposed but currently safe\n- Black's pawn on e4 is passed but blockaded by White's e3 pawn\n- White's g3 pawn is under attack by Black's f5 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: Need to keep the rook active while preventing knight forks\n- King moves: Need to stay safe from ...Nc3+ while maintaining control\n- Pawn moves: g3g4 would defend the pawn but weaken the kingside\n\n4. Best options:\n- b5b7: Moves rook to 7th rank, threatening to check on b1 and keeping pressure\n- g2h3: Moves king away from potential knight forks\n- b5f5: Captures the dangerous f5 pawn\n\nAfter considering:\n- b5f5 is tempting but after ...exf5, Black's e-pawn becomes dangerous\n- g2h3 is safe but passive\n- b5b7 is most active, keeping the rook's power while preventing ...Nc3+\n\nThe best move is to activate the rook while maintaining control:\n\n```\nb5b7\n```"
