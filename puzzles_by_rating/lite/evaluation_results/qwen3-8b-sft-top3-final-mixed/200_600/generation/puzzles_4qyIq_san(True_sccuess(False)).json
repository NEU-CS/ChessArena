Let's look at the line:\n\n1. `Qxf3 Rxf3 Rxf3`\n   - Now Black has a rook on an open file, and White's king is exposed.\n   - Black can follow up with `Rf8` or `Rf5`, putting pressure on the f-file.\n   - White's bishop on d4 is still strong, but Black gains tempo and initiative.\n\nThis move gives Black the best practical chances to press for an advantage.\n\n---\n\n```\nQxf3\n```"
