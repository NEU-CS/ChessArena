When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on a7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank\n- Black's king is exposed on b1\n- White's king is more active on c3\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on f7\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Ra1+ next move, forcing the black king to move\n- White might try to push pawns on the kingside (g4-g5 etc.)\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e6c8: Blocks the rook's path to a1, but leaves bishop passive\n- e6d7: Similar to c8, still blocks rook\n- e6f5: More active, but allows Ra1+ next\n- b1c1: Gets king away from potential checks, but still allows Ra1+\n- f7f5: Opens bishop's diagonal and creates luft for king\n\nAfter considering these, f7f5 seems most promising because:\n- It activates the bishop\n- Creates an escape square for the king (f5)\n- Prevents Ra1+ by opening the f-file\n- Maintains pawn structure\n\nOther moves either don't address the king safety or leave the bishop passive.\n\n```\nf7f5\n```"
