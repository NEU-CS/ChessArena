If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on b5, attacking b7 pawn and eyeing the king\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous\n- White's knight on e5 is well placed but could be challenged\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxb7 winning a pawn\n- White could also play Qg5+ with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxe5: Capturing the knight, but after Qxe5 Qxe5 Bxe5, White is up material\n- Qd6: Blocking the queen's attack on b7 while keeping pressure\n- Qd5: Centralizing the queen and defending e5\n- h6: Creating luft for the king\n\nAfter considering these options, Qd5 seems most promising because:\n- It defends the e5 pawn\n- It centralizes the queen\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n- It prevents Qxb7 by controlling b5\n- It keeps options open for both defense and counterplay\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats as effectively.\n\n```\nQd5\n```"
