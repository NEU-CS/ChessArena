When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a pawn (roughly -8 points), but has some compensation with active pieces and threats.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on d6 that could promote soon\n- Black's king is exposed and under pressure\n- White's bishop on b6 is very active, pinning the knight on e7\n- Black's knight on e7 is pinned and could be lost\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7g6: Moves the knight away from the pin but leaves it passive\n- e7c6: Blocks the d-pawn but allows Bxc6\n- d7e6: Blocks the d-pawn with the bishop, but allows Bxe6\n- b5c4: Captures the pawn but opens lines for White's pieces\n- h8h7: Gets the rook off the vulnerable h-file\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\nThe most urgent threat is the d-pawn. We need to stop it while maintaining our piece activity. The move d7e6 seems most principled as it:\n- Blocks the d-pawn\n- Maintains the bishop's activity\n- Doesn't immediately lose material\n- Keeps options to activate the rook later\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the main threat. While e6 is a bad square for the bishop, it's better than alternatives that lose more material.\n\nAfter d7e6, if Bxe6, we can recapture with fxe6, maintaining some piece coordination.\n\n```\nd7e6\n```"
