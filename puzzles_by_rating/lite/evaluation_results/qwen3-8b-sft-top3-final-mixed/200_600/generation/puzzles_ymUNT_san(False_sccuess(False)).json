When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized position with bishop pair and active pieces\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the f6 knight blocking the g8 square\n4. White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 pawn and could potentially create threats\n5. Black's rook on f8 is not very active\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the king safety issue\n- Want to activate the rook\n- Need to deal with White's active pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g8h8 - Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n2. f8e8 - Centralizes the rook but doesn't solve king safety\n3. f6h7 - Moves the knight to defend g5 and potentially reposition\n4. d8e7 - Connects rooks and defends e5 square\n\nAfter considering these, f6h7 seems most promising because:\n- It develops the knight to a more active square\n- It defends the g5 square from potential queen checks\n- It maintains flexibility for future piece movement\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the king safety or are too passive. The knight move also keeps options open for future tactics.\n\n```\nf6h7\n```"
