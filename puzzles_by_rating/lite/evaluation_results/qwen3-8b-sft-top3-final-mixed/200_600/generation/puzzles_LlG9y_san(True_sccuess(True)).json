When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, R, B, 4 pawns\n- Black has: Q, R, R, B, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs pawn)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on e1, attacking White's rook on d1\n- White's queen on b6 is very active, eyeing the b7 pawn and potentially the f2 square\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Rxe1: Capturing the queen, but after Rxe1 Qxe1+, White's king is in trouble\n- Qxb7: Winning a pawn but allowing Qxe1 with complications\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threat to the rook\n\n4. Best option:\nRxe1 is forced to eliminate the dangerous queen, despite the resulting checks. After:\n- Rxe1 Qxe1+\n- Bxe1 and White's position remains playable with the bishop pair and active pieces.\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow Black to maintain strong pressure. While Rxe1 leads to some complications, it's the only move that eliminates Black's most dangerous piece.\n\n```\nRxe1\n```"
