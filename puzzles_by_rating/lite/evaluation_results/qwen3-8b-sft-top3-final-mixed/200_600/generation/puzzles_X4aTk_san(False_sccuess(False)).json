When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on d5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's bishop on h4 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Black's rook on a2 is active but could be trapped\n- White's rook on b1 is defending the b-file\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rb1xa2 next move if we don't address it\n- White's knight could jump to f6 or e7 with threats\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h4d8: Bishop takes knight, but after Rxd8 we lose material\n- h4e7: Bishop retreat, but allows Rxa2\n- a2a1: Rook retreat, but passive\n- h4g5: Bishop moves to safety while maintaining pressure\n- g8h8: King moves to safety\n\nAfter considering these, the best move appears to be h4g5, which:\n- Gets the bishop to safety\n- Maintains pressure on f4 and e3 squares\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics\n- Keeps options open for both pieces\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow White to gain the initiative.\n\n```\nh4g5\n```"
