When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong rook on c4 and knight on d3 controlling important squares\n- Black's rook on b2 is active but potentially vulnerable\n- Black's bishop on e5 is well placed but could be challenged\n- White's king is exposed on f3\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rc5+ next move, attacking the bishop and rook\n- White might try to push pawns on the kingside (h4, g4 etc.)\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Bishop moves: e5f6 looks interesting, attacking the knight and opening the g-file\n- Rook moves: b2b3 defends the bishop but blocks the pawn\n- King moves: g8h8 gets the king to safety\n\nAfter considering these options, e5f6 seems most promising because:\n- It attacks the knight on d3\n- If White takes with Nxf6, Black can recapture with gxf6, opening the g-file for the rook\n- It maintains the bishop's activity\n- It doesn't allow White any immediate tactical shots\n\nOther moves like b2b3 would be too passive, and king moves don't address the positional issues.\n\n```\ne5f6\n```"
