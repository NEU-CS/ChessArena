When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized position with pieces active (Nf5, Bh5, Qd3)\n3. Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n4. White has pressure on the e5 pawn which is currently defended by Black's knight on g6\n5. Black's bishop on c5 is very active, eyeing the f2 pawn\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the threat to e5 pawn\n- Should consider castling to safety\n- Need to deal with White's active pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g6e5 - Capturing the pawn immediately, but after dxe5 White gets strong central control\n2. f7f6 - Defends e5 but weakens the king's position\n3. g8g7 - Prepares to castle by moving the king\n4. c5e3 - Interesting sacrifice to open lines, but likely too risky\n\nAfter careful consideration, g8g7 seems most prudent:\n- Prepares to castle next move\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Maintains flexibility\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either concede too much space or create new problems. Castling is the most solid choice here.\n\n```\ng8g7\n```"
