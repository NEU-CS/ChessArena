When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n4. Black has pressure on the e4 square with both the knight and pawn\n5. White's knight on b3 is under attack by the e4 knight\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to deal with the threat to the b3 knight\n- Need to address the strong e4 knight\n- Need to develop the bishop (currently blocked by pawns)\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Nc5 - attacks the e4 knight but allows Nxc5\n2. Na5 - retreats but doesn't solve the e4 knight issue\n3. Nd4 - blocks the e4 knight but allows Nxd4\n4. Rxe4 - trades rooks but gives up the open e-file\n5. Bh6 - develops bishop but doesn't address immediate threats\n6. f3 - challenges the e4 knight directly\n\nAfter considering these, f3 seems most principled:\n- Directly challenges the strong e4 knight\n- If Nxf3, gxf3 opens the g-file but weakens Black's king\n- If Nxf3, Qxf3 is possible but Black's king remains exposed\n- If Nxc3, bxc3 maintains material equality\n\nOther moves either allow Black to maintain the strong e4 knight or don't address the immediate threats.\n\n```\nf3\n```"
