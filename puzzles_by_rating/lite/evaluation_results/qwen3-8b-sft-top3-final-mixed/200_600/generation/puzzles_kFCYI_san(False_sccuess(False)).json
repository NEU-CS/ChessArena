When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a strong passed pawn on d5\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's rook on c4 is very active\n- White's rook on b2 is under attack by Black's bishop on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b8: Rook lift to attack the rook on c8, but Black can defend with ...Rc7\n- e3h6: Bishop sacrifice to open the h-file, but not immediately threatening\n- b2b7: Rook moves to 7th rank, but Black can play ...Rc7 pinning it\n- b2e2: Rook moves to e-file where it's more active\n- g1h1: King moves to safer square\n\n4. Best move seems to be b2e2:\n- Gets the rook off the attacked b-file\n- Places it on a more active e-file\n- Prepares potential rook lifts to e7 or e6\n- Doesn't allow any immediate counterplay\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or allow Black counterplay. The rook on e2 will be very active in the center.\n\n```\nb2e2\n```"
