When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal, but White has a passed e6 pawn that's very dangerous.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's e6 pawn is one square from queening\n- White's rook on d1 is very active and can support the pawn\n- Black's king is exposed and could be vulnerable to checks\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8e7: Blocking the pawn with the rook, but after Rxe7 Kxe7, White's rook dominates\n- e8e6: Capturing the pawn immediately, but after Rxe6 Kxe6, White's rook is too active\n- h8g8: Moving the king away from potential checks\n- e8f8: Moving the rook to a safer square while keeping an eye on the e-file\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\nWe need to prevent the e-pawn from queening while keeping our rook active. The most flexible move is e8f8, which:\n- Keeps the rook on the e-file to potentially stop the pawn later\n- Gets the rook off the 8th rank where it could be trapped\n- Maintains options for both rook and king movement\n\nOther moves either allow the pawn to advance or leave our rook in a vulnerable position.\n\n```\ne8f8\n```"
