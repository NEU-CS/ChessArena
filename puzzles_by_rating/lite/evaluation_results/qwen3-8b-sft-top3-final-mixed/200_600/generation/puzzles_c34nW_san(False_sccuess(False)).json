When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on c4 supported by the knight on b5\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White's queen on f3 is very active\n- Black's rook on c7 is under attack by White's rook on d6\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rd6xc6 winning the bishop\n- White could also play Qf3-f7+ winning the f7 pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7c8: Moving the rook to safety while keeping pressure on the c-file\n- c6d7: Blocking the rook's attack with the bishop\n- c6b7: Moving the bishop to safety\n- f7f6: Pushing the pawn to block potential queen checks\n\nAfter considering these options, c7c8 seems most prudent because:\n- It saves the rook from immediate capture\n- It maintains control of the c-file\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Other moves either lose material or create bigger problems\n\nThe other options have drawbacks:\n- c6d7 blocks the rook but leaves the bishop hanging to Qxd7\n- c6b7 leaves the rook still hanging\n- f7f6 is too passive and doesn't address the immediate threat\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc7c8\n```"
