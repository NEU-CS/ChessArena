When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a strong pawn center with d4 and e4 pawns\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. White's pieces are more active - the bishop on a3 is eyeing the h8 square\n5. Black's queen is under attack from the bishop on a3 (Qxa3 would win material)\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the threat to the queen\n- Need to improve king safety\n- Need to activate Black's pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Qxh4 - wins a pawn but leaves the queen exposed on h4\n2. Qd8 - retreats the queen but seems passive\n3. Qe7 - defends the queen while keeping it active\n4. Kh8 - moves the king to safety but seems too passive\n5. Rf8 - brings the rook to a more active position\n\nAfter considering these options, Qe7 seems most principled:\n- Defends the queen from the bishop\n- Keeps the queen active in the center\n- Prepares potential ...Qd6 to challenge White's center\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either leave the queen vulnerable or are too passive.\n\n```\nQe7\n```"
