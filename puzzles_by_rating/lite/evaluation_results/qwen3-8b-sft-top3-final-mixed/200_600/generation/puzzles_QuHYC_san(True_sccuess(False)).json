When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on a6. White's king is relatively safe on h1.\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - Black's rook on e8 is very active\n   - White's rook on b3 is well placed to attack the black king\n   - The pawn on f4 is passed and could become dangerous\n   - Black's king has very limited squares\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - Rb6+ - immediate check that forces the black king to move\n   - Rc6+ - similar idea but with the other rook\n   - f5 - advancing the passed pawn\n   - Bh8 - developing the bishop with threats\n\n5. Best continuation seems to be Rb6+:\n   - Forces Ka5 (only legal move)\n   - Then we can play Rc6+ next, driving the king further\n   - After Ka4, we can bring our rook to b4 with strong threats\n   - The black king is very restricted and we can gradually improve our position\n\nOther moves like f5 or Bh8 are good but don't immediately press the advantage as effectively as the rook checks.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nRb6+\n```"
