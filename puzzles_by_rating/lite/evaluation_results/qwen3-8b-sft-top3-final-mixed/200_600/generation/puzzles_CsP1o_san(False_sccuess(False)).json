When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's knight on b3 is under attack by Black's pawn on e4\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n5. Black has potential threats with their rook on h8 and bishop on f8\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to deal with the threat to the knight on b3\n- Should consider activating White's pieces\n- Need to be careful about Black's potential tactics involving the e4 knight\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. b3c5 - Attacks the e4 knight but allows ...Nxc5\n2. b3d4 - Centralizes the knight but leaves it hanging to ...Nxd4\n3. b3a5 - Retreats the knight but seems passive\n4. e1e4 - Captures the knight but allows ...Bxe4 with complications\n5. c1h6 - Develops the bishop with tempo on the rook\n\nAfter considering these, c1h6 seems most promising because:\n- Develops a piece\n- Attacks the rook on h8\n- If ...Rxh6, then Nxh6 and White has compensation\n- If ...g6, then Bxg7 Kxg7 and White has some initiative\n- Maintains control over e4 square\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve White's position as effectively.\n\n```\nc1h6\n```"
