When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

This is a king and pawn endgame where both sides are trying to promote their pawns.\n2. The white pawn is further advanced (h4 vs a6), but the black king is closer to the white pawn.\n3. The immediate threat is that white can push h4-h5, creating a passed pawn.\n4. Black needs to either:\n   - Stop the white pawn from advancing\n   - Create counterplay with the a-pawn\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. b4c5 - moves towards the white pawn, but allows h5\n2. b4a5 - moves away from the action, not helpful\n3. b4c4 - keeps pressure on h4 but still allows h5\n4. b4a4 - same as a5, not helpful\n5. b4c3 - gets closer to h4, but still allows h5\n6. b4b3 - same as above\n7. b4a3 - moves away\n8. a6a5 - advances the pawn, but white can respond with h5\n\nThe best move appears to be b4c5, as it:\n- Gets the king closer to the white pawn\n- Prepares to intercept the h-pawn\n- Maintains flexibility\n\nAfter b4c5, if white plays h5, black can respond with c5d5, continuing to approach the pawn.\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or move the king away from the critical area.\n\n```\nb4c5\n```"
