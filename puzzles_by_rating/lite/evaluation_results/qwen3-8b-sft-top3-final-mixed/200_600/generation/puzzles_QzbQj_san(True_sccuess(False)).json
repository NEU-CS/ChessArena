If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

White has a strong bishop on f6 that's pinning the g7 pawn to the king\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. White has pressure on the d5 pawn which is currently defended by the knight on c3\n5. Black's queen is under attack from the bishop on f6\n\nKey considerations:\n- The immediate threat is the bishop on f6 attacking the queen\n- We need to deal with this while maintaining our position\n- Moving the queen to safety is critical\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Qxd4 - This seems tempting as it wins a pawn, but after Nxd4 we lose the queen to Bxd4\n2. Qe8 - Retreating the queen to safety while connecting rooks\n3. Qd7 - Another safe retreat, but blocks the d-pawn\n4. Bxf6 - Trading the bishop, but after gxf6 we still have the queen issue\n\nAfter careful consideration, Qe8 seems best because:\n- It saves the queen\n- Connects the rooks\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the king too exposed.\n\n```\nQe8\n```"
