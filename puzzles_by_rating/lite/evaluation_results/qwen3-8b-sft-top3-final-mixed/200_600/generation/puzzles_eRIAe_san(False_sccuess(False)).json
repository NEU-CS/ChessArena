When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has Rook, Queen, Knight vs Black's Rook, Queen, Knight). Black has a passed pawn on d4, but it's blockaded.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on f4 is very active, attacking the e4 pawn and pinning the knight on e3 to the queen.\n- Black's knight on e3 is pinned and can't move without losing the queen.\n- Black's queen on c6 is somewhat exposed.\n- White's king is relatively safe while Black's king is still in the center.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4h4: Threatens mate on h7, but Black can defend with ...Qg6\n- f3g5: Attacks the pinned knight, but Black can play ...Qxg5\n- d3a6: Bishop sacrifice idea, but not immediately winning\n- f4d4: Capturing the pawn, but after ...Qxd4 White doesn't have a clear advantage\n- f3e5: Forking queen and rook, but Black can play ...Qxe5\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3g5:\n- It attacks the pinned knight on e3\n- If Black takes with ...Qxg5, then Rxe4 wins a pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qxe3 or other threats\n- It maintains all of White's positional advantages\n\nOther moves either don't capitalize on the pin or allow Black to defend more easily. f3g5 creates immediate threats that Black must respond to.\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
