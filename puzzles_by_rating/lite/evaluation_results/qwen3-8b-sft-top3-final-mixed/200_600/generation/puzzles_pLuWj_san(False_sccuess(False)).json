When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black is up a queen for a pawn, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on d4 is very active and threatening\n- White's rook on c8 is trapped and needs to be saved\n- White's bishop on f5 is pinned to the king by Black's bishop on f8\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black could play Qd4xc3 winning a pawn\n- Black could play Qd4-d1+ with a discovered attack on the rook\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: Need to save the trapped rook while minimizing damage\n- Bishop moves: f5h7 looks interesting to break the pin\n- King moves: g1h1 to get away from potential checks\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f5h7 seems tempting but after ...Bxh7, White loses the bishop and the rook remains trapped\n- c8 moves: c8c7 looks best as it saves the rook while keeping some activity\n- King moves: g1h1 is safe but doesn't address the rook issue\n\nThe best move appears to be c8c7, saving the rook while keeping it active on the 7th rank. This at least maintains some material equality and keeps fighting chances.\n\n```\nc8c7\n```"
