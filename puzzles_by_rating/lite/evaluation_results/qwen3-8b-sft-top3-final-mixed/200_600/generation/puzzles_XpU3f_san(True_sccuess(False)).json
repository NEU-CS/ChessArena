If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's bishop on e4 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's king is exposed on d2\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rh8+ next move if we don't address it\n- White's bishop on h6 is eyeing the g7 pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Kh8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- Rf8: Defends against Rh8+ but blocks the bishop\n- Bf5: Attacks the g4 pawn and maintains bishop activity\n- Bxc2: Wins a pawn but allows White counterplay with Rh8+\n\nAfter considering these options, Bf5 seems most promising because:\n- It maintains the strong bishop\n- It attacks the g4 pawn which is only defended by the h6 bishop\n- It keeps options open for both defense and counterplay\n- It doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or give up the strong bishop position.\n\n```\nBf5\n```"
