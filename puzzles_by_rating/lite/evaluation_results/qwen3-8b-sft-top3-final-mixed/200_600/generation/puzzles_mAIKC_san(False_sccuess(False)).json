When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and rook vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on a3 that could become dangerous.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e1, while Black's king is relatively safe on f8. Black's bishop on f3 is very active, eyeing the white king.\n\n3. Immediate threats: Black's rook on b3 is attacking White's pawn on a3. If White doesn't defend it, Black can take with Rxa3.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Defending the a3 pawn: a2b2 or a2a1\n- Activating the bishop: d8e7 or d8c7\n- Moving the king: e1d2 to get away from potential checks\n- Pushing the passed pawn: b3b4\n\n5. Best options:\n- a2b2 defends the pawn while keeping the rook active\n- d8e7 develops the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- e1d2 improves king safety\n\nAfter considering these, a2b2 seems most urgent as it defends the immediate threat to the a3 pawn. The rook on b2 can still participate in the game, and we maintain flexibility with other pieces.\n\n```\na2b2\n```"
