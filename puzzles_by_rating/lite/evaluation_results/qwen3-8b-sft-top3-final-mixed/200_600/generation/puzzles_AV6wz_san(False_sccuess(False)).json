When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's queen on f3 is very active and can create threats\n4. Black's rook on e8 is undefended\n5. Black's queen on e7 is somewhat awkwardly placed\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) Queen moves:\n- f3f6 looks tempting, attacking the rook and threatening Qxg7#\n- f3c6 also attacks the rook and threatens Qxb7\n- f3h5 threatens mate on h7\n\nB) Bishop moves:\n- d2h6 threatens mate on h7, but black can defend with Qg7\n\nC) Rook moves:\n- a1f1 brings the rook to the open file\n\nAfter considering these:\n- f3f6 is very strong as it attacks the rook and threatens mate. Black's only way to defend is Qxf6, but then we have Bxf6 winning the exchange.\n- f3h5 is also good, but black can defend with Qg7\n- d2h6 is tempting but black can defend with Qg7\n\nThe most forcing and strongest move appears to be f3f6, creating immediate threats that black cannot easily parry.\n\n```\nf3f6\n```"
