When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on g3 is very active, eyeing the g7 pawn and potentially threatening mate on g7\n- White's bishop on e5 is strong, controlling important diagonals\n- Black's king is exposed on h7\n- Black's queen on d7 is somewhat passive\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg7+ winning the pawn\n- White could also play Qg5+ forcing the king to move\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7h8 (king moves away from potential checks)\n- d7g4 (queen blocks the g-file and attacks the bishop)\n- d5e7 (knight blocks the e-file and defends g7)\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- h7h8 allows Qg5+ next move, forcing the king to h7 again\n- d7g4 looks tempting but after Bxg4 hxg4, White's queen remains very active\n- d5e7 seems most solid, blocking the e-file and defending g7\n\nThe knight move d5e7 also:\n- Covers the g7 pawn\n- Blocks the e-file from White's queen\n- Maintains the knight's activity\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5e7\n```"
