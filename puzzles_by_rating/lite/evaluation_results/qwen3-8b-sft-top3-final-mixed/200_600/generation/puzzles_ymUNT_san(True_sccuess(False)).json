When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a strong centralized position with bishops on d4 and e4, queen on g3, and rook on d1\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. White's pieces are more active and coordinated\n5. Black's knight on f6 is under pressure from White's bishop on e4\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the immediate threat to the knight on f6\n- Need to improve king safety\n- Need to activate Black's pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Nxe4 - trades knight for bishop, but after Bxe4 White's pieces remain very active\n2. Nh7 - retreats knight but leaves it passive\n3. Qe7 - connects rooks and defends e4, but allows White to play Bxf6\n4. Qd7 - similar to Qe7 but less flexible\n5. Kh8 - improves king safety but doesn't address other issues\n6. g6 - prepares to fianchetto bishop but is slow\n\nBest option seems to be Qe7:\n- Defends the e4 bishop\n- Connects rooks\n- Prepares to potentially double rooks on the e-file\n- Maintains flexibility for future plans\n\nOther moves either don't address the central tension or leave Black's position too passive.\n\n```\nQe7\n```"
