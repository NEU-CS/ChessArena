When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Knight, Bishop, 3 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop, 5 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White has some active pieces\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen on h6 is very active, eyeing the h7 pawn\n   - Black's king is exposed on h8\n   - White has a passed pawn on f6 that could be dangerous\n   - Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\n3. The only legal move given is Kxh7, which is forced due to the threat of Qxh7#.\n\n4. After Kxh7:\n   - White can play Qxh7+ Kg8 (only move)\n   - Then White has Rf8+ with a strong attack\n   - Black's position would be very difficult to defend\n\n5. Alternative ideas:\n   - There are no other legal moves available (no pieces can interpose or block the check)\n   - The king must take the queen to avoid immediate mate\n\nSince Kxh7 is the only legal move and necessary to avoid immediate checkmate, we must play it despite the resulting complications.\n\n```\nKxh7\n```"
