When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Knight, Bishop vs Black's Rook, Knight, Pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on e7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank\n- Black's king is exposed on b6\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a rook on a4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, threatening to promote the e-pawn\n- b5c7: Knight fork attacking king and rook\n- e3h6: Bishop move attacking the g7 pawn\n- f3g5: Knight move attacking f7\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- e7e8 looks very strong as it threatens to promote the e-pawn (e5-e6-e7-e8=Q)\n- Black can't stop the pawn promotion without losing material\n- After e7e8, if Black plays ...Rxe8, then Nxc7 wins the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, White can promote next move\n\nOther moves like b5c7 are good but don't have the same immediate threat. The rook lift to e8 is the most forcing and decisive move.\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
