If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Key features:\n- White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h5\n- Black's rook on a2 is very active, attacking the bishop on f2\n- White's rook on g5 is very active, eyeing the g7 pawn\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rg8+ next move, forcing the king to move\n- White could also play Bxg7, winning a pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: Ra1 looks safe but doesn't accomplish much\n- Rook checks: Rg2+ forces the king to h7, but then what?\n- Bishop moves: Bf1+ is interesting, forcing the king to move\n- Pawn moves: h6 could be considered to block the rook\n\nAfter considering these options, the most forcing and best move appears to be Bf1+, which:\n- Forces the king to move (only legal reply is Kh7)\n- Then after Kh7, we can play Rg2+ winning the bishop on f2\n- This leads to a favorable exchange of rooks and bishop, improving our position\n\nHere's the move sequence:\n1... Bf1+ 2. Kh7 Rg2+ 3. Kxg7 Rxg5\n\nThis leads to a better endgame for Black.\n\n```\nBf1+\n```"
