When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with Queen vs Rook)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's Queen on e6 is very active and threatening\n- White's Rook on d7 is also very active\n- Black's King is exposed on h8\n- Black's Rook on e8 is currently passive\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxe8 winning the Rook\n- White could also play Rxe8+ winning the Rook with check\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8g8: Gets the Rook to a safer square but still allows Qxe8\n- e8f8: Similar to g8\n- e8e7: Blocks the Queen's path to e8 but allows Rxe8+\n- h6h5: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- a6a5/c5c4: Pawn moves that don't help\n\n5. Best defensive idea:\nWe need to prevent both Qxe8 and Rxe8+. The only way to do this is to move the Rook to a square where it's protected by the King. e8e7 seems forced, even though it loses the Rook after Rxe8+, because other moves lose the Rook immediately.\n\nAfter e8e7 Rxe8+:\n- K moves (Kh7 or Kg7) both allow Qxe8 winning the Rook\n- But this is the only way to delay the loss and maybe create some counterplay\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
