If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Let's see what happens after that:\n\n- `Qxd6`  \n  - White must respond to the check.\n  - Possible replies: `Kb1`, `Ka2`, `Kc1`, etc.\n  - After `Qxd6`, Black gains material (rook) and removes a key attacker from the board.\n\nIs there any danger in playing `Qxd6`?\n\n- No immediate threats to the black queen after capturing on d6.\n- Black remains up material and simplifies the position favorably.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe best move here is clearly **`Qxd6`** \u2014 it wins material with check and improves Black's position significantly.\n\n```\nQxd6\n```"
