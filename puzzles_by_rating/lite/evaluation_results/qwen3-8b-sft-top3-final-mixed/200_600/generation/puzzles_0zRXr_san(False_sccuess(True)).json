When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black has a bishop pair advantage.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on c5 is very active, eyeing the b2 rook and g2 pawn\n- White's rook on g3 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's queen on b2 is somewhat exposed\n- Black's bishop on c6 is very strong, controlling key diagonals\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Qxb2 winning the rook\n- Black could play ...Bxg2 winning a pawn\n- Black could play ...Qd4+ with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b8: Protects the rook but leaves the queen exposed\n- b2f6: Attacks the bishop but allows ...Qxb2\n- g3g6: Attacks the bishop but allows ...Qxb2\n- c1c5: Interesting sacrifice to remove the strong bishop\n\nAfter careful consideration, c1c5 seems the most promising:\n- It sacrifices the exchange (rook for bishop) but removes Black's strong bishop\n- After ...Qxc5, White can play b2b8 pinning the queen to the king\n- This leads to a favorable endgame with rook and queen vs rook and queen\n\nThe move is:\n```\nc1c5\n```"
