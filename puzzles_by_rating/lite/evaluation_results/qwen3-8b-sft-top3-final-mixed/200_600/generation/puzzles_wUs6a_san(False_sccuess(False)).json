When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong bishop on h6 pinning the f8 rook to the king\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White's queen on g4 is very active, eyeing the g7 pawn and potentially threatening mate ideas\n5. Black's knight on h5 is under attack by the bishop on h6\n\nKey considerations:\n- The immediate threat is the bishop on h6 - we need to deal with this\n- We have several ways to handle the pin:\n  * Move the rook (f8e8/d8/c8/b8)\n  * Move the queen (e7f6/g5/h4)\n  * Move the knight (h5f6/f4/g3)\n  * Push g7-g6 to kick the bishop\n\nLooking at options:\n- g7g6 seems risky as it opens the g-file for White's rook\n- h5f6 blocks the bishop's pin but leaves the knight passive\n- e7f6 is interesting as it defends the rook and develops the queen\n- f8e8 is safe but passive\n\nThe most active and defensive move appears to be e7f6:\n- It breaks the pin by defending the rook\n- Develops the queen to a more active square\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Keeps options open for future play\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin properly or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\ne7f6\n```"
