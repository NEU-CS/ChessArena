When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook on f6 and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e2\n- Black's rook on f6 is very active\n- Black's rook on h3 is also active and threatening\n- White's bishop on e4 is strong but can be challenged\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h3h2: Threatening to promote the pawn, but White can play Kf2\n- f6f2+: Immediate check, but after Kxf2 Rxf2+ Kxf2, Black loses material\n- f6e6: Attacking the bishop, but White can defend with Bf5\n- h3g3: Pinning the bishop to the king, which looks very strong\n\n4. The most promising move is h3g3, creating a pin:\n- If White moves the bishop (e.g. Bf5), then Rg2+ wins the bishop\n- If White doesn't move the bishop, it's trapped and will be lost\n- This maintains Black's active piece play while restricting White\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate. The pin is the most forcing and disruptive move.\n\n```\nh3g3\n```"
