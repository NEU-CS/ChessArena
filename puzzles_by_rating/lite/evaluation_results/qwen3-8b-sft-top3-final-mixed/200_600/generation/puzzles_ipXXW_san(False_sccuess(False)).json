When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very active, attacking f6 and b8\n- Black's rook on a2 is threatening to capture the b2 pawn\n- Black's bishop on b5 is pinning the b2 pawn to the rook on a1\n- White's bishop on g5 is very strong, eyeing h6 and f6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f6: Capturing the pawn with check, but after ...gxf6 White's attack fizzles\n- e5b8: Capturing the rook, but after ...axb8 White loses the queen to ...Bxa1\n- g5h6: Threatening mate on g7, but Black can defend with ...g6\n- e5e6: Centralizing the queen more, but not creating immediate threats\n- a1a2: Trading rooks to relieve the pin, but gives up the active rook\n\n4. Best move appears to be e5f6+:\n- Forces the king to move (only legal reply is ...Kg7)\n- After ...Kg7, White can play Qxf7+ winning the knight\n- Even if Black tries ...Kxf6, White has Bxf6+ winning the queen back\n- The move maintains initiative and leads to material gain\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ne5f6\n```"
