When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a pawn (White has 3 pawns vs Black's 2), but Black has active pieces and White's king is exposed.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is stuck in the center (c1) with no castling rights\n- Black has a strong bishop pair and active queen\n- White's rook on b3 is very active, but Black's rook on e8 is also active\n- Black's queen on h5 is eyeing the weak f3 square\n\n3. Threats:\n- White has potential threats like Bxf3 or Qxh7 if Black isn't careful\n- Black needs to maintain pressure while preventing White's counterplay\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h5f3: Immediate threat, but after gxf3, Black's queen is trapped\n- h5e2: Interesting, threatening mate on c2, but White can defend with Kd1\n- e8e4: Centralizing the rook, but allows White to play Bxf3\n- d5e4: Bishop takes pawn, but after Rxe4, Black loses material\n- h5g4: Maintains pressure on f3, keeps queen active\n\nAfter considering these options, h5g4 seems strongest because:\n- It maintains pressure on f3\n- Keeps the queen active and safe\n- Prevents White from playing Bxf3 immediately\n- Prepares potential future threats like Qg3 or Qh4+\n- Doesn't allow White any immediate counterplay\n\nOther moves either allow White to escape pressure or risk losing material.\n\n```\nh5g4\n```"
