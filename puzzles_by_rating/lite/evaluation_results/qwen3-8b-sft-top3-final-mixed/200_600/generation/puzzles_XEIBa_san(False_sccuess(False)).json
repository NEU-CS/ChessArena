When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on a7 is very active, attacking the black king's position\n- Black's king is exposed on e7 with limited pawn cover\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4 that could become dangerous\n- White's rook on c1 is currently passive\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7a8: Rook lift to 8th rank, threatening mate\n- a7e7: Direct attack on king, but allows ...Kxe7\n- c1c6: Activating the rook to attack the bishop\n- h2h4: Pushing the pawn to create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be a7a8:\n- Threatens Ra8# next move\n- Black has no good way to prevent this (no pawn cover, no pieces can block)\n- If ...Kd7, then Rxa4 wins a pawn\n- If ...Kf7, then Rxa4 is still strong\n- Other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate\n\nThe move a7a8 creates an immediate mating threat that Black cannot adequately defend against, while also maintaining pressure on the a4 pawn.\n\n```\na7a8\n```"
