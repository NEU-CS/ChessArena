When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White's rook on e1 is tied to defending against the e5 pawn\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n5. White's king is also exposed on g1\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's rook on e5 is very active and threatening\n- White needs to either challenge this rook or create counterplay\n- The h4 pawn is potentially weak and could be a target\n- White's rook on a1 is inactive\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Rxe5 - trading rooks would relieve pressure but leave White's king exposed\n2. Re4 - challenging the e5 pawn directly\n3. h4 - preparing to push the h-pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n4. Kf1 - moving the king to safety\n\nAfter considering these:\n- Rxe5 seems too risky as after Rxe5 Rxe5, White's king is too exposed\n- Re4 looks most principled, directly challenging Black's strong rook\n- After Re4, if Black trades (Rxe4), White can recapture with Rxe4 and the position is simplified\n- If Black doesn't trade, White can maintain pressure\n\nOther moves like king moves or pawn pushes don't address the immediate rook pressure.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRe4\n```"
