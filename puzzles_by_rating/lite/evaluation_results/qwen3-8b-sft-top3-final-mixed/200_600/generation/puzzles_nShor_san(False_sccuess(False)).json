When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's queen on d7 is eyeing our undefended bishop on e2\n4. Our king is somewhat exposed with the f3 bishop pinning our rook\n5. We have some tactical opportunities due to the pin\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\nA) Defending the rook:\n- e1d2 (but then Qxe2 wins the bishop)\n- e1d1 (but then Qxe2 again)\n- e1b4 (but then Qxe2 and we lose material)\n\nB) Counterattacking:\n- e2a6 (bishop sacrifice) - interesting, after ...bxa6 we have Qxa6 with strong attack\n- e2b5 (threatening mate on f7) - but Black can defend with ...Qd6\n- e2c4 (attacking the queen) - but Qxc4 and we lose material\n\nC) King safety:\n- g1h1 (getting out of the pin) - but passive\n- c1d1 (developing and defending) - solid\n\nAfter careful consideration, e2a6 seems the most promising:\n1. It sacrifices the bishop but opens up a powerful attack\n2. After 1...bxa6 2.Qxa6, Black's king is exposed and we have threats like Qxc8+\n3. Black's pieces are uncoordinated to defend against this\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't capitalize on our attacking chances. The sacrifice leads to a strong initiative.\n\n```\ne2a6\n```"
