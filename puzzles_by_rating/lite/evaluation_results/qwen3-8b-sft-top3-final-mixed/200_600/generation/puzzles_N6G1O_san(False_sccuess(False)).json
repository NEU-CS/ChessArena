When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, bishop, pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e7 is very active, eyeing the black king's position\n- Black's king is exposed on c3\n- White's rook on h4 is well placed, controlling the h-file\n- Black's queen on b6 is somewhat passive\n- Black's bishop on f4 is active but can be challenged\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e3: Queen checks the king, forcing it to move\n- h4h3: Rook check, but king can take the rook\n- e7f6: Queen move attacking the bishop\n- e7e1: Queen move threatening the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7e3+:\n- It's a forcing check that drives the king further into danger\n- After Kc3-b2 (only legal move), White can play Qe3-b3+ winning the pawn on b3\n- This leads to a winning queen and rook vs queen and bishop ending\n- Other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ne7e3\n```"
