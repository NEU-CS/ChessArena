When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is equal, but White has a more active position.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on d6 is very active, attacking the bishop on c7\n- Black's rook on f2 is threatening White's king\n- White's bishop on e6 is very powerful, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6g8: Bishop sacrifice to open the h-file for the rook\n- d6d8: Rook sacrifice to expose the black king\n- d1d5: Bringing the rook into the attack\n- h1g1: Moving the king away from the rook threat\n\n4. The most forcing and promising move appears to be e6g8, sacrificing the bishop to open the h-file:\n- After e6g8 hxg8, White can play d6d8+ winning the bishop back with a strong attack\n- The black king will be very exposed on h8\n- White's rook on d6 will control the 6th rank\n- Black's rook on f2 is still a threat, but White can defend with moves like h1g1\n\nOther moves like d6d8+ immediately are less effective because after Kxd8, White doesn't have a clear follow-up. The bishop sacrifice is more forcing and leads to a better attack.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6g8\n```"
