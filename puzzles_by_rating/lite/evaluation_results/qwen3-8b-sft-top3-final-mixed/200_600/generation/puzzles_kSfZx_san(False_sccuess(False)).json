When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and rooks, no queens yet)\n2. Black has a strong knight on c6 and bishop on f6 eyeing the h4 square\n3. White's bishop on h5 is very active but potentially trapped\n4. Black's king is exposed on g7 with limited pawn cover\n5. White has a passed d-pawn that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- The bishop on h5 is under attack by the knight on f6\n- If we play Bxg6, we can open the h-file for our rook\n- The knight on d2 is pinned to the king by Black's bishop on f6\n- We have potential threats against Black's king\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h5g6 - Bishop takes pawn, opening h-file\n2. d2e4 - Centralizing the knight, but it's pinned\n3. d1g4 - Queen move attacking f6 bishop and g6 pawn\n4. g1h3 - Developing the knight with tempo on the bishop\n\nAfter considering:\n- h5g6 looks very strong as it opens the h-file against Black's king\n- After hxg6, if Black recaptures with hxg6, we can play Qg4 with strong threats\n- If Black doesn't take, we maintain pressure on the h-file\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate opportunity or allow Black to consolidate\n\nThe most forcing and promising move is to take the pawn with the bishop, opening lines against Black's king.\n\n```\nh5g6\n```"
