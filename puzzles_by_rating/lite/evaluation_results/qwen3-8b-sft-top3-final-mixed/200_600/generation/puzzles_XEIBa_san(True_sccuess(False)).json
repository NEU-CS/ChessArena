Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on f7 with limited pawn cover\n- White has two rooks that can potentially coordinate on the 7th rank\n- Black's bishop on c6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's pawn on b3 is under attack by Black's rook on b4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxe7+: This looks tempting as it attacks the king, but after Kxe7, White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- Rxc6: Removing the strong bishop, but after bxc6, Black gets connected passed pawns\n- Ra8: Threatening to invade the 8th rank, but Black can defend with ...Rb8\n- Rxe7+ followed by Rxc6: This combination seems promising as it removes the bishop after the king takes\n\n4. Best continuation appears to be:\n- Rxe7+ Kxe7 (forced)\n- Then Rxc6 bxc6 (forced)\n- Now White can play Ra8, threatening mate on f8 while also attacking the c6 pawn\n\nThis sequence leads to a favorable endgame where White's rook can dominate the 8th rank while Black's pawns are weak.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nRxe7+\n```"
