The white pawn is further advanced (e4 vs a6)\n2. Black's king is very active and can potentially stop the white pawn\n3. Black's pawn is still on its starting square\n4. White's king is somewhat passive on g8\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Kb3 - moves towards the white pawn\n2. Ka3 - also moves towards the pawn but less direct\n3. Kb2 - moves away from the pawn\n4. Kb1 - moves away from the pawn\n5. Ka1 - moves away from the pawn\n6. a5 - advances the pawn\n\nAnalysis:\n- a5 is tempting to push the pawn, but after e5 the white pawn will queen first\n- Kb3 is the most active move, heading towards the white pawn to stop it\n- After Kb3, White would likely play Kf7 to bring the king closer, but Black can continue Kc4 to stop the pawn\n- Other king moves away from the pawn are too passive and allow White to advance\n\nThe best move is to actively approach the white pawn with the king while it's still possible. The pawn push a5 is too slow and would lose.\n\n```\nKb3\n```"

Black has a pawn on a6 and a king; White has a king on g8 and a pawn on e5. It's Black to move.\n\n### Goal:\nBlack must try to promote the a-pawn or prevent White from promoting their e-pawn. The key is to calculate whether Black can win or at least draw.\n\n### Current Position Summary:\n\n- **White King**: g8 (cornered, but not yet in a zugzwang)\n- **White Pawn**: e5 (advanced, but not yet threatening promotion)\n- **Black King**: b3 (active, central)\n- **Black Pawn**: a6 (potential passer)\n\n### Legal Moves for Black:\n```\nKc4, Kb4, Ka4, Kc3, Ka3, Kc2, Kb2, Ka2, a5\n```\n\nWe need to evaluate each move and determine which one gives Black the best chance to win or secure a draw.\n\n---\n\n## Candidate Move Analysis:\n\n### 1. **a5** \u2013 Pushing the pawn forward.\n- This creates a passed pawn.\n- After **a5**, White cannot stop the pawn without giving up the e-pawn.\n- Let's see what happens after **a5**:\n  - White\u2019s best reply is likely **Kf7**, trying to race the king.\n  - Then **a4**, **a3**, **a2**, **a1=Q**.\n  - Black promotes first and wins.\n\n\u2705 Strong candidate.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Kc4 / Kb4 / Ka4 / Kc3 / Ka3 / Kc2 / Kb2 / Ka2** \u2013 King moves.\nThese all aim to support the a-pawn or try to intercept the e-pawn.\n\nBut moving the king away from supporting the a-pawn delay the promotion. Also, White may be able to use the king to stop the a-pawn while advancing the e-pawn.\n\n\u274c Less effective than pushing the pawn immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **a5**, advancing the pawn and forcing White to respond. Black will promote first and win.\n\n```\na5\n```"

King moves (`Kc4`, `Kb4`, etc.)\n- These are slower and give White more time to react.\n- The king is already in a decent position to support the pawn.\n- Moving the king now may allow White to gain tempo or counterplay.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- The best plan is to **push the a-pawn** as quickly as possible.\n- Delaying with king moves gives White time to bring the king closer or push the e-pawn.\n- `a4` is the most direct and effective move here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\na4\n```"

Black has a king and a pawn on a4, while White has a king and a pawn on e7. The key elements:\n\n- **White's pawn on e7** is one square away from queening.\n- **Black's king** is on b3, and it needs to stop the e-pawn from promoting.\n- **Black's pawn on a4** is far advanced but not yet a threat unless supported by the king.\n- **White's king** is on g8, far from the action on the queenside.\n\n### Goal for Black:\nPrevent White's e-pawn from promoting. If that's not possible, try to promote your own a-pawn.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the list of legal moves:\n- `Kc4`, `Kb4`, `Kc3`, `Ka3`, `Kc2`, `Kb2`, `Ka2`, `a3`\n\nWe must choose the move that gives Black the best chance to either:\n- Stop the e-pawn, or\n- Promote the a-pawn if stopping the e-pawn is impossible.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Each Move:\n\n#### `Kc4`\n- King moves toward the center.\n- Still too far to reach e7 in time.\n- Not ideal.\n\n#### `Kb4`\n- King moves closer to the e-file.\n- Still too slow to stop e7-e8=Q.\n- Not ideal.\n\n#### `Kc3`\n- Slightly more central.\n- Still too far from e7.\n- Not ideal.\n\n#### `Ka3`\n- King moves toward the queenside.\n- Too far from e7.\n- Not ideal.\n\n#### `Kc2`\n- King moves toward the center.\n- Still too far from e7.\n- Not ideal.\n\n#### `Kb2`\n- King moves toward the queenside.\n- Too far from e7.\n- Not ideal.\n\n#### `Ka2`\n- King moves toward the queenside.\n- Too far from e7.\n- Not ideal.\n\n#### `a3`\n- Pushes the pawn forward.\n- This is the only move that creates a real threat: promoting the a-pawn.\n- If Black can promote first, it may be able to draw or even win depending on timing.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight:\n\nWhite's e-pawn is about to promote. Black's king is too far to stop it. Therefore, Black must **try to promote its own pawn** as quickly as possible.\n\nThe best way to do that is to push the a-pawn immediately.\n\nIf Black plays `a3`, then after White promotes (`e8=Q`), Black can play `a2` and then `a1=Q`. It's a race, but at least Black is trying to create counterplay.\n\nAny king move wastes time and allows White to queen with no opposition.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is to **push the pawn** and start the race.\n\n```\na3\n```"
