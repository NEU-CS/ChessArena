If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a passed d-pawn but it's currently blocked.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a strong bishop on f4 eyeing the white king\n- Black's rook on c4 is very active\n- White's rook on d3 is tied to defending the d4 pawn\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Bxd2 winning the exchange\n- Black could play ...Rxd4 winning a pawn\n- Black could play ...Rc1+ with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rd4: Defends the d4 pawn but allows ...Bxd2\n- Nf5: Attacks the bishop but allows ...Bxd2\n- Kc2: Gets the king to safety but allows ...Bxd2\n- cxb4: Opens the c-file but allows ...Rxc4\n- d6: Pushes the passed pawn but allows ...Bxd2\n\n5. Best move seems to be Rd4:\n- It defends the d4 pawn\n- After ...Bxd2, we can play Rxd2 Rxd2 and then Kc2, getting the king to safety\n- Other moves either lose material or allow too much counterplay\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\nRd4\n```"
