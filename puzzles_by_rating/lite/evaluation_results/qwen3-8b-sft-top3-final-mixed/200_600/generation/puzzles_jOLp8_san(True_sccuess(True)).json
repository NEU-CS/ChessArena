When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Knight, 2 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 4 pawns\n   - Black is up a bishop and pawn, but White has some active pieces\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's queen is very active on e5, eyeing the g3 pawn\n   - Black's rook on f1 is attacking White's rook on a1\n   - White's king is exposed on g2\n   - Black's bishop on f4 is pinning White's pawn on g3 to the king\n\n3. The only legal move given is Kxf1, which would:\n   - Capture Black's rook on f1\n   - But after Kxf1, Black can play Qxg3+ winning the pawn\n   - Then White would have to move the king (Kh1 or Kf2)\n   - Black would have a strong attack with Qg4+ coming\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\n   - There are no other legal moves available (no pieces can be moved)\n   - The king must capture the rook on f1\n\n5. Consequences:\n   - After Kxf1 Qxg3+ Kh1 Qg4+ Kh2 Qxh4, Black is up a queen for a rook and knight\n   - The position would be lost for White\n\nSince Kxf1 is the only legal move, we must play it despite the difficulties:\n\n```\nKxf1\n```"
