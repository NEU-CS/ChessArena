When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

It's White's move (55th move)\n\nEvaluation:\n- White is up a pawn (2 vs 1)\n- Both sides have passed pawns\n- White's pawns are more advanced\n- Black's pawn is closer to promotion but White's king is better placed\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Kh7 - moves king away from action\n2. Kg7 - similar to Kh7\n3. Kf7 - centralizes king but may be too slow\n4. Kh6 - prepares to push h-pawn\n5. Kf6 - centralizes king\n6. Kg5 - moves toward black pawn\n7. Kf5 - centralizes king\n8. h6 - advances pawn but may be premature\n9. g5 - advances pawn but may be premature\n\nBest plan:\n- White should centralize the king to support both pawns while preventing Black's king from interfering\n- The move Kf6 seems most flexible, keeping options to go to either side of the board\n- After Kf6, White can consider pushing the g-pawn next move while keeping the king active\n\nOther moves:\n- Kg5 is also reasonable but may allow Black's king to get closer to the h-pawn\n- h6 or g5 are premature as they fix the pawn structure too early\n\nAfter Kf6, possible continuation:\n1. ... Kc3\n2. Ke5 Kd3\n3. Kf5 Ke3\n4. Kg5 Kf3\n5. h6 and White should win\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nKf6\n```"
