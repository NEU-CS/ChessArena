When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen, rook, knight. Material is equal, but White has a passed a-pawn that could become dangerous.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1, while Black's king is relatively safer on f7. Black has threats with the rook on c4 and knight on g4 eyeing White's king.\n\n3. Immediate threats: Black's queen on b2 is attacking White's rook on b1. The knight on g4 is also threatening to jump to f2 or e3 with check.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b1b2: Trading queens, but after Qxb2 Rxb2, Black's rook remains active\n- h2g4: Capturing the knight, but after fxg4, Black's pawn structure improves\n- a8h8: Moving the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- b1g1: Moving the rook to safety while keeping it active\n\nAfter considering these options, the best move appears to be b1g1. This:\n- Gets the rook out of attack from the queen on b2\n- Keeps the rook active on the g-file\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either give up material or allow Black to improve their position. b1g1 is the most solid choice that maintains White's position.\n\n```\nb1g1\n```"
