When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong bishop on g6 pinning the f6 pawn to the king\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White's queen on f4 is very active, eyeing the f7 pawn\n5. Black's queen on d6 is under attack from the bishop on g6\n\nKey considerations:\n- The immediate threat is the bishop pin on f6, which could lead to material loss if not addressed\n- Black needs to deal with the queen and bishop coordination against f7\n- The king safety is a major concern\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h8g8 - Gets the rook off the pin but leaves the king exposed\n2. f8g8 - Similar to above but blocks the bishop's diagonal\n3. c8d7 - Develops the bishop but doesn't address the immediate threat\n4. d6e7 - Moves the queen away from attack while defending f6\n5. d6d8 - Retreats the queen but seems passive\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d6e7 seems best as it:\n  - Gets the queen out of attack\n  - Maintains defense of f6 pawn\n  - Keeps options open for counterplay\n  - Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. For example, moving the rook (h8g8/h8h7) would leave the king very exposed to potential attacks along the g-file.\n\n```\nd6e7\n```"
