When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Knight, Bishop vs Black's Rook, Knight, Pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on f7 is very active, attacking the f7 pawn which is only defended by the king.\n- Black's king is exposed on b6.\n- White has a passed e5 pawn that could become dangerous.\n- Black's rook on a4 is active but not immediately threatening.\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxf7: Wins a pawn but allows Black's rook to become more active.\n- Rxe6+: Checks the king, forcing it to move. After Kc6, White can play Rxe6+ Kd7 and the rook is trapped.\n- Nc7: Forking king and rook, but Black can play Kxc7.\n- Bxc5+: Checks the king, but after Kxc5, White doesn't have a clear follow-up.\n- Rxe6+: This seems most promising as it traps the rook after the king moves.\n\n4. Calculating Rxe6+:\n- Rxe6+ Kd7 (only move)\n- Now the rook is trapped on e6, and White can play Rxe6 Kxe6\n- Then Nc7+ forks king and rook, winning the rook on a4\n\nThis sequence wins material while maintaining the initiative. Other moves either don't win material or allow Black to escape with the rook.\n\n```\nRxe6+\n```"
