If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- Black's queen on c4 is eyeing the g8 square (potential discovered check)\n- Black's rook on d8 could potentially swing to d1 with check\n- Black's pawn on e4 is cramping White's position\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Nxg6: Wins a pawn but allows Qxg6 with discovered check\n- Ne6+: Interesting check, but after fxe6 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- Qxg6+: Looks tempting, but after fxg6 Nxg6+ Kxg6, White loses material\n- Qg5: Pins the f6 pawn, but Black can defend with Qd4\n- Bxc4: Removes the dangerous queen, but after dxc4 White's position remains cramped\n- h4: Creates luft for the king, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be Qxg6+:\n- Forces the king to take: Kxg6\n- Then Nxg6+ Kxg6\n- Now White can play Bxc4, removing Black's active queen\n- After dxc4, White has a passed h-pawn that can be pushed\n\nThe sequence leads to a roughly equal endgame where White's passed pawn might be decisive. Other moves either lose material or don't address Black's threats.\n\n```\nQxg6+\n```"
