When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (f6), Bishop (e5), pawns (b4, g4, h3, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (a2), Bishop (c7), Bishop (f1), pawns (h6)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on a2 is very active and threatening\n- White's rook on f6 is well placed, controlling the f-file\n- White's bishop on e5 is strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's bishop on f1 is pinning White's rook on h1 to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h3h4: Advances the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h1f1: Captures the bishop, but after Rxf1, White's king is exposed\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black's rook can capture the h2 pawn (Ra2xh2)\n- Black's bishop can capture the rook on h1 (Bxh1)\n\n5. Best move:\n- h1f1 is forced to eliminate the pin and capture the bishop\n- After h1f1 Rxf1, White can play Rxf1, maintaining material equality\n- The position remains complex but White avoids immediate disaster\n\nThe alternative h3h4 doesn't address the immediate threats and would allow Black to capture the h2 pawn.\n\n```\nh1f1\n```"
