When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black has a very active queen on g5 and rook on f5, eyeing the f2 pawn\n3. White's king is exposed on g1 with limited pawn cover\n4. Black's bishop on d7 is very strong, controlling the long diagonal\n5. White has a passed pawn on d2 that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's threats include Qxf2+ or Rxf2, so we need to address this\n- Our bishop on c4 is very active but needs to be careful about getting trapped\n- The d2 pawn is our main asset, but we need to protect it\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d2d6 - Pushing the passed pawn immediately, but after ...Bxd6 we lose it\n2. c4g8 - Bishop sacrifice to eliminate the dangerous rook, but after ...Kxg8 we're still under pressure\n3. e3f4 - Blocking the queen's attack on f2 while developing the bishop\n4. g1h2 - Moving the king to safety\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e3f4 seems most principled, blocking the queen's attack on f2 while developing the bishop to a strong diagonal\n- It maintains our pawn structure and doesn't create new weaknesses\n- After e3f4, if Qxf4 then Nxf4 and we've eliminated the dangerous queen\n- If Black doesn't take, we maintain control of f4 and can consider pushing d2-d6 next move\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. The king move g1h2 is too passive and doesn't improve our position.\n\n```\ne3f4\n```"
