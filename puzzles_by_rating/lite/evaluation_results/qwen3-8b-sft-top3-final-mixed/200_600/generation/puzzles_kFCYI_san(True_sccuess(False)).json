When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Key features:\n- Black has a strong passed pawn on d5\n- White's king is exposed but currently safe\n- Black's rook on c5 is very active\n- White's rook on b4 is under attack by the bishop on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rb6+: Checks the king and forces it to move, but after ...Ka7 the rook is still under attack\n- Bxd4: Capturing the bishop, but after ...Rxb4 Rxb4 the position remains complicated\n- Rb7: Defends the rook while keeping pressure on the 7th rank\n- a5: Pushes the passed pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- Kh1: Improves king safety but is passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be Rb7:\n- Defends the rook from the bishop\n- Maintains pressure on the 7th rank\n- Keeps options open for future play\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Rb7 is the most solid choice that maintains White's position.\n\n```\nRb7\n```"
