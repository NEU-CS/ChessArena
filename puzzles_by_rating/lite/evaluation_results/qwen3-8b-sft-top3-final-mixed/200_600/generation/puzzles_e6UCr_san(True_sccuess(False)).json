When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White's pawn is very advanced (a6) and close to promotion\n2. Black's pawn is still on f5 and not yet threatening to promote\n3. Black's king is tied to defending against the a-pawn\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Kc6 - moves towards the f-pawn but leaves a6 pawn undefended\n2. Kc5 - similar to Kc6 but less direct\n3. Ka5 - protects the a6 pawn but doesn't make progress\n4. Kc4 - moves away from the pawn\n5. Kb4 - moves away from the pawn\n6. Ka4 - moves away from the pawn\n\nBest move is Kc6 because:\n- It attacks the f5 pawn immediately\n- After Kc6, Black must defend the pawn with Ka8 (only move)\n- Then White can play Kd5 next, winning the f-pawn\n- White's a-pawn will queen first and win the game\n\nOther moves either don't make progress or allow Black counterplay with the f-pawn.\n\n```\nKc6\n```"
