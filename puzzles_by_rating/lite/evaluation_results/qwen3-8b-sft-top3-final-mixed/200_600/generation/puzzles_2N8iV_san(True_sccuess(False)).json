Key features:\n- White has a strong rook on g6, attacking the g7 pawn and eyeing the 7th rank\n- Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous\n- Black's queen is active but potentially overextended on b5\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qg5+ next move, forcing the king to move and potentially winning material\n- White's rook on g6 is very active and needs to be addressed\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rg8: Defends g7 but blocks the rook's activity\n- Qxb4: Wins a pawn but leaves the queen exposed\n- Kd7: Gets the king to safety but allows Qg5+\n- Rd7: Blocks the d-file but doesn't solve the g6 rook issue\n- Qc4: Centralizes the queen and defends b4\n\nAfter considering these options, Qc4 seems most promising because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Defends the b4 pawn\n- Prepares to double rooks on the d-file\n- Maintains flexibility to address the g6 rook threat later\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either leave the king exposed or don't address the immediate threats. While Qxb4 is tempting, it leaves the queen too exposed to attacks from the g6 rook.\n\n```\nQc4\n```"
