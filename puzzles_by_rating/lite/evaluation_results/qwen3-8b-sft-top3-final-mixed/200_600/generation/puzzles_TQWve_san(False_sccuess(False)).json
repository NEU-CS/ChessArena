When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, knight, pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a strong bishop on f4 attacking our rook on d3\n- Black's rook on c4 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n- White has a passed pawn on d5 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d3f3: Blocking the bishop's attack while developing the rook\n- e1e3: Moving the rook to defend the d3 rook\n- g3h5: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- d5d6: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Evaluating options:\n- d3f3 looks tempting but after ...Bxf3, White loses material\n- e1e3 is solid but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- g3h5 is interesting as it attacks the bishop, but after ...Bxh5, White's position remains tense\n- d5d6 is the most dynamic option, creating immediate threats\n\n5. After d5d6:\n- If ...exd6, then Rxd6+ wins the bishop\n- If ...exd6, then Rxd6+ Kf7, Rxc6 with a strong attack\n- Black might play ...Bxd6, but then Rxd6+ Kf7, Rxc6 again with advantage\n\nThe passed pawn push seems most promising as it creates immediate threats and forces Black to react. The other options either don't address the position's needs or lead to complications that aren't clearly advantageous.\n\n```\nd5d6\n```"
