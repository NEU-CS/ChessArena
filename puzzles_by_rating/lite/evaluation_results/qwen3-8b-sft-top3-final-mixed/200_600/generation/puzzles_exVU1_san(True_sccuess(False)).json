When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Current position:\n- Black has a king on b4 and pawn on d5\n- White has king on g2 and knight on d3\n- It's Black's move (as indicated by \"b\" in the FEN)\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's knight is attacking Black's pawn on d5\n- Black's king is close to White's pawn on c4\n- The position is very simplified with only a few pieces left\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Kb5: Moves king away from pawn, but doesn't address the knight threat\n- Kd4: Moves king towards center but still leaves pawn hanging\n- Kxd3: Captures the knight but allows White to promote the c-pawn\n- Kc3: Moves king towards White's pawn\n- Kb3: Similar to Kc3 but less active\n- d4: Pushes the pawn but leaves it unprotected\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- Kxd3 seems tempting but after Kxd3, White plays c4 and will promote the pawn\n- Kc3 is better as it both defends the pawn and threatens to capture it next move\n- After Kc3, if White plays Nf4 (to defend c4), Black can play Kxc4 and the position is drawn\n- Other moves either lose material or allow White to promote\n\n5. Conclusion:\nKc3 is the most precise move, maintaining the draw by either capturing the pawn or keeping the king active.\n\n```\nKc3\n```"
