When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook on b7 and e4, pawns on a2, c2, f2, g2, h2. Black has a rook on d8, bishop on e5, pawns on a5, e6, f7, g7, h7. Material is roughly equal (White has 2 rooks vs Black's rook+bishop).\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's bishop on e5 is strong, controlling important squares\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed with the pawn structure\n- White's king is safe on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7b8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, threatening to penetrate\n- b7f7: Attacking the f7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- e4e5: Challenging the bishop and opening lines\n- e4h4: Attacking the h7 pawn\n\n4. Deep analysis:\n- b7b8 looks tempting but after ...Rd7, White's rook might get trapped\n- b7f7 is very strong as after ...Kxf7, Rxf7+ wins the bishop\n- e4e5 is interesting but after ...Bxe5, Rxe5 opens the position favorably for White\n- e4h4 is less forcing\n\nThe most forcing and winning move appears to be b7f7, attacking the f7 pawn which is only defended by the king. After:\n- If Black plays ...Kxf7, then Rxf7+ wins the bishop\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Rf8+ or other threats\n\nThis seems like the most direct path to advantage.\n\n```\nb7f7\n```"
