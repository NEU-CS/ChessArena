If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. White's rook on e5 is very active and threatening\n5. Black's rook on e8 is tied to defending against potential back rank threats\n\nKey observations:\n- White is threatening to play Re8+ winning the exchange\n- Black needs to address this immediate threat\n- The bishop on f5 is pinned to the king by White's rook on e5\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Kh8 - gets the king away from potential checks but leaves the pin\n2. Rxe5 - trades the dangerous rook but loses the bishop after Bxe5\n3. Re7 - blocks the pin but allows Re8+ winning the exchange\n4. Bg6 - breaks the pin but allows Re8+ anyway\n5. Red8 - moves the rook to defend the back rank while maintaining the pin\n\nAfter careful consideration, Red8 seems best because:\n- It defends against Re8+ by covering the back rank\n- Maintains the pin on the f5 bishop\n- Keeps the rook active on the open file\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the king vulnerable. While Red8 doesn't solve all problems, it's the most resilient option.\n\n```\nRed8\n```"
