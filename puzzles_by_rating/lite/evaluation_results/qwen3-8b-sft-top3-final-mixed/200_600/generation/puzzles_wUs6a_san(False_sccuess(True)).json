When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong bishop on h6 pinning the f8 rook to the king\n3. White's queen on g4 is very active, eyeing the g7 pawn and potentially threatening mate on g7\n4. Black's knight on h5 is under attack by White's queen\n5. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the rook on f8 pinned\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Qxg7# if we don't address it\n- We need to deal with the pin on the f8 rook\n- The knight on h5 is attacked and needs to be moved or defended\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h5f6 - moves the knight to safety while attacking the bishop\n2. f8e8 - unpins the rook but allows Qxg7#\n3. e7g5 - blocks the queen's path to g7 while developing the bishop\n4. g7g6 - prevents mate but weakens the dark squares\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- h5f6 seems best as it saves the knight and attacks the bishop\n- After h5f6, if Bxf6 then Qxf6 and we've eliminated the dangerous bishop\n- Other moves either allow mate or don't address the threats\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nh5f6\n```"
