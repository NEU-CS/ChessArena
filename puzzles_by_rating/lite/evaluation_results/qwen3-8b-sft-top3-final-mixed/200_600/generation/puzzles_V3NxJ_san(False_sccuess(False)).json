When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on b1 is very active, controlling the b-file\n- Black's rook on d5 is centralized but potentially vulnerable\n- White's bishop on c3 is well placed, eyeing the a5 square\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b1b5: Rook invasion, attacking the rook on d5\n- c3a5: Bishop sacrifice, but not immediately clear\n- c5c6: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn\n- b1b8: Rook lift to the 8th rank\n\n4. Best move seems to be b1b5:\n- Attacks the rook on d5\n- If Black moves the rook (say Rd7), then Bxd5 exd5 and White has a strong passed pawn on c5\n- If Black plays ...Rxb5, then Bxb5 and White's bishop dominates\n- Maintains pressure while keeping all options open\n\nOther moves like c3a5 are tempting but don't lead to immediate concrete advantages. The rook move is more forcing and maintains initiative.\n\n```\nb1b5\n```"
