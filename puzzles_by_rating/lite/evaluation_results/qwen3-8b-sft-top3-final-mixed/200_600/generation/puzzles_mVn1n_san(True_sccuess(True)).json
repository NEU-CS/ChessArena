When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Q, R, R, B, 4 pawns\n   - Black has: Q, R, R, B, 5 pawns\n   Material is roughly equal, but White has a very active queen on f8.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen is attacking Black's rook on e7\n   - Black's king is exposed on g8\n   - White has a passed pawn on c5\n   - Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on c6\n\n3. The only legal move given is Qxf8, which would:\n   - Capture White's queen\n   - But after Qxf8, White can play Rxe7+ winning the rook\n   - Then Black would have to move the king (Kf7 or Kh7)\n   - White would have a strong attack with Rxe7+ followed by Rf1 or similar\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\n   - There are no other legal moves available (no pieces can move except the queen)\n   - The rook on e7 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on d3\n   - The bishop on b7 is blocked and can't move\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Qxf8 is forced, despite the drawbacks\n   - After Qxf8 Rxe7+, Black can try to defend but White will have a strong initiative\n   - There are no better alternatives\n\nTherefore, the only move to play is:\n\n```\nQxf8\n```"
