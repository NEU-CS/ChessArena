When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a bishop on g4 attacking our f3 square (though we don't have a piece there yet)\n3. Our bishop on d4 is very active and has several options\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) which could be a target\n5. We have castling rights (KQ) but haven't castled yet\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n\n1. d4g7 - Bishop takes pawn with check, forcing the king to move. This looks very promising as it:\n   - Wins a pawn\n   - Forces the king to move (likely to f8)\n   - Opens the g-file for our rook\n   - After ...Kxg7, we can castle queenside with strong pressure\n\n2. d4f6 - Bishop takes knight, but this allows ...gxf6 and we lose our strong bishop\n\n3. d4e5 - Centralizing the bishop, but doesn't create immediate threats\n\n4. Castling (h1g1) - Safe but doesn't take advantage of Black's exposed king\n\n5. f1a6 - Developing the bishop, but not as forcing as taking on g7\n\nThe most forcing and advantageous move appears to be d4g7, as it:\n- Wins material immediately\n- Maintains strong pressure\n- Keeps the initiative\n- Leads to a favorable position after the king moves\n\nOther moves either don't capitalize on the opportunity or allow Black to consolidate.\n\n```\nd4g7\n```"
