When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a strong centralized queen on d4 and bishop on c3\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White's king is also exposed but has some pawn cover\n5. Black's rook on f8 is under attack by White's pawn on g4\n\nKey observations:\n- White is threatening to win the rook with g4xf5, so we must address this\n- Our queen is very active and can create threats\n- We need to protect the rook while maintaining our initiative\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qxe2+ - This looks tempting as it forks the king and rook, but after Kxe2 we lose material\n2. Rfe8 - Protects the rook but blocks our own queen's activity\n3. Qf6 - Attacks the queen while defending the rook\n4. Qe6 - Similar idea, but less active than Qf6\n\nAfter considering these options, Qf6 seems strongest because:\n- It defends the rook on f8\n- It attacks White's queen\n- It maintains our queen's activity\n- After Qxf6, we can recapture with gxf6, equalizing material and opening the g-file for our rook\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or sacrifice material. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nQf6\n```"
