When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (b4), Rook (c3), Bishop (e5), Bishop (e2), pawns (c2, g2, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (d8), Rook (d1), Bishop (a2), pawns (a7, b7, f5, g7, h7)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has two active rooks and bishops.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on f5 supported by the bishop on a2\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's rook on d1 is very active and threatening\n- White's rook on b4 is attacking the f4 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e2f1: Moves the bishop to f1, protecting the king but blocking the rook's defense of f4\n- e2d1: Captures the rook on d1, but after ...Bxd1, Black's bishop becomes very active\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- e2d1 seems tempting but after ...Bxd1, Black's bishop dominates the board and White's king remains exposed\n- e2f1 is safer, keeping the rook defending f4 and maintaining some coordination between pieces\n- After e2f1, if Black takes f4 with ...fxe4, White can play Rxd8+ winning the rook\n\nThe safer choice is e2f1, maintaining piece coordination and defending the f4 pawn.\n\n```\ne2f1\n```"
