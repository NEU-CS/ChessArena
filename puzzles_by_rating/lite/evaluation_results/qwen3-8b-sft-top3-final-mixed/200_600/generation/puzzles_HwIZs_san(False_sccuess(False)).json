When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen on c4 is very active, eyeing the g8 square\n- White's knight on f4 is well placed but could be more active\n- Black's rook on d8 is controlling the d-file\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Qxg4 winning a pawn\n- Black could also play ...Rd1+ with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4g6: Knight fork attacking queen and rook\n- g3g6: Queen sacrifice to expose black king\n- f1c4: Blocking the queen's attack on g4\n- h1g1: Moving king to safety\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- f4g6 looks tempting as it forks queen and rook, but after ...Qxg6 White loses material\n- g3g6 is a queen sacrifice that leads to complications but might be winning\n- f1c4 blocks the threat but allows ...Rd1+ with counterplay\n- h1g1 is safe but passive\n\nThe best move appears to be g3g6, sacrificing the queen to expose Black's king. After:\n1. Qg6 fxg6\n2. Nxg6+ Kh7\n3. Nf4 with a strong attack against the exposed king.\n\n```\ng3g6\n```"
