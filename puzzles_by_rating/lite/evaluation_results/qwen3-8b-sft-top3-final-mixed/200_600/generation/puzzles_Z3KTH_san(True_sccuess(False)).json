If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Material is equal, but White has a more active position.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on d6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's rook on f2 is very active, threatening the g2 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's immediate threat is Rf2xg2, winning a pawn\n- White needs to address this while maintaining initiative\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- Bg8: Blocks the rook's path to g2, but allows Rf2xg2 anyway\n- Bf7: Blocks the rook's path to g2 and attacks the rook\n- Rd8: Attacks the bishop on c8, but doesn't address the threat\n- Rf1: Defends g2, but allows Black to play Rf2xg2 anyway\n- Bf5: Doesn't address the threat\n\n5. Best move:\nBf7 is the most forcing move:\n- It blocks the rook's path to g2\n- It attacks the rook on f2\n- If Black takes the bishop (Rxf7), then Rxf7 wins the rook\n- If Black moves the rook, White can play Bxg8 winning material\n\nAfter Bf7, Black's best reply would be Rf2xg2, but then Bxg8 Kxg8 Rxf2 and White is up a rook for a bishop.\n\n```\nBf7\n```"
