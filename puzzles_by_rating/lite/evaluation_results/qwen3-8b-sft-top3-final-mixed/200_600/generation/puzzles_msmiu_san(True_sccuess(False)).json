When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop + pawn vs Black's knight + 2 pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's pawns are more advanced.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop is very active on h5\n- Black's knight on f1 is threatening to fork king and bishop with Ne3+\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on f3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Be8: Blocks the e-file but allows Ne3+ winning the bishop\n- Bf7: Attacks the king but allows Ne3+ winning the bishop\n- Bg6: Pins the f7 pawn but allows Ne3+ winning the bishop\n- Bg4: Protects f3 but allows Ne3+ winning the bishop\n- Kg2: Gets out of potential knight forks but allows Black to push pawns\n- Kf2: Similar to Kg2 but less safe\n- Ke2: Gets out of potential knight forks but allows Black to push pawns\n- g6: Pushes the pawn but allows Ne3+ winning the bishop\n- a4: Only pawn move that doesn't lose material immediately\n\n4. The main problem is the knight fork threat. All bishop moves lose the bishop to Ne3+. The king moves allow Black to push pawns but at least keep material balanced.\n\n5. a4 is the only move that doesn't lose material immediately and maintains some pawn structure. After a4, Black can still play Ne3+ but White can respond with Kg2, and the position remains complicated but playable.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na4\n```"
