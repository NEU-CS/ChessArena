When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Qh6, Pf6, Pb2, Kg2\n   - Black has: Ke8, Ra7, Rd7, Pb6, Pe7, Pf7\n   - Material is roughly equal (White has queen vs Black's rook + bishop)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen is very active on h6, threatening various things\n   - Black's king is exposed on e8\n   - White has a passed pawn on f6 that could become dangerous\n   - Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on f7\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - f8g8: King moves to g8\n   - f8e8: King moves to e8 (but this would be into check from the queen!)\n\n4. Evaluating f8e8:\n   - This would place the king in check from the queen on h6\n   - It's an illegal move as it would put the king in check\n   - Therefore, this is not a valid option\n\n5. Evaluating f8g8:\n   - King moves to g8, getting away from the queen's diagonal\n   - This seems like the only legal move available\n   - After Kg8, White can play Qxh7, but Black can respond with Rg7\n   - The position remains complicated but playable\n\nSince f8e8 is actually illegal (it would put the king in check), the only valid move is f8g8. The position is difficult for Black, but this is the only way to continue.\n\n```\nf8g8\n```"
