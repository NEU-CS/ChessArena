If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has two active rooks.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on c6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's queen on d5 is very active\n- White's queen is currently on e3, somewhat passive\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rxc8: Wins the exchange (rook for bishop) but allows Black to play Qxc6\n- Qxe4: Wins a pawn but gives up the queen's activity\n- c7: Pushes the passed pawn but allows Black counterplay\n- Qg5+: Checks the king and brings the queen to an active square\n\n4. Best move seems to be Qg5+:\n- Forces the king to move (only legal reply is Kh8)\n- Then we can play Rxc8 winning the exchange\n- After Rxc8 Qxc6, White is up a rook for bishop and pawn\n- The c-pawn is still dangerous and White's pieces are active\n\nOther moves either don't maximize our advantage or allow Black counterplay. Qg5+ is the most forcing and leads to a clear material advantage.\n\n```\nQg5+\n```"
