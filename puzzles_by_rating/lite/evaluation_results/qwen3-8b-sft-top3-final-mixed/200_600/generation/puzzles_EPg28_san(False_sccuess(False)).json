When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and pawn (White has queen + rook vs Black's rook + bishop). White's queen is very active on e5.\n\n2. Immediate threats:\n- White's queen is attacking the rook on e8\n- White's rook on d1 is eyeing the d-file\n- White has potential threats against Black's king\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has potential mating threats with queen and rook coordination\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 - moves king away from potential checks but doesn't address the rook threat\n- e8e7 - blocks the queen's attack on the rook while keeping the rook defended\n- a2b3 - bishop move that doesn't address immediate threats\n- e8f8 - moves rook away but leaves it passive\n\nThe most critical issue is the attack on the rook on e8. Moving the rook to e7 (e8e7) seems best because:\n- It blocks the queen's attack on the rook\n- The rook remains defended by the king\n- It maintains some activity for the rook\n- It doesn't expose the king further\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or worsen Black's position. For example, moving the king (g8h8) leaves the rook hanging, and bishop moves don't help with the material imbalance.\n\nAfter e8e7, Black can consider trying to activate the bishop next move if White doesn't find immediate threats.\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
