If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black has a strong bishop on f3 attacking White's queen\n3. Black's queen on e7 is eyeing the b4 square and could become very active\n4. White's king is somewhat exposed with the f3 bishop pinning the knight on g1\n5. Black has a passed pawn on d7 that could become dangerous\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to deal with the threat to the queen\n- Need to address the pin on the f3 bishop\n- Need to consider king safety\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Bxf3 - trades bishop for knight, but after gxf3 the pawn becomes dangerous\n2. Qd3 - moves queen to safety while attacking the bishop\n3. Qa4 - moves queen to safety while eyeing the a7 pawn\n4. Rf1 - defends the f3 bishop but leaves queen hanging\n5. gxf3 - trades pawn for bishop, but opens the g-file\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qd3 seems most principled, getting the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- It also keeps the option to castle queenside if needed\n- The bishop on f3 is still a problem, but we can deal with it later\n- Other moves either leave material hanging or create new weaknesses\n\nThe best move is:\n```\nQd3\n```"
