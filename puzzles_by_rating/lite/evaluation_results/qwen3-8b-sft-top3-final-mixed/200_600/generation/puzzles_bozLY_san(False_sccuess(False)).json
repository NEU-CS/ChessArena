When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, queen, bishop, knight vs White's queen, bishop, knight, rook). White has a passed pawn on b5, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d4 is very active, eyeing the f6 pawn and potentially threatening Qd6+.\n- Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited pawn cover.\n- Black's rook on f8 is passive, while White's rook on h1 is ready to swing to the kingside.\n- Black's queen on e7 is somewhat restricted by its own pawns.\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qd6+ next move, forcing Black's king to move and potentially winning material.\n- White might also consider Qxg6, but that's not immediately threatening.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8e8: Connecting rooks and getting the rook off the vulnerable f-file\n- e7e8: Queen moves to e8 to defend against Qd6+ and potentially double rooks\n- e7d7: Queen moves to d7 to defend the b5 pawn and keep pressure on d4\n- a8e8: Rook moves to e8 to defend against Qd6+\n\nAfter considering these options, e7e8 seems most prudent because:\n- It directly addresses the Qd6+ threat by covering the d6 square\n- It keeps the queen active and connected with the rook\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new vulnerabilities. For example, moving the rook from f8 would leave the e-file open, and moving the queen elsewhere might allow Qd6+ with tempo.\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
