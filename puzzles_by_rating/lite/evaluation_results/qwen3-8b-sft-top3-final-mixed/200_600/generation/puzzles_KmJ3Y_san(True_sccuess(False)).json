When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on f6 is very active, attacking the f1 square\n- Black's rook on a2 is threatening to capture the b4 pawn\n- Black's bishop on f1 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on f5\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h3\n\n3. Candidate moves:\na) Kh4 - moves the king to a safer square but doesn't address the immediate threats\nb) Rxf1 - captures the pinned bishop, but after Rxf1, Black can play Rxb2 winning a pawn\n\n4. Deeper analysis:\n- After Rxf1 Rxf1, White can play Bxf1, but then Black has Rxb2 and the position is roughly equal\n- Kh4 seems safer, keeping the rook on f6 to maintain pressure\n- The b4 pawn is currently defended by the bishop on f5\n\n5. Best move:\nKh4 is the safer choice, keeping the rook active and maintaining the pin on the bishop. The king is moving to a slightly safer square while keeping all options open.\n\n```\nKh4\n```"
