If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight. Black is up a minor piece.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e5, attacking f6 and e6\n- Black has a strong bishop pair and active rooks\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n- Black's knight on f6 is defending key squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxf6: Wins the knight but allows Bxe5 winning the queen\n- Qxe6: Wins the bishop but allows Bxe5\n- Qd5: Centralizes queen and threatens Qxf7+\n- Bh6: Threatens mate on g7 but can be defended\n- Rxa2: Wins a pawn but seems too slow\n\n4. Best options:\n- Qd5 looks strong as it maintains pressure and threatens Qxf7+\n- After Qd5, if Black plays ...Bxe5, then Qxe5 maintains material equality\n- Other queen moves either lose material or don't create threats\n\n5. Other considerations:\n- Need to be careful about Black's threats like ...Rae8 or ...Bf5\n- Can't allow Black to consolidate their advantage\n\nAfter careful consideration, Qd5 seems like the most active and principled move, maintaining pressure while improving the queen's position.\n\n```\nQd5\n```"
