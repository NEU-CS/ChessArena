When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, Bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White might be slightly better)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has a rook on f1 that's attacking Black's queen on f7\n- Black's queen is undefended and will be captured if White plays Rxf1\n- After Rxf1, Black will likely recapture with Rxf1\n- White's queen on e2 is very active and can potentially deliver checkmate\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Only legal move is Rxf1 (rook takes queen)\n\n4. Consequences of Rxf1:\n- Black must recapture with Rxf1\n- Then White can play Qe8+ (queen check)\n- Black's only move is Kh7\n- Then White can play Qxe7+ winning the bishop\n- This leads to a winning endgame for White\n\nThe move Rxf1 is forced and leads to a clear advantage for White. There are no other legal moves to consider.\n\n```\nRxf1\n```"
