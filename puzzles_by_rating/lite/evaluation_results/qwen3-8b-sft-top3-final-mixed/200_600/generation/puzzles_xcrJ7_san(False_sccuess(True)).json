When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on a6 is very dangerous, eyeing the a-file and potentially threatening Ra1+ in some lines\n- Black's king is exposed on b1\n- Black's bishop on e6 is somewhat restricted by its own pawns\n- White's king is active on c3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6c8: Blocks the rook's path to a1, but leaves the bishop passive\n- e6d7: Similar to c8, but slightly more active\n- e6f5: More active, but allows Ra1+ next move\n- b1c1: Gets the king away from potential checks, but allows Ra1+\n- b3b2: Pushes the pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to prevent Ra1+ which would be devastating\n- b1c1 seems most prudent, getting the king away from the a-file\n- After b1c1, if Ra1+ then Kb2 and we're still okay\n\n5. Other moves:\n- e6 moves allow Ra1+ with check, which is dangerous\n- Pawn pushes don't address the immediate threat\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to get the king away from potential checks:\n\n```\nb1c1\n```"
