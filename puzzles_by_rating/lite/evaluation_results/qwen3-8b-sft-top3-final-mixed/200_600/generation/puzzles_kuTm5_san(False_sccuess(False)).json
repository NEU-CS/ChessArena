When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the f5 knight potentially creating threats\n4. White's pieces are more active, especially the queen on c3 eyeing the b7 pawn\n5. Black's dark-squared bishop is very strong, controlling key squares\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the threat to b7 pawn\n- Need to activate the rook on f8\n- Need to deal with White's potential threats against f7\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. f8e8 - Rook lift to connect rooks and defend b7\n2. c7c6 - Defends b7 and prepares to develop the bishop\n3. e6d7 - Moves bishop to a safer square while maintaining control\n\nAfter considering:\n- f8e8 looks most flexible, connecting rooks and defending b7\n- c7c6 is solid but blocks the bishop's diagonal\n- e6d7 is okay but doesn't address the rook activity\n\nThe best move appears to be f8e8, improving the rook's position while maintaining all defensive needs.\n\n```\nf8e8\n```"
