If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a strong bishop on e4 attacking White's rook on e1\n- White's queen is very active on a6\n- Black's king is exposed with weak dark squares around it\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Qxa7: Wins a pawn but allows Black to play ...Bxg2 winning the rook\n- Qxg6: Wins a pawn but allows ...Bxg2\n- Qf6+: Checks the king, but after ...Kg8 White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- Rxe4: Capturing the bishop, but after ...Qxe4 White's position remains complicated\n- c5: Pushing the passed pawn, but Black can respond with ...Bxc5\n- Bh6+: Interesting check that forces the king to move\n\n4. Best move seems to be Bh6+:\n- Forces the king to move (only legal reply is ...Kg7)\n- After ...Kg7, White can play Qxg6 winning a pawn with tempo\n- The bishop on h6 is very strong, eyeing the f8 square and controlling key diagonals\n- Maintains pressure while developing an initiative\n\nOther moves either allow Black to win material or don't create enough threats. Bh6+ is the most forcing and promising move.\n\n```\nBh6+\n```"
