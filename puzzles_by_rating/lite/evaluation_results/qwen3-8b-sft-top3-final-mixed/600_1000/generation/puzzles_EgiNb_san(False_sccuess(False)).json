When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook (c6), Rook (d6), Queen (c2), pawns (c5, e3, f2, h2)\n- Black has: Rook (c8), Queen (e5), pawns (d5, g6, h7)\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rooks are very active on the 6th rank\n- Black's queen is centralized but potentially exposed\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g1g2: Moves king towards center but exposes it to potential checks\n- g1h1: Moves king to corner, which is generally safer\n- g1f1: Moves king towards center but away from potential checks\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Qe1+ if king moves to f1\n- Black could play ...Rc1+ if king moves to g2\n- Black's queen is eyeing the f2 pawn\n\n5. Best choice:\n- g1h1 is safest as it moves the king to a corner where it's harder to attack\n- From h1, the king can potentially move to g2 next if needed\n- Other moves leave the king more exposed to checks\n\nAfter careful consideration, the safest move is:\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
