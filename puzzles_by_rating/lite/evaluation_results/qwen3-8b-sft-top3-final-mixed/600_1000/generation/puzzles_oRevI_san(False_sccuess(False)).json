When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's rook on h7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- Black has a passed pawn on h4 that could become dangerous\n- White's pawn structure is slightly better with connected passed pawns on a2 and b3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7h8: Rook lift to 8th rank, but doesn't immediately threaten anything\n- h7g7: Attacks the black king, but allows ...Rg8 defending\n- h7f7: Pins the f6 pawn to the king, very strong\n- h5h6: Pushes the pawn, but allows ...Kxh6\n- b3b4: Advances the pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be h7f7:\n- Creates an absolute pin on the f6 pawn\n- If ...K moves, then Rxf6 wins a pawn\n- If ...R moves, then Rxf6+ wins the pawn anyway\n- Maintains all other advantages\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black counterplay with the h-pawn. The pin is very strong here.\n\n```\nh7f7\n```"
