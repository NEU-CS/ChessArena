When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White might be slightly better)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White's queen on h6 is very active, attacking h7 pawn and eyeing f8\n- Black has a rook on h3 threatening White's rook on f1\n- White's bishop on d5 is strong, controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves:\nOnly legal move given is g2h3 (king takes rook). Let's evaluate:\n\n- After g2xh3:\n  - Black can play Qd6+ forcing White's king to move (Kh1 or Kg1)\n  - If Kh1, then Qh6+ wins the queen\n  - If Kg1, then Qg5+ wins the queen\n  - In both cases, White loses the queen for a rook - bad trade\n\n4. Alternatives:\nThere are no other legal moves available (all other pieces are pinned or can't move without losing material). The position is forced.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nWhile the move g2h3 leads to losing the queen, it's the only legal move. The position is lost for White, but we must make the move.\n\n```\ng2h3\n```"
