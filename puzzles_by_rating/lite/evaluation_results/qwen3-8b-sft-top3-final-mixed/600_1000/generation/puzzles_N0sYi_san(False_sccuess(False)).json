When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black is up a queen for a rook, but White has some active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on h3 is very active and threatening\n- White's queen on g5 is also active but potentially trapped\n- Black has a rook on e8 eyeing the e-file\n- White's rook on a7 is very active but could be vulnerable\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen can deliver mate with Qxh2#\n- White needs to address this mate threat immediately\n\n4. Candidate moves to stop mate:\n- g5h6 blocks the queen's path to h2\n- g5h5 also blocks\n- f1f5 blocks with the rook\n- c3d5 blocks with the knight\n\n5. Evaluating g5h6:\n- After Qxh6, White can play Rxh6, but then Black has Bxh6 and White is down material\n- Not ideal\n\n6. Evaluating f1f5:\n- After Qxh2#, it's mate\n- Not good\n\n7. Evaluating c3d5:\n- After Qxh2#, it's mate\n- Not good\n\n8. Evaluating g5h5:\n- This seems best as it blocks the mate threat\n- After Qxh5, White can play Rxh5, and while down material, it's better than immediate mate\n- The position remains complicated but playable\n\nAfter careful consideration, g5h5 is the only move that prevents immediate mate while maintaining some counterplay. Other moves either allow mate or lose more material.\n\n```\ng5h5\n```"
