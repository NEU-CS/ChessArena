When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop pair and more space, but Black has a queen and rook vs White's queen and bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on h4 is very active, eyeing the g2 pawn\n- White's bishop on e4 is under attack by the queen\n- Black has a passed e-pawn that could become dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Bishop moves: e4a8 (discovered check), e4h7 (attacks queen), e4b7 (attacks rook)\n- Queen moves: c2a4 (attacks queen), c2d3 (defends bishop)\n- King moves: g1g2 (gets out of potential discovered checks)\n- Pawn moves: f2f4 (attacks queen)\n\n4. Best options:\n- e4h7 looks tempting as it attacks the queen, but after Qxh7, White loses the bishop\n- c2a4 is interesting as it attacks the queen, but Qxa4 Bxa4 and Black has Rxa2 winning a pawn\n- g1g2 is solid, getting the king to safety and preventing any discovered checks\n- e4a8+ is a discovered check that wins the rook after Kxa8, but then Qxa8 and Black has Qxh2 winning a pawn\n\nAfter considering these, g1g2 seems most prudent:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Prevents any discovered checks\n- Maintains material equality\n- Keeps all pieces active\n\nThe other moves either lose material or give Black counterplay. While not the most aggressive, it's the safest choice in this position.\n\n```\ng1g2\n```"
