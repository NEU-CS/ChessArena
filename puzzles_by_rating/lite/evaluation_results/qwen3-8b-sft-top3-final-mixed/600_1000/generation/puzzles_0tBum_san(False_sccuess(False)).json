When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, and pawns)\n2. White's queen on e4 is very active and threatening\n3. Black's queen on g5 is also active but potentially exposed\n4. White has a passed e5 pawn that could become dangerous\n5. Black's king is somewhat exposed with the f8 rook still on its original square\n\nKey observations:\n- White's queen is attacking the g5 queen\n- Black needs to deal with the immediate threat to the queen\n- The g5 queen is also eyeing the e3 square (potentially threatening the bishop)\n- The e6 bishop is pinned to the king by White's rook on f1\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5e7 - Queen moves to defend the bishop while attacking the rook\n2. g5f6 - Queen moves to safety while attacking the e5 pawn\n3. e6d7 - Bishop moves to unpin and defend the queen\n4. f8e8 - Rook moves to defend the queen\n\nAfter considering these:\n- g5e7 looks tempting but after Qxe7 Bxe7, White's rook can take the bishop\n- g5f6 is safer but doesn't address the pin\n- e6d7 is interesting but allows Qxd7 winning a piece\n- f8e8 is solid, defending the queen while keeping the bishop protected\n\nThe best move appears to be f8e8, which:\n- Defends the queen on g5\n- Maintains the pin on the bishop\n- Keeps options open for future play\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\n```\nf8e8\n```"
