When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black is up a queen for a rook, but White has some compensation with active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on d1 is very active, eyeing the white king\n- White's rook on c7 is very active, pinning the black bishop on b7 to the king\n- Black's rook on d2 is attacking the white queen on f2\n- White's knight on f1 is defending the queen\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black threatens Qxf2# if the knight moves\n- Black also has potential threats with the rook on d2\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7c8: Rook sacrifice to remove the pin, but after ...Qxc8 White's position remains difficult\n- f2b6: Queen moves to b6, attacking the bishop and potentially threatening mate on b7\n- f2d4: Queen moves to d4, attacking the rook on d2\n- f2h4: Queen moves to h4, getting away from the rook's attack while maintaining pressure\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f2b6 looks tempting but after ...Bxb6, White's position collapses\n- f2d4 is interesting but after ...Rxd4, Nxd4 Qxd4 and White is lost\n- f2h4 is the safest, getting the queen to safety while maintaining pressure on g7 and h7\n\nThe best move is to get the queen to safety while maintaining threats:\n\n```\nf2h4\n```"
