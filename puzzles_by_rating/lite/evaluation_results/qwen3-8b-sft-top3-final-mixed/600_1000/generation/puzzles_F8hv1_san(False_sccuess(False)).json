When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has king + rook + bishop vs White's king + rook + pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed e6 pawn that's very dangerous.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's e6 pawn is one move from queening (e6-e7)\n- White's rook on a7 is very active and controls the 7th rank\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6e7: Blocking the pawn with the bishop, but after Rxe7 Kxe7, White has Rxc6 winning a pawn\n- c4c5: Challenging the e6 pawn, but after exf7+ Kxf7, White has Rxc6 with a winning position\n- g8h8: Moving the king to safety, but doesn't address the e6 pawn threat\n- f6g5: Attacking the g3 pawn, but White can still push e7\n\n4. Best defensive idea:\nWe need to stop the e6 pawn while maintaining our rook's activity. The move c4c5 seems most principled because:\n- It challenges the e6 pawn immediately\n- If exf7+, we can play Kxf7 and our rook remains active\n- It opens the c-file for our rook\n- It prevents White from playing Rxc6 immediately\n\nAfter c4c5, if exf7+ Kxf7, we have Rc7 pinning the a7 rook to the king, which looks promising.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc4c5\n```"
