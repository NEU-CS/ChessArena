When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and pawns vs White's two rooks and pawns. Black is down material but has some counterplay.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on b4 that could become dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed but White's king is also not perfectly safe\n- Black's rook on g8 is under attack by White's rook on c6\n- Black's rook on g6 is very active but could be vulnerable\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8/g8f8: Moving the rook away from attack\n- g6g7: Protecting the rook while maintaining pressure\n- g6f6: Centralizing the rook\n- b6a6: Moving the pawn to block the rook's attack\n\n4. Best options:\n- g6g7 seems most logical as it protects the rook while maintaining pressure on White's position. It also prevents White from playing Rc7+ in some lines.\n- g8h8 is safe but passive and allows White to improve their position.\n- Other rook moves either don't address the immediate threat or lose material.\n\n5. Potential threats:\nAfter g6g7, White might play Rc7+ but Black can respond with Kd7, and the position remains balanced. White's passed pawn is still a concern but Black can try to create counterplay with the h-pawn.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ng6g7\n```"
