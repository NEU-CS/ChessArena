When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, queen, rook and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen, rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on h5 is very active and threatening\n- Black's queen on f5 is unprotected and vulnerable\n- White's queen on b4 is eyeing the b7 pawn\n- Black's bishop on a2 is pinning White's pawn on c2 to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5g7: Forking king and rook, but Black can play ...Rxg7\n- h5f6: Attacking the queen, but Black can play ...Qxf6\n- b4b7: Capturing the pawn with check, but Black can block with ...Rd7\n- a1g7: Rook sacrifice to remove the dangerous queen, but after ...Kxg7 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- f3b7: Bishop sacrifice to remove the rook, but Black can play ...Qxb7\n\n4. Best move appears to be h5g7:\n- It's a knight fork attacking both the king and rook\n- Even though Black can take with Rxg7, White gets compensation:\n  - The queen on f5 is still under attack\n  - White can follow up with Qxb7+ winning the rook\n  - Black's king will be very exposed\n\nAfter h5g7 Rxg7, White can play Qxb7+ Kd8 (if ...Kg8 then Qxg7) and White is up material with a strong attack.\n\n```\nh5g7\n```"
