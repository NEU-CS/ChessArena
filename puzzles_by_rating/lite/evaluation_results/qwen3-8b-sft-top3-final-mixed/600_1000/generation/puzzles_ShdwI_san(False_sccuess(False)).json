When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully as Black.\n\nKey features of the position:\n1. White has a strong attack with the queen on h5 and knight on g5, eyeing f7 and h7.\n2. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover.\n3. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated, with the rook on e8 and bishop on c8 not participating in defense.\n4. White has a knight fork threat on d4 (knight could go to f3 or b5).\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h8g7 - Developing the bishop to defend f5 and g5 squares\n2. e8f8 - Moving the rook to a safer file\n3. c8d7 - Developing the bishop to a more active diagonal\n4. d4f3 - Counterattacking with the knight\n\nAfter considering:\n- h8g7 looks most urgent to defend against White's threats. It covers f5 and g5, and prepares to bring the bishop into play.\n- e8f8 is passive and doesn't address the immediate threats.\n- c8d7 is too slow and doesn't help with the king safety.\n- d4f3 allows Qxf3 winning material.\n\nThe best move is to develop the bishop to g7 to defend against White's attacking pieces while also preparing to connect the rooks.\n\n```\nh8g7\n```"
