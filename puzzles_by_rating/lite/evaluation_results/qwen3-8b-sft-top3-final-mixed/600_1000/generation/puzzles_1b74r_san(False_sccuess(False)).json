When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a pawn (White has Q vs Black's R), but White's queen is very active on b7.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen is attacking the rook on a8\n- White's knight on h5 is very strong, eyeing f6 and g7\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed in the center (still on e8)\n- White has potential threats with the bishop on d5 pointing at f7\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8f6: Developing the knight and defending e8, but allows Qxa8\n- f8e8: King moves to safety but leaves rook hanging\n- d8e7: Blocking the queen's attack on the rook while developing the queen\n- h5e8: Interesting sacrifice to remove the dangerous queen\n\nAfter careful consideration, h5e8 seems the most promising:\n- It sacrifices the knight to remove White's powerful queen\n- After Qxe8, Black can play Qxe8, trading queens and relieving pressure\n- The resulting position would be more balanced with Black's active pieces\n\nOther moves either lose material or leave the king exposed. The knight sacrifice is the most forcing way to relieve pressure.\n\n```\nh5e8\n```"
