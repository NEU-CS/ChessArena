When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's rook, rook, knight, bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b7 is very active, attacking the rook on a8 and threatening to capture the knight on f6\n- Black's queen on d5 is unprotected and could be a target\n- White's knight on e5 is well placed, attacking f7 and g6\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7a8: Capturing the rook, but after ...Qxa8 White doesn't have a clear follow-up\n- e5f7: Forking king and rook, but Black can play ...Kxf7\n- e5g6: Attacking the bishop, but Black can defend with ...h5\n- b7f7: Queen sacrifice to remove the defender of f7, but after ...Kxf7 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- e3e4: Centralizing the rook and attacking the queen, but Black can just move the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5g6:\n- Attacks the bishop on h5\n- If Black defends with ...h5, then Qxh5 wins a pawn\n- If Black moves the bishop, we can consider Qxf7 next move\n- Maintains pressure on f7 and keeps the initiative\n\nOther moves either don't create enough threats or allow Black to consolidate. e5g6 keeps the initiative and creates immediate problems for Black.\n\n```\ne5g6\n```"
