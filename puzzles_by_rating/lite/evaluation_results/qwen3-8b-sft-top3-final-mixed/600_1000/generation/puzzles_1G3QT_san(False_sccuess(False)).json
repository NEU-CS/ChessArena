When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen on f3 is very active\n- Black's queen on g5 is under attack by White's rook on d6\n- Black's rook on f8 is pinned to the king by White's rook on d6\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Qxg5 winning the queen\n- White could play Rxf8+ winning the rook\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8g8 - unpins the rook but allows Qxg5\n- e7e8 - blocks the pin but allows Qxg5\n- g5h6 - moves the queen away but allows Rxf8+\n- g5g6 - moves the queen but allows Rxf8+\n- e7f7 - blocks the pin and defends the queen\n\nAfter careful consideration, e7f7 seems best because:\n- It blocks the pin on the f-file\n- It defends the queen on g5\n- It maintains material equality\n- It keeps the rook on f8 defended\n- It prevents immediate tactical disasters\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow immediate tactical blows.\n\n```\ne7f7\n```"
