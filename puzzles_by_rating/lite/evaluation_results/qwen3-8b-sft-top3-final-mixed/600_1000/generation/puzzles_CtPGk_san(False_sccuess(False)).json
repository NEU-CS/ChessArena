When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (Black has 2 rooks vs White's queen and rook).\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen is very active on e5, eyeing the black king\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has potential threats like Qe5-f6+ or Qe5-g5+\n- Black's rooks are not well coordinated\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: g8h8 or g8f8 to get away from potential checks\n- Rook moves: e8e7 to block the queen's diagonal, or c7e7 to challenge the queen\n- Pawn moves: h7h6 to prevent Qg5+\n\n4. Best options:\n- e8e7 looks tempting to block the queen's diagonal, but after Qxe7+ Kxe7, White has Rd1-d7 winning a rook\n- c7e7 is better, attacking the queen. If Qxe7+ Kxe7, then Rxe7+ Kxe7 and Black is down material but has some compensation\n- g8h8 is safe but passive\n- h7h6 prevents Qg5+ but doesn't address the queen's activity\n\nAfter considering these, c7e7 seems the most principled move, forcing the queen trade and reducing White's attacking potential. Even if White doesn't take, it forces the queen to retreat.\n\n```\nc7e7\n```"
