When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on h6 is very active, attacking the black king on d4\n- Black's king is exposed in the center\n- White has a passed pawn on b6 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that's close to promotion\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, threatening mate\n- h6h7: Rook moves closer to the king\n- d2e1: King moves away from potential checks\n- f2f4: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n\n4. Critical threats:\n- Black's d3 pawn is one move from queening\n- Black's rook can check from b2 or b1\n\nAfter considering these factors, h6h8 seems strongest because:\n- It threatens immediate mate with Rh8#\n- Black has no good way to prevent this (king can't move to e3 due to rook check, can't move to c5 due to pawn capture)\n- Even if Black tries to push d3d2, White can play Rh8# next move anyway\n- Other moves either don't address the mate threat or allow Black counterplay\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nh6h8\n```"
