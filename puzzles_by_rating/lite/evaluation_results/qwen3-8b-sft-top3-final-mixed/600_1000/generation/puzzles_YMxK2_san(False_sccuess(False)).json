When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized position with pieces active (queen on d3, knight on c3, bishop on f3)\n3. Black's king is still in the center (e8) which is dangerous\n4. Black's dark-squared bishop on b4 is very active, pinning the knight on c3\n5. White has threats like Qd3xe7+ or Bf3xe7 winning material if Black isn't careful\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the immediate threats to the king\n- Need to develop the position while maintaining the pin on c3\n- Need to connect rooks\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e8g8 (castling) - gets king to safety but leaves the pin on c3\n2. e8f8 - moves king away but still leaves it exposed\n3. b4c3 - capturing the knight but allowing Qxe7+\n4. d8e7 - developing the queen and protecting e7\n5. g6e7 - knight move defending e7\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Castling (e8g8) is the most principled move, getting the king to safety while connecting rooks\n- Other moves either leave the king exposed or give up material\n- The pin on c3 can be maintained after castling as White can't immediately exploit it\n\nThe best move is:\n```\ne8g8\n```"
