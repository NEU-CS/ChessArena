When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, and pawns)\n2. Black has a very active queen on g5 attacking g2 and eyeing the f2 pawn\n3. Black's bishop on d3 is very strong, controlling key squares\n4. White's king is somewhat exposed with the rook on e1\n5. Black has threats like ...Qxg2 or ...Bxg2\n\nKey observations:\n- The immediate threat is Qxg2, which would win a pawn and expose White's king\n- We need to address this threat while maintaining our own activity\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. Qc2-c6: Attacks the rook on e8 and defends g2\n2. Qc2-d3: Captures the bishop but allows Qxg2\n3. Qc2-e2: Defends g2 but seems passive\n4. g2-g3: Defends against Qxg2 but weakens the kingside\n5. e1-e2: Gets the king to safety but seems too passive\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Qc6 is the most active move, attacking the rook while defending g2\n- After Qc6, if Black takes the rook with Qxc6, we can recapture with bxc6, maintaining material equality\n- Other moves either don't address the threat or are too passive\n\nThe best move is:\n```\nc2c6\n```"
