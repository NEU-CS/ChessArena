When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's rook, queen, rook. Material is roughly equal, but White has a strong initiative.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on c7 is very active, attacking the rook on f7 and threatening mate on g7\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has a rook on f1 attacking White's rook on f1\n- White's bishop on c4 is very strong, controlling key squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7g7: Immediate queen sacrifice to force mate (Qxg7+ Kxg7 Rxf7#)\n- c4g8: Bishop sacrifice to open the h-file (Bxg8 Rxg8 Qxg8+ Kxg8 Rxf7)\n- Other queen moves that maintain pressure\n\n4. Calculating c7g7:\n- Qxg7+ Kxg7 (forced)\n- Rxf7+ Kh6 (only move)\n- Rxf1 and White is up a rook with a winning position\n\n5. Calculating c4g8:\n- Bxg8 Rxg8\n- Qxg8+ Kxg8\n- Rxf7 and again White is up a rook\n\nBoth lines win material, but c7g7 is more forcing and leads to immediate mate threats. The queen sacrifice is sound because after Qxg7+ Kxg7, White's rook on f1 is protected by the bishop on c4.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most forcing and decisive move is:\n\n```\nc7g7\n```"
