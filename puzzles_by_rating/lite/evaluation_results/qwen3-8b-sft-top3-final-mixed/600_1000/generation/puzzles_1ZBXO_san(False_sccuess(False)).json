When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on e6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- Black has doubled rooks on the d-file\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6g8: Bishop sacrifice to open the king\n- c3d5: Knight jump to active square\n- f2f5: Pushing the pawn to create threats\n- a3a4: Advancing the passed pawn\n\n4. Deep analysis:\n- e6g8 looks tempting as it forces the king to move (Kxg8) and then we can play Rd1 with strong pressure\n- After e6g8 Kxg8, Rd1 pins the rook to the king\n- Black would have to play Rd7 to defend, but then we can play Rd8+ winning the rook\n- This seems like a forced sequence leading to material gain\n\nOther moves don't offer such immediate tactical opportunities. The bishop sacrifice is sound because after all the variations, White comes out ahead in material.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ne6g8\n```"
