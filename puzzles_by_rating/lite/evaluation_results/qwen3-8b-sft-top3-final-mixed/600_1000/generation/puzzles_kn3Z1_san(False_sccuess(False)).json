When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

You are playing **Black**, and it's your turn to move.\n\n### Material:\n- **White**: King on f7, Rook on c4, Pawn on g2\n- **Black**: King on h7, Rook on a5, Pawns on b7 and a6\n\n### Goals for Black:\n- Try to promote a pawn or create a passed pawn.\n- Avoid losing the rook or getting into a stalemate.\n- Be careful of White\u2019s rook and king coordination.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### King moves:\n- `h7h8`: Moving the king to h8. This doesn't help much and may restrict the king.\n- `h7h6`: Moving the king to h6. This could be useful to support a potential ...b5 break or to centralize the king slightly.\n\n#### Rook moves:\n- `a5h5`: Rook to h5 \u2013 attacking the White king? But the White king is on f7, so this is not effective.\n- `a5g5`, `a5f5`, `a5e5`, `a5d5`, `a5c5`, `a5b5`: These all move the rook along the 5th rank or file. Some of these might try to attack the White rook or control files.\n- `a5a4`, `a5a3`, `a5a2`, `a5a1`: Moving the rook down the a-file. Could be trying to support the a-pawn or b-pawn.\n\n#### Pawn moves:\n- `b7b6`: Advances the b-pawn. This opens up space and could allow the rook to become more active.\n- `b7b5`: A more aggressive push, creating a passed pawn immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe key idea here is that **Black has two pawns on the queenside (a6 and b7)**, and **White has a rook and king**. The best plan for Black is to **create a passed pawn** and try to promote it.\n\nBetween `b7b5` and `b7b6`:\n\n- `b7b5` is more aggressive and creates an immediate threat of a passed pawn.\n- It also gives the rook on a5 more scope to support the pawn or attack the White rook.\n\nSo, the best move is:\n\n```\nb7b5\n```"
