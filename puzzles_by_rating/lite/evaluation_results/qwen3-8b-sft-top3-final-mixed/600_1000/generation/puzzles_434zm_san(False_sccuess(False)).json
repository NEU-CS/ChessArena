When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance and threats:\n   - White has a queen on d5, rook on e1, pawns on a4, b2, c2, f3, g2, h2\n   - Black has a rook on e8, queen on h4, pawns on a5, b7, c7, f7, g7, h7\n   - White's king is on f2, black's king is on g8\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Black's queen on h4 is very active and threatening\n   - White's queen on d5 is also active but not immediately threatening\n   - Black has a rook on e8 that could potentially join the attack\n   - White's king is somewhat exposed on f2\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - f2g1: King moves to g1, but this walks into potential checks from the black queen\n   - f2f1: King moves to f1, which is safer but still leaves the king exposed\n   - g2g3: Pawn moves to g3, blocking the queen's diagonal to f2\n\n4. Evaluating g2g3:\n   - This prevents Qh4xf2# (mate)\n   - It also blocks the queen's attack on the f3 pawn\n   - After g3, black might play Qxh2, but then white can respond with Qxh5\n   - The pawn move also opens the g-file for the rook on g1 if needed\n\n5. Other moves:\n   - f2g1 allows Qh4xg3 with a strong attack\n   - f2f1 is safer but still leaves the king exposed to future attacks\n\nThe best move is clearly g2g3 as it prevents immediate mate and doesn't worsen White's position.\n\n```\ng2g3\n```"
