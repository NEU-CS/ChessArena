When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on d5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's rook on e4 is very active\n- Black has a knight on h4 attacking g2\n- Black's queen on c5 is eyeing the b4 square\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5c7: Forking rook and bishop, but after ...Qxc7 White doesn't gain much\n- e4e5: Pushing the pawn to attack the bishop, but Black can play ...Bxe5\n- f3g4: Blocking the knight's attack on g2, but allows ...Qxg4\n- d5d6: Advancing the passed pawn, but Black can blockade with ...Rd8\n- e4g4: Trading rooks when we're ahead in the endgame\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4g4:\n- Forces the trade of active rooks\n- After Rxg4 Nxg4, White's bishop pair vs Black's knight\n- White can then push the d-pawn with better chances\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow Black counterplay. The rook trade leads to a favorable endgame where our passed d-pawn becomes decisive.\n\n```\ne4g4\n```"
