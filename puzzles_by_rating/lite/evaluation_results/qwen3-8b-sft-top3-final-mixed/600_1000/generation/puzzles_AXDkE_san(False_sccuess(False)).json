When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on d6 controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4\n- White's rook on b1 is very active\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rb6+ next move, winning the bishop on c8\n- White could also play Bxd5, winning a piece\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Rook lift to h8 to potentially attack the h2 pawn\n- c8d7: Blocking the b1 rook's path to d7\n- f6e7: Moving the king to safety\n- d5e7: Knight move attacking the rook on e1\n\nAfter considering these options, c8d7 seems most important to prevent Rb6+ winning the bishop. Other moves either don't address the immediate threats or leave the king exposed.\n\nThe best move is:\n```\nc8d7\n```"
