When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized queen on e4 and bishop on c4\n3. Black's king is exposed on e7 with limited pawn cover\n4. White has potential threats like Qe4-e7+ or Bc4-d5+\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the king safety issue\n- Need to challenge White's central control\n- Need to activate Black's pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e7e8 - Gets the king to slightly safer square but still exposed\n2. d8d7 - Connects rooks but allows Qe4-e7+ winning the bishop\n3. c8c7 - Develops the bishop but doesn't solve king safety\n4. c6e5 - Interesting, challenges White's center and opens lines\n5. e7f7 - Moves king towards relative safety\n\nAfter considering these:\n- c6e5 looks tempting but after fxe5, White's pieces become more active\n- e7f7 is solid but passive\n- d8d7 is dangerous due to Qe7+\n- c8c7 is too slow\n\nThe best move appears to be e7f7, getting the king to slightly safer square while keeping options to bring the rook to f8 later. It's the most prudent choice in this position.\n\n```\ne7f7\n```"
