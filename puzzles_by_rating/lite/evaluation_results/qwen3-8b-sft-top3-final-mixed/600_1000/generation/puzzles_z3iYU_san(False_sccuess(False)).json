When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, queen, bishop, knight vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight). \n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on f4 attacking Black's bishop on d6\n- Black's king is exposed on g7 with limited pawn cover\n- White has pressure on the h-file with rook on h1 and queen on d3 eyeing h7\n- Black's rook on h8 is under attack from White's bishop on g7\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- White could play Bxh8 winning the rook\n- White could play Qxh7+ winning the pawn and exposing Black's king\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 - defends against Bxh8 but leaves h7 pawn hanging\n- f7g8 - blocks the h-file but looks awkward\n- d8g5 - develops queen with tempo against the knight\n- f5h6 - moves the knight to safety while attacking g4\n- d6f8 - moves bishop to safety while defending h6\n\nAfter considering these options, d8g5 seems most promising because:\n- It develops the queen actively\n- It attacks the knight on f4, forcing it to move or be defended\n- It maintains control over h7 square\n- It keeps options open for future play\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or create new weaknesses. For example, moving the rook (h8g8) leaves h7 vulnerable, and moving the bishop (d6f8) blocks the queen's activity.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nd8g5\n```"
