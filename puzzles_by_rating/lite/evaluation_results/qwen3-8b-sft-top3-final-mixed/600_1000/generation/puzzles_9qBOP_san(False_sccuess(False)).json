When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, and pawns)\n2. White has a strong centralized rook on e5 and bishop on b3\n3. Black's queen is active on f6 but potentially exposed\n4. Black's king is somewhat exposed with limited pawn cover\n5. White has threats like Qd1-d5 or Rd1-d5 targeting the d5 pawn\n\nKey observations:\n- White's rook on e5 is very strong and needs to be challenged\n- Black's queen is under some pressure from White's pieces\n- The f5 bishop is well-placed but could be more active\n- Black needs to improve king safety\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. f6e6 - Blocking the rook's influence and defending d5\n2. f5g6 - Developing the bishop to a more active diagonal\n3. f8e8 - Connecting rooks and getting the king to safety\n4. f6h6 - Moving the queen to a safer square\n\nAfter considering:\n- f6e6 looks tempting but after Rxe6 Bxe6, White's bishop pair becomes strong\n- f5g6 is interesting but doesn't address the immediate rook pressure\n- f8e8 is solid but passive\n- f6h6 is safe but gives up the strong f6 square\n\nThe best move appears to be f6e6, challenging the rook immediately. Even though it leads to an exchange, it's better than letting White maintain the strong rook on e5. After Rxe6 Bxe6, Black can play ...Qxe6 and the position remains balanced.\n\n```\nf6e6\n```"
