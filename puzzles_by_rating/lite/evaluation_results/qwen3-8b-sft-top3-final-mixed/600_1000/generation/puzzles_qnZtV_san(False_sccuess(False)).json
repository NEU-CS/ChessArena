When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop vs Black's queen, rook, bishop. Material is equal, but White has a passed pawn on b3 that could become dangerous.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g7 with White's queen and bishop eyeing it. White's king is relatively safe on c1.\n\n3. Key threats: Black's queen on d6 is very active, eyeing the b4 pawn and potentially threatening Qxb4. White needs to address this while maintaining pressure.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3e8: Queen sacrifice to win the rook, but after ...Qxe8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- e3h6: Threatening mate on g7, but Black can defend with ...Qxh6\n- e3e6: Centralizing the queen while attacking the d6 queen\n- c1c2: Developing the rook to support the b-pawn\n- b1c2: Developing the bishop to support the b-pawn\n\nAfter considering these options, e3e6 seems strongest because:\n- It attacks Black's active queen\n- Maintains pressure on g7\n- Keeps options open for both queen and rook\n- If Black moves the queen, White can follow up with Qxg6 or other threats\n- It's more flexible than e3h6 which can be easily defended\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen's activity or miss the initiative.\n\n```\ne3e6\n```"
