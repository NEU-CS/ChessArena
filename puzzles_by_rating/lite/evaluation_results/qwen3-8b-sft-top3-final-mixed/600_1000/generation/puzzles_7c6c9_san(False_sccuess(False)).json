When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White's queen on d3 is very active, eyeing the b5 square and potentially threatening Qxb5\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated - the rook on f8 is passive, and the bishop on e7 is blocked by pawns\n\nKey threats/considerations:\n- White could play Qxb5 next move if we don't address it\n- The knight on g5 is a major nuisance\n- We need to activate our pieces and find counterplay\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d8a5 - Attacks the queen and defends b5, but allows Nxe6+\n2. c8b8 - Develops the bishop but doesn't address immediate threats\n3. d5f4 - Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n4. e7g5 - Captures the annoying knight but opens the e-file\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- d5f4 looks most promising as it:\n  - Centralizes the knight\n  - Attacks the queen\n  - Prepares potential ...Nxd3 winning the queen\n  - Maintains control over key squares\n\nThe move also forces White to deal with the threat to their queen while we improve our piece coordination.\n\n```\nd5f4\n```"
