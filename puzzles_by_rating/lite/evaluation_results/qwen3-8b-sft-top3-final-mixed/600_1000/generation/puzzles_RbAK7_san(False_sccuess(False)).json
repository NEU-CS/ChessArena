When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black has a passed pawn on b2 that's about to promote.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's b2 pawn is one move away from promotion\n- White's knight on h4 is attacking Black's bishop on e4\n- Black's rook on e8 is currently passive\n- White's king is exposed on d2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b1q (promoting immediately)\n- e4f3 (bishop sacrifice to open up White's king)\n- e8g8 (rook lift to potentially attack along the g-file)\n- f6g5 (bishop move to defend the e4 bishop)\n\n4. Analysis of b2b1q:\n- After b2b1q, White can play Rxb1\n- Then Black can play Bxh4, winning the knight\n- But White's rook would be active and Black's king is exposed\n\n5. Analysis of e4f3:\n- After e4f3, White must take with Kxf3\n- Then Black plays b2b1q, and after Rxb1, Bxh4 wins the knight\n- Black is up a bishop and pawn with a winning position\n\n6. Other moves don't seem as forcing or don't lead to immediate advantages.\n\nThe bishop sacrifice e4f3 leads to a clearly winning position where Black will be up material after the sequence. This is the most forcing and decisive continuation.\n\n```\ne4f3\n```"
