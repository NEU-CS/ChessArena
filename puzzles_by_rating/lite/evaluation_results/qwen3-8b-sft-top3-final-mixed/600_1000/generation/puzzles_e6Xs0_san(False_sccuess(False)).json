When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, and pawns. Black is up in material but White has some counterplay.\n\n2. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on e1 is attacking White's rook on e4\n- Black's rook on c2 is attacking White's pawn on a5\n- Black's pawn on g5 is threatening to promote if not stopped\n\n3. King safety:\n- White's king is exposed on g3\n- Black's king is relatively safe on f7\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4e8: Rook sacrifice to eliminate Black's queen, but after Qxe8 White's position remains difficult\n- e4e7: Blocking the queen's attack while attacking the f7 king, but Black can play Qxe7\n- e4e6: Blocking the queen's attack while attacking the g5 pawn, but Black can play Qxe6\n- a5a6: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn, but Black can simply take it with Rxa6\n- g3g4: Moving the king away from potential checks, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n5. Best move seems to be e4e7:\n- It blocks the queen's attack on the rook\n- It attacks the black king, forcing it to move\n- After Qxe7, White can play a5a6 creating a passed pawn\n- The position remains complicated but White gets some counterplay\n\nOther moves either lose material immediately or don't address the threats. While e4e7 leads to complications, it's the most active defense with some counterplay chances.\n\n```\ne4e7\n```"
