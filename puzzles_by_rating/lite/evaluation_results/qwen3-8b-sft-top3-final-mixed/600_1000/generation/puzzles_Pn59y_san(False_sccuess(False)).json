When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, knight, queen and pawns vs Black's rook, queen and pawns. White is up a minor piece.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on e7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen on g4 is eyeing the g7 pawn which is only defended by the rook on f8\n- Black's queen on a5 is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7g8: Forking king and rook, but after ...Qxg8 White doesn't have immediate follow-up\n- e7c8: Attacking the rook, but Black can just move it\n- g4g7: Capturing the pawn with check, but after ...Rxg7 White's attack fizzles out\n- g4d7: Pinning the rook to the king, but Black can defend with ...Qd8\n- b7b8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, but not immediately threatening\n\n4. Best move appears to be e7g8:\n- It's a knight fork attacking both king and rook\n- After ...Qxg8, White can play Qxg8+ Kxg8 and then Rxf8 winning the exchange\n- Even if Black tries ...Kxg8, White has Qxg8+ Kxg8 and Rxf8 with a clear material advantage\n- Other moves either don't win material or allow Black to defend\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ne7g8\n```"
