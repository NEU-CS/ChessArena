When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook, bishop, and pawns vs White's rook, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on d6 that's very active\n- Black's rook on e5 is under attack by White's pawn on g4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on h8\n- White has a passed pawn on g4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5e8: Trading rooks when we're behind in development\n- e5h5: Moving the rook to safety while attacking the g4 pawn\n- b5e8: Bishop retreat to defend the rook\n- h8g8: King move to safer square\n\n4. Best options:\n- e5h5 looks tempting as it defends the rook and attacks the g4 pawn\n- However, after Rxh5, White gets a strong passed pawn\n- b5e8 is solid, defending the rook while keeping the bishop active\n- h8g8 is safe but passive\n\nAfter considering these, b5e8 seems most principled:\n- It defends the rook while keeping the bishop active\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Keeps options open for future play\n\nThe move also prevents White from playing moves like Rxe5 in some lines.\n\n```\nb5e8\n```"
