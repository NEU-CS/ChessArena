Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on d6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's rook on h6 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e3 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h8: Rook lift to threaten the 8th rank\n- e4f6: Knight fork attacking king and rook\n- e4d6: Knight takes pawn, but allows ...Rxd6\n- f3f4: Pushing the pawn to create threats\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- h6h8 looks tempting, but after ...Rd8 the rook might get trapped\n- e4f6+ is very strong: after Kxf6, Rh6+ wins the rook on d8\n- e4f6+ Kxf6 Rh6+ Ke7 (only move) Rxd8 and White is winning\n- Other knight moves don't create immediate threats\n\nThe knight fork e4f6+ is the most forcing and decisive move, winning material immediately.\n\n```\ne4f6\n```"

It also puts pressure on the back rank and forces Black to react.\n\nAfter `h6h8`, Black must respond to the threat of `d7d8=Q`. This gives White a decisive advantage.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n\n```\nh6h8\n```"
