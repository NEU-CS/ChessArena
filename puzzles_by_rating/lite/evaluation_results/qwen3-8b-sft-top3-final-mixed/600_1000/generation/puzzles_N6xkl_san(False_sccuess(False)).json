When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs Black's rook, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on f7 is very active, attacking the black king on c8\n- Black's queen on g5 is threatening White's king\n- White's queen on e2 is defending against the queen threat\n- Black has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h3\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black's queen is attacking White's king (Qxh2#)\n- White needs to address this while maintaining the initiative\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e2h5: Blocks the queen's path to h2 while attacking the queen\n- e2g4: Also blocks the queen's path to h2\n- f7f8: Rook check, but after ...Kd8 the queen can still take h2\n- e5g7: Bishop move, but doesn't address the immediate threat\n\n5. Best move seems to be e2h5:\n- Blocks the queen's path to h2\n- Attacks the queen\n- If queen moves, White can play Rf8+ winning the queen\n- If queen takes h5, then Rf8+ Kd8 Qxg5 and White is winning\n\nOther moves either don't address the threat or lose material. e2h5 is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\ne2h5\n```"
