When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Knight, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Bishop, Knight, Queen, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on h3, threatening mate on g2\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a knight on g4 attacking f2 and h2\n- White has a knight on b6 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Available moves:\n- g1f2: Moves king towards center but into potential discovered checks\n- g1h1: Moves king to corner, but might be safer from immediate threats\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black's queen on h3 is the biggest immediate threat\n- After g1h1, Black could play Qxh2+ winning a pawn\n- After g1f2, Black could play Qf3+ with strong pressure\n\n5. Best defense:\n- g1h1 seems more resilient as it:\n  - Gets the king away from the dangerous g-file\n  - Prepares to bring the rook to g1 to defend h2\n  - Limits Black's immediate attacking options\n\nWhile neither move is perfect, g1h1 appears to be the more resilient choice that maintains some defensive resources.\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
