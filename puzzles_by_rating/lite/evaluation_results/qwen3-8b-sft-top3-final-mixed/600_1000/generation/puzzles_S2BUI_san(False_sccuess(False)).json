When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, bishop, pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b6 is extremely powerful, attacking multiple squares near Black's king\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover\n- Black has a rook on d8 and another on e1, both potentially active\n- White's bishop on g2 is blocked by its own pawn on g4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: b6b8 looks tempting as it checks the king and forces it to g7, but after ...Kg7 we don't have immediate follow-up\n- b6c7 attacks the rook on d8 and threatens mate on h7, but Black can defend with ...Rd7\n- b6g6+ forces the king to h7, but then what? Not immediately decisive\n- Bishop moves: g2e4 looks interesting to activate the bishop\n- Pawn moves: g4g5 could be considered to open lines\n\n4. Best move seems to be b6c7:\n- Attacks the rook on d8\n- Threatens mate on h7 (Qh7#)\n- If Black plays ...Rd7, we can play Qxd7+ Rxd7 and then Bxd7 winning material\n- If Black doesn't defend the rook, we take it and have a strong attack\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. b6c7 maintains maximum pressure while creating concrete threats.\n\n```\nb6c7\n```"
