When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (White has knight, bishop, queen vs Black's rook, bishop, queen). \n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a strong knight on h3 attacking White's pawn on g2\n- White's king is exposed on f1\n- Black's queen on d7 is eyeing the b5 square\n- White's bishop on b3 is blocked by its own pawn on c3\n\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Black's knight fork on h3, which would win the g2 pawn\n- Black could also play ...Qxb5 winning a pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3h5: Attacks the bishop on e6 but allows ...Nxg2\n- c2g6: Pins the bishop to the king, but Black can play ...Qxg6\n- e1e6: Interesting sacrifice to remove the strong bishop\n- f2f4: Defends g2 but weakens the king position\n- c3c4: Opens the bishop but allows ...Qxb5\n\n5. Best move seems to be e1e6:\n- Sacrifices the rook for the bishop pair\n- After ...fxe6, White can play Qd5+ winning the bishop on e6\n- This leads to a favorable endgame with White's pieces more active\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or lead to worse positions. The rook sacrifice is the most forcing and advantageous continuation.\n\n```\ne1e6\n```"
