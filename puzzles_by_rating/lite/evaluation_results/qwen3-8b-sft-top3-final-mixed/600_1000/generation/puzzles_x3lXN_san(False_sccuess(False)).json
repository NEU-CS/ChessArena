When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a strong bishop on h2 pinning White's pawn on g2 to the king\n- Black's queen and rook are very active on the e-file\n- White's king is exposed and under pressure\n- White has a passed pawn on b5 but it's blockaded by Black's pawn on c6\n\n3. Available moves:\n- g1h1: Moves the king away from the pin but into a more exposed position\n- g1f1: Moves the king towards the corner but still leaves the pin on g2\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black has potential threats like ...Qe1+ or ...Rf8 with ideas of ...Qe1+\n- The bishop on h2 is very dangerous as it can deliver checks\n\n5. Best defense:\n- g1f1 seems slightly better as it:\n  - Gets the king away from the immediate danger on the g-file\n  - Keeps the king closer to the corner where it's slightly safer\n  - Doesn't allow any immediate discovered attacks\n\nAfter careful consideration, the better move is:\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"
