When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong pawn center with pawns on d4, e5, f5\n3. Black's king is exposed in the center (e8)\n4. White has pressure on the e-file with rook on e1 and queen on e2\n5. Black's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated\n\nKey observations:\n- White's pawn on f5 is very strong and cramping Black's position\n- Black needs to address the immediate threats while improving piece coordination\n- The e-file is a major concern for Black's king safety\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e8f8 - Gets the king off the e-file but leaves it exposed on f8\n2. e8f7 - More active king move, but still exposed\n3. e7f6 - Blocks the f-pawn but allows Bxf6\n4. g8f6 - Develops the knight and blocks the f-pawn\n5. d8c8 - Moves the queen to safety but doesn't address immediate threats\n\nAfter considering these:\n- g8f6 seems most principled as it blocks the strong f-pawn and develops a piece\n- e8f7 is also interesting but leaves the king exposed\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threats or worsen the position\n\nThe best move appears to be g8f6, which:\n- Blocks the dangerous f5 pawn\n- Develops the knight to a more active square\n- Maintains control over key central squares\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\n```\ng8f6\n```"
