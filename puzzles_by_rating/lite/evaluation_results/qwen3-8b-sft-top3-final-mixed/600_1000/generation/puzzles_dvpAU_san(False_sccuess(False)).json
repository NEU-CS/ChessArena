When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on g4 is eyeing the g6 pawn and could potentially create mating threats\n- White's rook on b7 is very active and could potentially swing to the kingside\n- White's bishop on d2 is controlling important diagonals\n\n3. Black's defensive needs:\n- Need to protect the g6 pawn which is under attack from the queen\n- Need to prevent White's rook from becoming more active\n- Need to maintain coordination between pieces\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h6: Blocks the queen's attack on g6 and develops the knight\n- f7f6: Creates a luft for the king and protects g6\n- c5e7: Blocks the queen's diagonal and defends f6\n- g6g5: Pushes the pawn but weakens the kingside\n\nAfter considering these options, g8h6 seems most promising because:\n- It directly blocks the queen's attack on g6\n- Develops the knight to a more active square\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses like f7f6 might\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. For example, f7f6 would weaken the kingside pawn structure, and c5e7 would block the knight's potential activity.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng8h6\n```"
