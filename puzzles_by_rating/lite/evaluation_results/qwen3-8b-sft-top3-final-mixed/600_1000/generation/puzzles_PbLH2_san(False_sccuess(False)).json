When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong knight on c6 that's very active and threatening\n3. Black's king is still in the center, which is dangerous\n4. White's queen on e2 is eyeing the f7 square (a common weakness)\n5. Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by pawns and not very active\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the immediate threat of Nxd8 winning the queen\n- Need to develop pieces and get the king to safety\n- Need to deal with the strong white knight on c6\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. c7d8 - This seems forced to save the queen, but after Nxd8 Qxd8, White has Bb5+ winning the queen back\n2. f8d6 - Developing the bishop while defending d8, but White can still play Nxd8 Qxd8 Bb5+ winning the queen\n3. e8d7 - King move to safety, but allows Nxd8 Qxd8 Bb5+ winning the queen\n4. c8d7 - Blocking the bishop's diagonal while defending d8, but again Bb5+ wins the queen\n5. f6d5 - Counterattacking the knight, but after exd5 Qxd8, White has Bb5+ winning the queen\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move appears to be c7d8, even though it loses the queen to Bb5+, because:\n- It's the only way to save the queen immediately\n- After Nxd8 Qxd8 Bb5+ c6, Black can play Qd7 and the position remains playable\n- Other moves either lose the queen or lead to worse positions\n\n```\nc7d8\n```"
