When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. White has a strong centralized queen on e4 and bishop on d3\n3. Black's king is exposed with limited pawn cover\n4. White has a passed pawn on b5 that could become dangerous\n5. Black's queen on c5 is under attack by White's bishop on d3\n\nKey observations:\n- White threatens to win the queen with Bxc5\n- Black needs to address this immediate threat while maintaining counterplay\n- The queen must move, but where?\n- Moving to e5 looks tempting but allows Bxe5 Nxe5 and White has strong pressure\n- Moving to d6 blocks the d-pawn but allows Bxc5 anyway\n- Moving to h5/g5 seems passive\n- Moving to f5 looks interesting as it maintains pressure on e4\n\nAfter considering these options, the best move appears to be Qf5 because:\n1. It maintains pressure on White's queen\n2. It keeps the queen active and centralized\n3. It prevents Bxc5 as the bishop can't take due to Qxe4+\n4. It maintains potential for counterplay against White's king\n\nOther moves either lose material or give up the initiative. While Qf5 does allow some tactical possibilities for White, it's the most resilient option.\n\n```\nc5f5\n```"
