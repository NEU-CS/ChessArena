When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance and piece placement:\n- Black has a rook on a8, queen on d8, knight on e7, pawns on a7, b7, c7, g7, h7\n- White has a rook on a1, bishop on e6, knight on d5, pawns on a2, b2, c2, e4, g2, h2\n- Black's king is on c6 (very exposed!)\n- White's king is on e1 (castled position)\n\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is in serious danger on c6\n- White's bishop on e6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's knight on d5 is well placed\n- Black's queen and rook are not coordinated yet\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c6d6: King moves towards center but still exposed\n- c6b6: King moves towards corner but away from danger\n- c6b5: King moves towards edge but still vulnerable\n- d8d5: Queen takes knight, but after Bxd5 Kxd5, White has strong pressure\n- e7d5: Knight takes knight, but after exd5, White's bishop remains strong\n\n4. Best option:\n- e7d5 seems most principled:\n  - Removes the strong knight\n  - Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n  - After exd5, Black can play ...Qxd5 with some counterplay\n  - Other king moves leave Black in a very passive position\n\n5. Why not other moves:\n- King moves all leave Black's position very passive\n- d8d5 allows White to maintain strong pressure after Bxd5\n- e7d5 is the only move that creates some counterplay\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7d5\n```"
