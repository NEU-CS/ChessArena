When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have minor pieces and rooks)\n2. White has a strong bishop on g5 pinning the knight on e5 to the king\n3. Black's king is exposed on c8 with limited pawn cover\n4. White has pressure on the e5 knight which is currently defended by the rook on f8\n5. Black's rook on f8 is tied to defending the knight\n\nKey considerations:\n- The knight on e5 is under attack and needs to be moved or defended\n- The pin on the knight is dangerous - moving it could lead to material loss\n- We need to address the immediate threats while maintaining our position\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e5f7 - moves the knight but leaves it hanging to the bishop\n2. e5d7 - moves the knight but blocks the d-pawn\n3. e5g6 - moves the knight but allows Bxg6\n4. f8f7 - defends the knight but blocks the f-pawn\n5. f8e8 - defends the knight while keeping the rook active\n\nAfter considering these options, f8e8 seems best because:\n- It defends the knight while keeping the rook active\n- It maintains control of the e-file\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- It prepares potential doubling of rooks on the e-file\n\nOther moves either lose material or create positional weaknesses. The pin is still a problem, but defending the knight is more urgent than trying to break the pin immediately.\n\n```\nf8e8\n```"
