When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. White has a strong centralized queen on d4 and active pieces\n3. Black's king is still in the center (not castled yet)\n4. Black's dark-squared bishop on g4 is very active but potentially loose\n5. White has a passed pawn on b4 that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- White's queen on d4 is very strong and needs to be addressed\n- Black's king safety is a concern\n- The bishop on g4 is under attack by White's pawn on f3\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g4h5 - Retreating the bishop but allows Qxh5\n2. g4f5 - Bishop takes pawn, but after exf5 White gets open e-file\n3. d8e7 - Queen moves to defend e6 bishop and connect rooks\n4. d8f6 - Queen moves to attack f3 pawn and defend bishop\n5. f8e8 - Rook moves to connect with other rook\n\nAfter considering these:\n- d8f6 seems most promising as it:\n  * Defends the bishop on g4\n  * Attacks the f3 pawn\n  * Prepares to castle kingside\n  * Maintains control over d4 square\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. For example, moving the bishop would lose it after Qxh5, and other queen moves don't solve all problems.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd8f6\n```"
