When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a slight material advantage with an extra pawn (7 pawns vs 6), but Black has active pieces and threats.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- Black's queen on g4 is eyeing the g2 pawn and could potentially deliver checks\n- Black's bishop on h3 is pinning the f1 rook to the king\n- Black's rook on f7 is very active\n\n3. White's opportunities:\n- The knight on g5 has several attacking options\n- The bishop on d5 is very strong, controlling key diagonals\n- The queen on d2 can become more active\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h7: Forking king and rook, but after ...Kxh7 the knight is lost\n- g5f7: Capturing the rook, but after ...Qxf7 White loses the knight\n- d5b7: Attacking the rook, but Black can defend with ...Rxb7\n- d5e6: Blocking the queen's attack on g2 while maintaining pressure\n- f1h1: Getting out of the pin, but passive\n\n5. Best move seems to be d5e6:\n- Blocks the queen's attack on g2\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Prevents Black from playing ...Qxg2+\n- Keeps the bishop active\n- After ...fxe6, White can recapture with the knight with tempo (Nxe6+)\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. d5e6 is the most solid and active choice.\n\n```\nd5e6\n```"
