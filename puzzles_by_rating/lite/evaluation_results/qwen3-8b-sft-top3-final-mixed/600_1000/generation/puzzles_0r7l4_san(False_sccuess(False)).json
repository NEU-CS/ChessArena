When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a strong centralized rook on e3 and bishop on b3\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- Black's rook on c8 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White has potential threats against Black's king\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qe2+ next move, forcing the king to move\n- White's rook on e3 could swing to e7 or e5 with threats\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- King moves: f7g8 or f7f8 to get away from potential checks\n- Rook moves: c8g8 to connect rooks and defend the king\n- Bishop moves: e6d7 to block potential queen checks\n\nAfter considering these options, the most pressing concern is king safety. Moving the king to g8 seems best because:\n- It gets away from the e-file where White's rook is active\n- It connects the rooks\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It prevents potential back rank issues\n\nOther options like c8g8 are also reasonable, but moving the king first seems more urgent given the immediate threats.\n\n```\nf7g8\n```"
