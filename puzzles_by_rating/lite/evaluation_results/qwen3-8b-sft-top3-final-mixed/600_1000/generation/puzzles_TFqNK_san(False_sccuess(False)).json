When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black's king is exposed on e7 with limited pawn cover\n3. White has a strong bishop on g5 pinning the f6 pawn to the king\n4. White's queen on h5 is very active and threatening\n5. Black's queen on f8 is awkwardly placed, blocking the rook on h8\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's king is vulnerable to checks\n- White has several ways to deliver checks or create threats\n- The most forcing moves are checks that maintain the initiative\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. h5e8 - Queen takes rook with check, but after Kxe8 we lose our active queen\n2. h5f7 - Queen check that forks king and rook, but after Kxf7 we lose the queen\n3. h5h7 - Queen check that looks strong, but after Kf8 we don't have a follow-up\n4. g5h6 - Bishop check that forces the king to move, but not immediately decisive\n5. h5f3 - Queen check that maintains pressure while keeping the queen active\n\nThe best move appears to be h5f3, which:\n- Delivers a check\n- Keeps the queen active and centralized\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- Doesn't allow Black to easily escape the initiative\n\nAfter h5f3, Black has limited good moves:\n- If Kd8, then Qf7+ wins the rook\n- If Ke8, then Qf7+ wins the rook\n- Other king moves allow White to maintain pressure\n\n```\nh5f3\n```"
