When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (rook + rook \u2248 queen).\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on c7\n- White's rooks are doubled on the e-file\n- Black's king is exposed on h7\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has connected passed pawns on the queenside (b4, d5, d6)\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play Qc2+ next move, attacking the rook on e3 and threatening mate\n- Black's pawns are dangerous and could promote if not stopped\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e3e8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, but allows Qc2+\n- e3e7: Blocks the queen's path to c2, but allows Qxe7\n- f3g3: Defends against Qc2+ but doesn't address other threats\n- g4g5: Pushes the pawn but doesn't solve immediate problems\n- b2b3: Stops the b4 pawn but allows Qc2+\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is e3e7, blocking the queen's path to c2 while maintaining material equality. Although it loses the rook, it prevents immediate threats and keeps the game balanced.\n\n```\ne3e7\n```"
