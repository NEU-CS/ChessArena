When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a rook on e2 attacking White's pawn on g2\n- White's queen is very active on g5\n- Black's king is exposed on a8\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: g5g8 looks tempting as it checks the king and threatens mate\n- Rook moves: a1g1 to defend g2 pawn\n- Pawn moves: g2g3 to defend against the rook attack\n\n4. Calculating g5g8+:\n- After g5g8+ kxg8, White can play a1g1 pinning the rook to the king\n- Black might play ...Rg2 instead, but then Qxg2 Kxg2 and White has a winning endgame\n\n5. Other queen moves don't seem as forcing or don't create immediate threats.\n\n6. The immediate g5g8+ seems strongest as it forces the king to take and leads to a favorable endgame.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5g8\n```"
