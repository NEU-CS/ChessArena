When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White's king is somewhat exposed on f1\n4. Black's bishop on e7 is pointing at White's kingside\n5. White has a passed pawn on g3 that could become dangerous\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's knight on d4 is a major threat - it's attacking White's queen and rook\n- White needs to deal with this threat while maintaining initiative\n- The move e2e6 looks tempting to attack the bishop, but after ...fxe6 White's queen is still under pressure\n- The move c3d5 forks the queen and bishop, but after ...exd5 White's queen remains under attack\n- The move d1d4 seems most forcing - it trades queens and removes the immediate threat\n\nAfter d1d4:\n- If ...Qxd4, then c3xd4 and White has eliminated the dangerous knight\n- If ...exd4, then Qxd4 and White is fine\n- Black might play ...Qxd4 first, but then c3xd4 and White is better\n\nOther candidate moves like e2e5 or e2h5 don't address the immediate threat to the queen and rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd1d4\n```"
