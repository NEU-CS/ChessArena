When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black has a strong knight on h5 eyeing f4 and g3 squares\n3. White's king is somewhat exposed on h1\n4. Black's queen on e7 is very active, eyeing the h4 square\n5. White has a passed pawn on d3 that could become dangerous\n6. Black's knight on c6 is well placed, controlling key squares\n\nKey considerations:\n- Need to address the threat to h4 pawn (could be captured by Qxh4)\n- Need to improve king safety\n- Need to activate White's pieces\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. h2g4 - defends h4 but blocks the g-pawn and leaves h2 weak\n2. d2f2 - defends h4 indirectly by controlling f2, but seems passive\n3. a1g1 - brings rook to defend h1 and potentially attack h5 knight\n4. h1g1 - king moves to safer square but doesn't address other issues\n5. d3d4 - advances passed pawn but may be premature\n\nAfter considering these, a1g1 seems most promising because:\n- It defends against Qxh4 by covering h1\n- Prepares potential rook lift via g3\n- Puts pressure on Black's knight on h5\n- Keeps all options open for White\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\na1g1\n```"
