When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Bishop, Queen vs Black's Rook, Bishop, Queen. Material is equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g4 is very active and threatening\n- White's rook on a7 is very active and can potentially deliver checks\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black's queen is eyeing g2 and h1 squares\n- Black could play ...Qxg2+ winning the pawn\n- White needs to address this threat while maintaining initiative\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e3h6: Bishop checks the king, but after ...Kf8 the queen can still take g2\n- e2h5: Queen moves to h5, attacking the queen and defending g2\n- d1d8: Rook moves to d8, pinning the bishop to the king\n- a7a8: Rook moves to a8, but doesn't address the queen threat\n\nAfter considering these options, e2h5 seems strongest because:\n- It defends g2 against the queen threat\n- It attacks Black's queen\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It keeps the initiative\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or lose the initiative. For example, e3h6 looks tempting but after ...Kf8, Black's queen remains active.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne2h5\n```"
