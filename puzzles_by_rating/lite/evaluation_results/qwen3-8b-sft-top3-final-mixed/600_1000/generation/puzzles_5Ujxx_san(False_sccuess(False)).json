When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, queen, bishop, pawns vs White's rook, queen, knight, pawns). Black's king is slightly more exposed.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong knight on e4 and queen on e2 eyeing the f5 pawn\n- Black's bishop on d5 is very active, controlling important diagonals\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8) which could be dangerous\n- White has pressure on the f-file with rook on f1 and queen on e2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8g8 (castling) - gets the king to safety but allows White to play Qxf5\n- e8f8 - moves king towards safety but still leaves it exposed\n- e7f6 - defends the f5 pawn but blocks the bishop\n- d5e4 - trades the strong bishop for White's knight, but after Nxe4 Qxe4, White's queen becomes more active\n- f5e4 - pawn takes knight, but after Qxe4, White's queen is very active\n\n4. Best move seems to be e8g8 (castling):\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Connects the rooks\n- Prepares to bring the rook to f8 to defend f5\n- After Qxf5, Black can play Rf8 and the position remains balanced\n\nOther moves either leave the king exposed or give White too much activity. Castling is the most principled move here.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
