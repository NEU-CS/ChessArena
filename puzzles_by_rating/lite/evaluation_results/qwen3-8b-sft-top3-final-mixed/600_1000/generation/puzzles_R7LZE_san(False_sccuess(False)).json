When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

There may be some tactical ideas involving these two.\n- The black rook on e8 can potentially double on the e-file or move to a more active square.\n- The knight on f6 is well-placed, attacking e4 and g4.\n- The white knight on e6 is strong, but not currently under attack.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nFrom the list of legal moves, we can narrow down to the most promising ones:\n\n#### Rook on e8:\n- `e8h8`: Moving rook to h8 \u2014 possibly preparing to double rooks on the h-file or support a kingside attack.\n- `e8g8`: Similar idea, supporting a potential kingside initiative.\n- `e8f8`: Could help connect with the other rook or prepare for a central push.\n- `e8d8`: Connects with the queen on a4 via the d-file? Not sure yet.\n- `e8e7`: Defends the 7th rank, supports ...f5 or ...c4.\n\n#### Knight on f6:\n- `f6g8`: Retreats the knight \u2014 not ideal unless necessary.\n- `f6h7`: Attacks the g5 square, maybe useful in a kingside attack.\n- `f6d7`: Centralizes the knight, attacks e5 and c5.\n- `f6h5`: Attacks g3 and f4 \u2014 could be useful if White plays f4.\n- `f6d5`: Very active square, attacks c3 and e3.\n- `f6g4`: Attacks f2 \u2014 dangerous if White has weak pawns there.\n- `f6e4`: Forks queen and rook? Let's check: Qd3 vs Re4 \u2014 no fork, but Re4 attacks Qd3 and threatens to win material.\n\n#### Queen on a4:\n- `a4d7`: Attacks the knight on e6 \u2014 this is interesting.\n- `a4c6`: Also attacks the knight on e6.\n- `a4a6`, `a4a5`, `a4a3`, etc.: Moving queen along the a-file \u2014 not very active.\n- `a4h4`, `a4g4`, `a4f4`, etc.: Could be useful in a kingside attack.\n\n#### Pawns:\n- `b7b6`, `a7a6`, `h6h5`, `c5c4`, etc.: These are mostly prophylactic or preparatory moves.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Analysis:\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the most forcing and active move.\n\n### `a4d7` (Queen takes knight on e6)\nThis move:\n- Captures a strong white knight.\n- Removes a key attacker from the board.\n- Opens up the d-file for the rook on e8.\n- After `a4d7`, White must respond. If they recapture with the queen (`Qxd7`), then Black can play `Re1+` and win the queen.\n\nSo after:\n1. ... Qd7\n2. Qxd7 Rxd7\n\nNow Black has a rook on d7, and White\u2019s queen is gone. Black is up a piece and has a winning position.\n\nThis seems like a **clear tactical win**.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n```\na4d7\n```"
