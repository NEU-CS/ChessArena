When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop, queen, rook vs White's queen, rook, and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active, eyeing the g7 bishop and h7 pawn\n- Black's rook on d2 is deep in White's territory but potentially trapped\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg7 winning the bishop\n- White could also play Rg8+ forcing the king to move\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 - moves the king away from potential checks\n- g7f8 - blocks the queen's attack on the bishop while developing the bishop\n- d2d8 - tries to save the rook by moving it to the 8th rank\n- c7f7 - blocks the queen's diagonal\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- h8g8 seems passive and doesn't address the immediate threats\n- g7f8 looks interesting as it blocks the queen while developing the bishop\n- d2d8 is risky as the rook might still get trapped\n- c7f7 blocks the queen but leaves the bishop hanging\n\nThe best move appears to be g7f8, which:\n1. Blocks the queen's attack on the bishop\n2. Develops the bishop to a more active square\n3. Maintains control over key squares\n4. Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ng7f8\n```"
