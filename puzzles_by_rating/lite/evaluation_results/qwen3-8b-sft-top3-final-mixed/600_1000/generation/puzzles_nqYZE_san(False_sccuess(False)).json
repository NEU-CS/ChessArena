When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (Black has rook, bishop, queen vs White's rook, knight, queen). However, White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on d5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen on d4 is very active\n- Black's rook on e2 is pinning White's pawn on f2 to the king\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxf6 next move, winning the bishop\n- White could also play Qxh6, winning a pawn\n- White's rook on c1 is eyeing the c-file\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5h7: Bishop moves to h7, defending g6 and preparing to trade bishops\n- e2e1: Rook moves to e1, defending the king\n- f6g6: Queen moves to g6, defending h6 and g7\n- e8e7: King moves to e7, getting away from the open file\n\nAfter considering these options, the most pressing issue is defending against Qxf6. The move f5h7 seems best because:\n- It defends the g6 square against Qxh6\n- It maintains the bishop's activity\n- It prepares to trade bishops if White takes on f6\n- It doesn't block the king's escape squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nf5h7\n```"
