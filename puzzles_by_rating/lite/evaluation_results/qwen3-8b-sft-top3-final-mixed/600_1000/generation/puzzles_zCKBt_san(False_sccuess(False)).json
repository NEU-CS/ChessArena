When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

But that would be a blunder because after `...Rxd6`, White plays `Qxb7+` and wins material.\n\nSo capturing on d6 is bad.\n\n#### King on g8:\n- `g8h8`: Moving king to h8, getting off the open file.\n- `g8g7`: Centralizing the king slightly, but still exposed.\n- `g8g6`: Exposing king more, dangerous.\n\n#### Bishop on e7:\n- `e7d6`: Capturing the knight? Again, this seems tempting but leads to `Qxb7+` and loss of material.\n\n#### Queen on b2:\n- `b2b6`: Threatening the rook on a6 and possibly preparing to support a counterattack.\n- `b2b5`: Similar idea, less aggressive.\n- `b2b4`: Pressuring c3 and possibly supporting a pawn break.\n- `b2c3`: Forking rook and pawn, but c3 is defended.\n- `b2f2`: Threatening mate on f2, but White can defend with Re2 or Kg1.\n\n#### Knight on h6:\n- `h6f7`: Forking king and rook, but f7 is protected by the bishop.\n- `h6f5`: A quiet developing move.\n- `h6g4`: Attacking the rook on f2, but again, White can defend.\n\n#### Pawns:\n- `f6f5`: Breaking open the center, but weakens e6.\n- `a6a5`: Preparing to push b5, but slow.\n- `b7b6`: Supporting a potential ...b5 break.\n\n---\n\n## Best Move Evaluation:\n\nThe most critical issue is the **rook on d8 being attacked** and the **king being vulnerable**.\n\nA good plan is to **move the rook off the 8th rank** and **connect it with the other rook**, while keeping pressure on the center.\n\nBetween `d8e8` and `d8c8`, both are reasonable, but `d8e8` keeps the rook closer to the king and prepares for potential counterplay along the e-file.\n\nAlso, note that after `d8e8`, if White plays `Qxb7`, then `Re8` supports `...Bxd6` and recaptures material.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision:\n\n```\nd8e8\n```"
