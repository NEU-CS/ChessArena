When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on d6, while White's king is relatively safer on f2.\n\n3. Key threats:\n   - White's knight on g4 is attacking Black's pawn on f5\n   - White's rook on g1 could potentially check the Black king\n   - Black's pawn on f3 is threatening to promote\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - f7f8: Promoting the pawn to a queen seems tempting, but after Rxf8, Black loses the pawn\n   - e7g6: Blocking the knight's attack on f5 while developing the knight\n   - d6e6: Moving the king to a safer square\n   - b6b5: Advancing the pawn to create counterplay\n\nAfter considering these options, e7g6 seems most promising because:\n- It blocks the knight's attack on f5\n- It develops the knight to a more active square\n- It maintains the threat of the f3 pawn\n- It doesn't allow White any immediate counterplay\n\nOther moves either lose material (f7f8) or don't address the immediate threats (d6e6).\n\n```\ne7g6\n```"
