When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Queen (a4), Knight (e7), pawns (b3, e5, h2)\n   - Black has: Queen (f2), Rook (b6), pawns (a6, e6, f7, g7, h6)\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - White's queen on a4 is very active and threatening\n   - Black's king is exposed on g8\n   - White's knight on e7 is attacking f5 and g6 squares\n   - Black's queen on f2 is defending but could be in danger\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - g8h8: Moves king to corner, but allows Qh4+ winning the rook\n   - g8f8: Moves king towards center but into potential knight forks\n   - g8h7: Moves king towards the corner but away from immediate threats\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n   - g8h7 seems safest as it:\n     * Gets the king away from the h-file where White's queen can attack\n     * Avoids potential knight forks on f6 or g5\n     * Keeps the king near the corner where it's slightly safer\n   - The other moves either walk into tactics or leave the king more exposed\n\n5. After g8h7, Black can consider:\n   - Defending the rook with Qf2-f3\n   - Pushing passed pawns when possible\n   - Looking for counterplay against White's king\n\nThe safest and most prudent move is:\n\n```\ng8h7\n```"
