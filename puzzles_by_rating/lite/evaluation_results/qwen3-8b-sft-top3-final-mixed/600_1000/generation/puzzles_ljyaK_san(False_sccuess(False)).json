When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a very active queen on h4 attacking f2 and g2\n- Black's dark-squared bishop on g4 is pinning White's knight on g1 to the king\n- White's queen on a8 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n\n3. Threats:\n- Immediate threat is Black's queen taking g2 (Qxg2+) winning the bishop\n- Also Black could play ...Qxh2+ winning the rook\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g2b7: Blocking the queen's attack on g2 while developing the bishop\n- g1h3: Moving the knight to safety while attacking the bishop\n- a8e4: Queen sacrifice to expose Black's king\n- g2e4: Bishop sacrifice to open lines against Black's king\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g2b7 looks solid but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- g1h3 is risky as after ...Bxh3, White's position collapses\n- a8e4 is tempting but after ...Kxe4, White doesn't have enough compensation\n- g2e4! is the most promising, sacrificing the bishop to open Black's king\n\nThe best move is:\n```\ng2e4\n```"
