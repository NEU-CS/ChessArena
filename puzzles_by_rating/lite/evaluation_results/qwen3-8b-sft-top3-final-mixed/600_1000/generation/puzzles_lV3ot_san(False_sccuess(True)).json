When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and bishop vs White's rook. Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e3\n- Black's rook on a2 is very active, attacking the g2 pawn\n- Black's bishop on c6 is controlling important squares\n- White's rook on b6 is active but can be challenged\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Rb6-b3+ next move, forcing the king to move\n- White's f6 pawn is passed and dangerous if it advances\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a2a1: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- a2g2: Capturing the pawn with check, but after Kxg2 we lose material\n- c6e4: Bishop move attacking the king, but White can defend\n- h7h5: Pushing the pawn to create counterplay\n- d7d5: Opening the center to activate the bishop\n\nAfter considering these options, the most promising move appears to be a2g2, forcing the king to take and then we can play h7h5 with strong counterplay against White's king. Even though we lose the rook, we gain compensation through the passed h-pawn and active bishop.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\na2g2\n```"
