When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, queen, rook, and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen, and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- Black's queen on h4 is eyeing the h2 pawn\n- Black's rook on f4 is very active, pinning the f3 pawn (if it moves)\n- Black's bishop on e4 is very strong, controlling key squares\n\n3. White's opportunities:\n- The knight on c5 is very active and has several options\n- The queen on e3 can potentially join an attack\n- The rook on c1 is semi-active\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5d7: Forking king and rook, but after ...Kg7 the knight might be trapped\n- e3h6: Attacking the g7 pawn and threatening mate on h7\n- e3g5: Counterattacking the queen\n- c5e6: Forking bishop and pawn, but bishop can take\n- h1h2: Defending against Qxh2 threats\n\nAfter considering these options, e3h6 seems most promising because:\n- It attacks the g7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If ...gxh6, then Qxh6+ wins the rook on f4\n- If ...Qxh6, then Nxe4 wins a piece\n- It maintains pressure while defending against Black's threats\n\nOther moves either don't create enough threats or allow Black to consolidate. The immediate e3h6 seems most forcing and dangerous for Black.\n\n```\ne3h6\n```"
