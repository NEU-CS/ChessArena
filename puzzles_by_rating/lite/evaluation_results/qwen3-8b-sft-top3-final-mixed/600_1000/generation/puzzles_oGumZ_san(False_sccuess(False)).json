When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Knight, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White might be slightly better)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on d4, attacking f2 and e3\n- White's queen is on c6, potentially vulnerable\n- Black's bishop on b3 is pinning the f3 knight to the king\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g1h1: Moves king to corner, but still leaves it exposed to checks\n- g1f1: Moves king towards the rook, potentially safer\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Qxf2+ winning the pawn\n- Black could play ...Qe4+ forcing the king to move\n\nAfter considering both options, g1f1 seems slightly better because:\n- It moves the king towards relative safety behind the rook\n- It prevents immediate ...Qxf2+ as the pawn is now defended by the knight on b6\n- It keeps more options open for future defense\n\nThe move g1h1 would leave the king more exposed to potential checks along the h-file.\n\nTherefore, the better choice is:\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"
