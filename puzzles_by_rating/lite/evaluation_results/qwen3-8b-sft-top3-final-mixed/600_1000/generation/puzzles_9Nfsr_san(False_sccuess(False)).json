When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has a queen (d8), rook (g3), and pawns\n   - Black has a rook (e7), queen (e5), and pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - White's queen on d8 is very powerful, controlling the 8th rank\n   - Black's king is exposed on g7\n   - White's rook on g3 is attacking Black's pawn on h5\n   - Black's queen on e5 is under attack by White's rook\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - g7f7: King moves to f7 - but this walks into a potential discovered check from White's queen\n   - g7h6: King moves to h6 - this seems dangerous as it's moving towards the edge\n   - e5g5: Queen moves to g5 - this blocks the rook's attack on h5 but leaves the king exposed\n   - e5g3: Queen captures the rook on g3 - this seems most promising\n\n4. Evaluating e5g3:\n   - Captures White's active rook\n   - After Qxg3, White can play Qxe6+ winning the exchange (queen for rook)\n   - But this would leave Black with rook vs queen, which is still playable\n   - Other moves seem worse as they either expose the king or lose material\n\n5. Alternatives:\n   - g7f7 allows Qf8+ winning the queen\n   - g7h6 allows Qh8+ winning the queen\n   - e5g5 allows Qxg5 hxg5 and White's queen dominates\n\nAfter careful consideration, capturing the rook seems like the least bad option, as the other moves lead to immediate material loss or king exposure.\n\n```\ne5g3\n```"
