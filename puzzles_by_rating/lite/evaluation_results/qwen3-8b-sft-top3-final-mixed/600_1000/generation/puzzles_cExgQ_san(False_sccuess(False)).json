When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2, while Black's king is relatively safe on f8. Black has threats with the knight on g5 and pawn on g6.\n\n3. Immediate threats: Black's knight on g5 is attacking White's pawn on e4. If White doesn't defend it, Black can play Nxe4.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Defending the e4 pawn: g2f3 or d1e1\n- Activating the rook: d1d8 or d1d7\n- King safety: g2h3 or g2f2\n\n5. Best options:\n- g2f3 defends e4 but blocks the rook's file\n- d1e1 defends e4 while keeping rook active\n- d1d8 is tempting but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- g2h3 moves the king to safety but leaves e4 undefended\n\nThe most precise move is d1e1, which:\n- Defends the e4 pawn\n- Keeps the rook active on the open file\n- Doesn't block any pieces\n- Maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nd1e1\n```"
