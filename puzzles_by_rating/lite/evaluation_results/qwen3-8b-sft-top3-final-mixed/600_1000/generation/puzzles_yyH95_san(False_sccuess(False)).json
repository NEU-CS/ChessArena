When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has Rook, Rook, Queen vs Black's Rook, Rook, Queen\n- Material is equal, but White's pieces are more active\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h3 is very active, eyeing the g7 king\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a rook on b7 controlling the 7th rank\n- Black's rook on e8 is passive\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxg7# if given the chance\n- White's rooks could coordinate to create threats\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7g8: moves king away from danger but into a corner\n- g7f8: moves king towards center but still exposed\n- g7g6: moves king forward but into potential checks\n- e8e7: blocks the 7th rank but leaves king exposed\n- e6e7: trades rooks but leaves king exposed\n- e5c7: interesting, attacks the b7 rook\n\nAfter considering all options, e5c7 seems the most promising because:\n- It attacks the b7 rook which is defending the 7th rank\n- If White takes (Rxc7), we can recapture with Rxc7, improving our rook\n- It maintains some activity for our pieces\n- It doesn't leave the king in immediate danger like some other moves\n\nThe other moves either leave the king too exposed or don't improve our position.\n\n```\ne5c7\n```"
