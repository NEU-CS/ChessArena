When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Both sides have passed pawns, but White's pawns are more advanced.\n2. Black's king is actively placed in the center.\n3. White's king is also centralized but needs to decide whether to:\n   - Support the d-pawn's advance\n   - Try to stop Black's e-pawn\n   - Or go after Black's g-pawn\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. d5d6 - Advances the king towards Black's e-pawn, but allows Black's king to penetrate via e6\n2. d5c6 - Moves towards the d-pawn but leaves the e-pawn unattended\n3. d5c5 - Centralizes the king but doesn't make progress\n4. d5c4 - Moves away from the action\n5. d3d4 - Advances the d-pawn, creating a passed pawn\n\nBest move analysis:\n- d3d4 is very strong because:\n  * It creates an immediate passed pawn\n  * Black cannot stop both the d-pawn and g-pawn\n  * After d3d4, if Black takes exd4, then Kxd4 and White's king can support the g-pawn\n  * If Black doesn't take, White can push d5 next move\n\nOther moves either don't make progress or allow Black counterplay. The pawn push is decisive.\n\n```\nd3d4\n```"
