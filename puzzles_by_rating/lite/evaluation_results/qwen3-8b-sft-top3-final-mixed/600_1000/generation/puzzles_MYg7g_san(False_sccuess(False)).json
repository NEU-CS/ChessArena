When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, bishop, knight vs Black's queen, bishop, knight. Material is equal, but White has a passed e-pawn which could be dangerous.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on a7, while White's king is relatively safe on c1.\n\n3. Key features:\n   - Black's queen on g7 is very active\n   - White's queen on f4 is also active\n   - Black's bishop on e6 is strong, controlling the long diagonal\n   - White's bishop on d3 is blocked by its own pawn on c2\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - f4f8: Queen sacrifice to remove Black's queen, but after ...Kxf8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n   - f4g5: Attacking the bishop, but Black can defend with ...Qxg5\n   - e2d4: Centralizing the knight, but doesn't create immediate threats\n   - c1d2: King move to safety, but passive\n   - g3g4: Pushing the pawn to create threats against Black's king\n\nAfter considering these options, g3g4 seems most promising because:\n- It creates immediate threats against Black's king (g4-g5 ideas)\n- It opens lines for White's pieces\n- It prevents Black from castling (though Black's king is already exposed)\n- It maintains all of White's active pieces in play\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow Black to consolidate. The pawn push keeps the initiative.\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
