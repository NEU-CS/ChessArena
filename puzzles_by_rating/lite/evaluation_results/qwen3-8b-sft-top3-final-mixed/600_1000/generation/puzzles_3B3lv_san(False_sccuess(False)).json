When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on e5 is eyeing the b8 square, which could lead to mate threats if Black's king moves.\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous.\n\n3. Black's defensive needs:\n- The king is somewhat exposed on g8.\n- The rook on b1 is under attack from White's bishop on e3.\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b1b8: Defends against potential mate threats by keeping the rook active.\n- f5c8: Blocks the queen's path to b8 while developing the bishop.\n- g8f8: Moves the king to a safer square.\n\nAfter considering these options, b1b8 seems most prudent because:\n- It defends against any potential back rank mate threats.\n- It keeps the rook active and connected with the other rook.\n- It doesn't allow White to gain any immediate tactical advantages.\n- Other moves either leave the king exposed or don't address the immediate defensive needs.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nb1b8\n```"
