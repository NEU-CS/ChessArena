When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the material balance:\n   - White has: Rook, Rook, Queen, Knight, 2 pawns\n   - Black has: Rook, Queen, Bishop, 3 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n   - Black's king is exposed on g6\n   - White's queen on c5 is very active\n   - Black has a rook on h3 attacking White's pawn on h2\n   - White's knight on f6 is well placed but could be captured by Black's bishop on c6\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n   - h2g3: Moves the pawn to block the rook attack, but allows ...Qxh3 winning the pawn\n   - f2g3: Moves the pawn to block the rook attack while developing the pawn structure\n\n4. Evaluating f2g3:\n   - Blocks the rook attack on h2\n   - Creates a pawn chain that's harder to break\n   - Doesn't allow any immediate tactics for Black\n   - Maintains White's active piece play\n\n5. Evaluating h2g3:\n   - Blocks the rook but allows ...Qxh3\n   - After ...Qxh3, White would have to recapture with f2xh3, weakening the pawn structure\n   - This gives Black more counterplay\n\nThe better move is f2g3 as it maintains White's position without creating weaknesses. The pawn on f3 will be well protected by the rook on d1 and the knight on f6.\n\n```\nf2g3\n```"
