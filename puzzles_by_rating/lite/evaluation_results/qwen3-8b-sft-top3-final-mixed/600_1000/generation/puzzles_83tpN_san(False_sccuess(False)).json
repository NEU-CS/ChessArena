When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on e5\n- White's king is relatively safe on g5\n- Black has a passed pawn on h4 that could become dangerous\n- White's rook on h8 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Rook moves: The rook has many options, but we should look for threats or ways to improve its position\n- King moves: g5h6 looks interesting to approach the black king\n- Pawn moves: h3h4 would stop Black's passed pawn but gives up the h-pawn\n\n4. Critical considerations:\n- Black's knight on f6 is defending the h4 pawn\n- If we play h3h4, Black can simply take with the knight (Nxh4)\n- The rook can potentially check the black king from various squares\n\n5. Best move seems to be g5h6:\n- Brings the king closer to the action\n- Threatens to capture the knight on f6 (Kh6xg7 would be mate if the knight moves)\n- If Black moves the knight, we can bring the rook into play with checks\n- If Black pushes h4-h3, we can respond with h3xh3 and our king is well placed to stop the pawn\n\nOther moves like rook checks (h8e8+) allow Black to simply move the king away, while g5h6 creates more direct threats.\n\n```\ng5h6\n```"
