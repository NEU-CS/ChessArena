When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n   - Black has a queen on e5, knight on c6, and king on e8\n   - White has a bishop on f3 and queen on e2\n   - Black's king is still in the center and not castled\n   - White has castling rights (KQ) while Black has lost castling rights (kq)\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Black's queen is very active on e5\n   - White's bishop on f3 is pinning the knight on c6 to the king\n   - Black's king safety is a concern\n   - White has potential threats like Qd1+ or O-O-O\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e5f6: Queen takes bishop, but after Qxf6 White gets strong pressure\n   - e5e6: Queen moves forward, but doesn't solve king safety\n   - e8d8: King moves towards safety\n   - c6d8: Knight moves, but allows Qd1+ winning the knight\n   - e5h5: Queen retreats to safety while maintaining activity\n\n4. Best options seem to be:\n   - e5h5: Gets the queen to safety while keeping pressure\n   - e8d8: Improves king safety\n   - e5f4: Counterattacks the bishop while maintaining queen activity\n\nAfter considering these, e5h5 seems most prudent because:\n- It removes the queen from potential pins\n- Maintains queen activity on the h-file\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Keeps options open for future play\n\nThe other moves either leave the queen vulnerable or create new problems.\n\n```\ne5h5\n```"
