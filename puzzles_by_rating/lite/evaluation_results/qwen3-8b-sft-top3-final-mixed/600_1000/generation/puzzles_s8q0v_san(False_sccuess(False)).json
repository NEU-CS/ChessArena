When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Material is roughly equal (minor piece vs rook is about equal), but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g6 is eyeing the g2 pawn\n- Black's rook on e7 is controlling the e-file\n- White's knight on g5 is very active but potentially trapped\n- White's bishop on b3 is blocked by its own pawn on c2\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black could play Qxg2 next move if we don't defend\n- Black could also play Rxe2 winning the exchange\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Defending g2: Qd2-e2 or Qd2-f2\n- Moving the knight: Nge6 or Nf7\n- Developing the bishop: Bc4 or Bd5\n- Castling: O-O (but king is already castled)\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- Qe2 seems passive and allows Black to maintain pressure\n- Nge6 looks tempting but after ...Qxg2 we lose material\n- Bc4 develops the bishop but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- The best move appears to be Qf2, defending g2 while keeping the queen active\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nd2f2\n```"
