When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on g8 is attacking Black's rook on d8 and bishop on f8\n- Black's queen on a4 is eyeing White's pawn on b2\n- White's rook on h1 is not very active\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- Queen moves: g8h8 (check), g8f8 (captures bishop), g8g7 (safe)\n- Rook moves: h1g1 (connects rooks), h1f1 (defends f2)\n- Pawn moves: e5e6 (advances passed pawn)\n\n4. Best options:\n- g8f8 wins the bishop immediately (Qxf8+ Kxf8, then White can play Rhf1 with advantage)\n- g8h8+ forces the king to move (Kh7 or Ka7), but doesn't win material immediately\n- Other queen moves don't accomplish as much\n\n5. After Qxf8+ Kxf8, White can play Rhf1, attacking the black queen and preparing to double rooks. Black's position would collapse as their king is exposed and pieces are uncoordinated.\n\nThe most forcing and advantageous move is to capture the bishop immediately:\n\n```\ng8f8\n```"
