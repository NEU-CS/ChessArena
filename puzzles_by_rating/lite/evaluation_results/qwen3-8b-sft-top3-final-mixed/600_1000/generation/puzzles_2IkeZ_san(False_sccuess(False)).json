When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. First, let's understand the position:\n   - White has a bishop on c4 attacking the pawn on f7\n   - White's queen is on f3, eyeing the f7 pawn\n   - Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n   - Black's pawn structure is solid but needs development\n\n2. Key threats/considerations:\n   - The f7 pawn is under attack from both the bishop and queen\n   - We need to defend f7 while developing pieces\n   - The knight on g8 is our most active piece option\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - g8f6: Develops the knight to a good square, defends f7\n   - f8g7: Develops the bishop but blocks the g-pawn\n   - e7e6: Solid but doesn't address the f7 threat\n   - f7f6: Weakens the king's position\n\n4. Best options:\n   - g8f6 is very strong as it:\n     * Develops a piece\n     * Defends f7\n     * Prepares for castling\n     * Doesn't create weaknesses\n   - Other moves either don't address the threat or create weaknesses\n\n5. Other moves like f8g7 are playable but less active, and e7e6 is too passive.\n\nAfter considering all options, g8f6 is the most principled move that addresses all concerns while developing a piece.\n\n```\ng8f6\n```"
