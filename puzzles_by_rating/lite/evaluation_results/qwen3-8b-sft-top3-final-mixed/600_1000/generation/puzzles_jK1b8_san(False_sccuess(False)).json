When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on a5, eyeing the b6 queen\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on a6 that could become dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4 that could be advanced\n\n3. Threats:\n- White could play Qxb6 winning the queen\n- White could push a7 creating a dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b6d8: Gets the queen to safety while maintaining control\n- g8h8: Moves the king to safety\n- e4e3: Advances the passed pawn\n- b6g6: Defends the h6 pawn while keeping the queen active\n\nAfter considering these options, the most important priority is to save the queen while maintaining activity. b6d8 accomplishes this while also keeping pressure on White's position. The other moves either don't address the immediate threat or sacrifice too much activity.\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nb6d8\n```"
