When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop pair and more active pieces, but Black has a queen and rook vs White's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g4, eyeing the g2 pawn and potentially threatening mate on g1\n- White's king is exposed on g1 with limited pawn cover\n- Black has a rook on d8 controlling the open file\n- White's bishop on b5 is very active but needs to be careful about getting trapped\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black could play Qxg2# if not prevented\n- Black could also play Rd1+ with strong pressure\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5e8: Bishop sacrifice to remove the dangerous rook\n- f3g5: Blocking the queen's attack on g2 while developing\n- e3f5: Centralizing the knight and attacking the queen\n- g2h3: Moving the pawn to safety\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- b5e8 looks tempting but after Rxe8, White's position remains difficult\n- f3g5 is solid but allows Qxg5 with complications\n- e3f5 is very strong, attacking the queen while developing\n- g2h3 is too passive\n\nThe best move is e3f5, attacking the queen while centralizing the knight. Black will have to move the queen, and White can then follow up with Bxd7 or other active moves.\n\n```\ne3f5\n```"
