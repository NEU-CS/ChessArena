When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and pawn (White has queen, rook, knight vs Black's queen and rook). White has a strong attack.\n\n2. Key threats:\n- White's queen on d7 is attacking the rook on a8\n- White's rook on e5 is very active, eyeing the e-file\n- White's knight on g3 could potentially jump to f5 or e4\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n- White has potential mating threats with queen and rook coordination\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8 - moving the king away from potential checks\n- a8f8 - trading rooks to reduce White's attacking potential\n- c5f8 - blocking the queen's attack on the rook\n- c5e7 - defending the rook while attacking White's queen\n\nAfter evaluating:\n- g8h8 seems passive and doesn't address the immediate threats\n- a8f8 is interesting but after Rxf8, White's attack continues\n- c5f8 blocks but allows Qxf8 winning material\n- c5e7 is the most active, defending the rook while attacking the queen\n\nThe best move appears to be c5e7, as it:\n1) Defends the rook on a8\n2) Attacks White's queen\n3) Maintains material equality after Qxe7 Rxe7\n4) Reduces White's attacking potential\n\n```\nc5e7\n```"
