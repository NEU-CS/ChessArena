When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material is equal (both sides have a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns)\n2. Black has a strong pawn center with d5 and e5 pawns\n3. White's pieces are somewhat uncoordinated - the bishop on e3 is blocked by pawns\n4. Black's king is still in the center (e8) while White's is castled\n5. Black has potential threats with the queen on c7 eyeing the c2 bishop and the rook on f8\n\nKey observations:\n- The bishop on e3 is under attack from the pawn on d5\n- The knight on h2 is poorly placed and could be better utilized\n- The queen on d2 is somewhat exposed\n- Black's pawn on b6 is weak and could be a target\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. e3h6 - Bishop sacrifice to open the f-file\n2. c2h7 - Bishop sacrifice to disrupt Black's kingside\n3. d2e4 - Queen move attacking the e5 pawn\n4. h2g4 - Knight move attacking f6\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- e3h6 looks tempting but after ...gxh6, White doesn't get enough compensation\n- c2h7 is more promising as it forces ...Kxh7 and then Qxh7+ with a strong attack\n- Other moves don't create immediate threats\n\nThe best move is c2h7, sacrificing the bishop to expose Black's king. After:\n1. Bxh7 Kxh7\n2. Qxh7+ Kg8\nWhite has a strong attack with the queen and rook against the exposed black king.\n\n```\nc2h7\n```"
