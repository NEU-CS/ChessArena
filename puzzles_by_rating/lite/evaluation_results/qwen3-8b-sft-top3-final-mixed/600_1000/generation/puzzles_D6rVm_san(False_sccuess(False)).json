When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on g4 that could promote\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black's knight on h3 is threatening to fork with ...Nf2+\n- White's rook on d3 is very active\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g5: Attacks the h7 pawn but leaves the knight exposed\n- d3d8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, but Black can defend with ...Rd8\n- e5f6: Pushing the passed pawn, but Black can take with ...exf6\n- f1g3: Defends against ...Nf2+ but blocks the g-pawn\n- d3d7: Rook to 7th rank, putting pressure on Black's position\n\n4. Critical threats:\n- Must prevent ...Nf2+ which would be devastating\n- Must deal with the g4 pawn advance\n\nAfter considering these factors, the best move appears to be f1g3, which:\n- Defends against the immediate threat of ...Nf2+\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Keeps options open for both defense and counterplay\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. For example, moving the knight would leave the king vulnerable, and rook moves don't solve the knight fork issue.\n\n```\nf1g3\n```"
