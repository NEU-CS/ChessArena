When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

White has a strong centralized queen on e4 and active pieces\n3. Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover\n4. White has a passed pawn on b5 that could become dangerous\n5. Black's queen on g5 is active but potentially overextended\n\nKey observations:\n- White's queen on e4 is very strong and needs to be addressed\n- Black's knight on f5 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on d3\n- The immediate threat is Qxg2# if Black doesn't defend\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. g5e3 - Queen takes bishop, but after Qxe3 fxe3 White has strong pressure\n2. g5d8 - Queen retreats to defend, but looks passive\n3. g5h4 - Queen moves away from attack while maintaining pressure\n4. f5h4 - Knight moves to block the queen's path to g2\n5. g8h8 - King moves away from potential checks\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- g5h4 seems best as it maintains queen activity while getting out of attack\n- It prevents Qxg2# and keeps pressure on White's position\n- Other moves either lose material or allow White to maintain strong pressure\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\ng5h4\n```"
