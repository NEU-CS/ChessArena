When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has king + rook vs White's king + bishop + knight + pawns. Black is down significant material.\n\n2. Immediate threats:\n- White's bishop on b5 is attacking Black's rook on g2\n- White's knight on e3 could potentially jump to f5 or g4 with threats\n- White's king is centralized and can support pawn advances\n\n3. King safety:\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White could potentially create mating threats if Black's king gets too exposed\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Gets king away from potential checks but leaves rook hanging\n- f7e8: Similar to g8 but more central\n- g2g3: Saves the rook but allows White to play Kf3 with strong centralization\n- g2h2: Saves rook but leaves it passive\n- h7h5: Creates some counterplay with the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n5. Best defensive idea:\n- Need to save the rook while keeping some activity\n- g2g3 seems most practical as it:\n  - Saves the rook\n  - Keeps the rook active on the g-file\n  - Prevents White's king from advancing to f3\n  - Maintains some pressure on White's pawns\n\nAfter considering all options, g2g3 seems like the most resilient move in this difficult position.\n\n```\ng2g3\n```"
