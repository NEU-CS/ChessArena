When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns vs Black's Rook, Bishop, Rook, 3 pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed a-pawn which could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b7 is very active, attacking the black rook on c7\n- Black's rook on c7 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on d4\n- Black has a rook on c2 that's not defended\n- White's a-pawn is passed but blocked by Black's bishop on d6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7b8: Trading rooks when we're ahead in the exchange (Rook for Rook+Bishop is bad)\n- d4xc7: Capturing the pinned rook, but after Rxc7 we lose our active rook\n- a1a4: Bringing the rook to the 4th rank to support the a-pawn\n- d4h8: Bishop sacrifice to remove Black's strong bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4h8:\n- Removes Black's strong bishop\n- After Bxh8, Rxb7 wins the exchange (Rook for Rook+Bishop is good)\n- Black can't recapture with the king due to mate threats\n- This leads to a favorable endgame where White can push the a-pawn\n\nOther moves either don't capitalize on the pin or allow Black to maintain equality. The bishop sacrifice is the most forcing and advantageous continuation.\n\n```\nd4h8\n```"
