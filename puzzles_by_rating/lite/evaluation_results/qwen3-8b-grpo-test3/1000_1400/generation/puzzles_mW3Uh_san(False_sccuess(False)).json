When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, pawns. Black has a bishop, pawns, a rook, and a knight. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a4, b5, e3, h2. Black has pawns on a7, c6, h6. The b5 pawn is advanced and could be a threat.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on b2 is well-placed. The rook on c5 is active. Black's bishop on b1 is blocked by its own pawn on a7.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b5b6: Advances the pawn, but allows Black's knight to capture it\n- c5c8: Rook move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- b2e5: Bishop move, attacking the pawn\n- e3e4: Pawn push, gaining space\n- h2h4: Pawn push, creating space for the king\n\nThe most promising move seems to be e3e4. This:\n- Gains space in the center\n- Opens lines for White's pieces\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Maintains control over d4\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3e4\n```"
