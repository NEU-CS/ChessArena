When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a passed e-pawn that's advanced to e6.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is also uncastled.\n\n3. Threats: White's e6 pawn is very advanced and threatening. Black's g3 queen is attacking the f2 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g3f2: Capturing the pawn with the queen\n- g6e4: Knight move attacking the d2 pawn\n- g3e5: Moving the queen to defend the e6 pawn\n- f6f5: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n- b8c6: Developing the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's e6 pawn. If it promotes, White will have a decisive material advantage. Therefore, we need to address this immediately.\n\nThe best move is to capture the f2 pawn with the queen, which also opens lines for our pieces and maintains pressure on White's position.\n\n```\ng3f2\n```"
