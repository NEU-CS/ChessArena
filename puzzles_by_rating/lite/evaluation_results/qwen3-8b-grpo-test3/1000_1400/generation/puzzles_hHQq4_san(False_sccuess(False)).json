When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on e6 is attacking the black rook on f8. White's bishop on e5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Legal moves: Only three options - g8h8, g8h7, or f8f7.\n\n- g8h8: Moves the king to the corner, but doesn't address the immediate threat to the rook.\n- g8h7: Moves the king towards the center, but still leaves the rook under attack.\n- f8f7: Moves the rook to defend against the queen's attack while also potentially preparing to castle kingside.\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the f8 rook. All moves leave the king exposed, but f8f7 at least addresses the immediate threat to the rook. The other moves don't help defend against White's pieces.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf8f7\n```"
