When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on e7 is attacking Black's rook on d8. White's queen on h5 is eyeing the h7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d8g8: Moves the rook to defend the king\n- d7e6: Knight move attacking the knight\n- c5e3: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- d3e2: Rook move attacking the knight\n- f5f4: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e7 attacking the rook. If we don't address this, White can play Nxd5 or Nf5.\n\nThe best move is d7e6, moving the knight to defend the rook while also attacking the knight on e7. This:\n- Defends the rook\n- Attacks the knight\n- Opens the d7-square for the bishop\n- Maintains control over e6\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nd7e6\n```"
