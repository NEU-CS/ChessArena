When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, queen, rook, pawns. Black has a knight, bishop, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on c8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on g3 is attacking the g2 bishop. White's queen on e6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e6g4: Queen takes pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat to the bishop\n- g2f3: Bishop move that attacks the queen\n- f4g4: Rook move that attacks the queen\n- e6e2: Queen move that threatens the pawn\n- a1g1: Rook move that defends the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the black queen on g3 attacking the white bishop on g2. If we don't address this, we'll lose the bishop.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- g2f3 seems most direct, attacking the queen while moving the bishop to safety\n- f4g4 also attacks the queen but leaves the bishop under attack\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threat\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move the bishop to f3, attacking the queen while getting out of harm's way.\n\n```\ng2f3\n```"
