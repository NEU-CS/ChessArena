Candidate moves:\n- e5d6: Bishop takes pawn - but this allows White's rook to capture the bishop\n- e5f5: Bishop moves - but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d5e6: King moves - this seems most promising as it:\n  - Moves the king towards White's king\n  - Protects the pawn on e5\n  - Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n  - Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nThe other moves either don't help or create new problems.

Black needs to address this immediately.\n\nThe best move is to play f7f5, which:\n- Creates space for the rook on f4\n- Opens the f-file for Black's rook\n- Prevents White from playing f2-f4 which would support the b-pawn\n- Maintains control over the e5 square for the king\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nf7f5\n```"
