When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on f7 is very active. The knight on b3 and queen on c3 are well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's pawn on f5 is attacking the black pawn on e5. The knight on b3 is eyeing the e6 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f7g8: Bishop takes rook - but black's rook is protected by the knight\n- f7e8: Bishop takes queen - this wins the queen\n- f7g6: Bishop move - but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- g5g8: Rook move - but doesn't threaten anything\n- c3d5: Queen move - attacks the knight\n- b3e6: Knight move - attacks the pawn\n\nThe most forcing move is f7e8, capturing the queen. After this:\n- If black takes with the knight (Nxe8), white can play Qxh8 winning the rook\n- If black doesn't take, white has won the queen\n\nOther moves don't offer such immediate gains. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf7e8\n```"
