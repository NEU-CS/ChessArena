When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on d5 is eyeing the d-file. White's rook on e7 is attacking the black rook on e8.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h1g1: Moves the king towards safety but doesn't address other issues\n- e7e4: Captures the pawn and opens the e-file for White's rook\n- h3g2: Captures the pawn but leaves the h-pawn vulnerable\n\nThe most pressing concern is the e7 rook attacking the e8 rook. If we don't address this, Black can simply take our rook with Re8xe7.\n\ne7e4 seems the most promising:\n- Captures the pawn\n- Opens the e-file for our rook\n- Maintains pressure on the e8 rook\n- Creates potential for a discovered attack if the bishop moves\n\nThe other moves don't address the immediate threat to our rook. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7e4\n```"
