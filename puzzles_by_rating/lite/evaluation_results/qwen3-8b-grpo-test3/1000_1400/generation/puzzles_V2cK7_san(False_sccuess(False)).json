When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a king and two pawns (b6, d6). White has a king, two pawns (a4, c4), and a pawn on d5. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is very active at f4, while White's king is at h2.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White has passed pawns on a4 and c4\n   - Black has pawns on a5, b6, c5\n   - The d5 pawn is isolated\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - f4g5: Moves king towards the a-pawn\n   - f4f5: Moves king towards the center\n   - f4e5: Moves king towards the d-pawn\n   - f4e4: Moves king towards the c-pawn\n   - f4f3: Moves king towards the h-pawn\n   - f4e3: Moves king towards the b-pawn\n   - b6b5: Advances the b-pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's passed a-pawn which could promote if not addressed. The king should move towards it to stop it. f4g5 is the most direct route towards the a-pawn while also maintaining flexibility to move towards other pawns if needed.\n\nOther moves either don't address the a-pawn or move the king away from the action. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf4g5\n```"
