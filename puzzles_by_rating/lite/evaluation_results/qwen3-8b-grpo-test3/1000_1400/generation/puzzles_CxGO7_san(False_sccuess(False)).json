When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a queen and bishop for a knight (White has Q+R+2P vs Black's N+2P). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g7.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on e6 is attacking the knight on c6. White's rook on c1 is eyeing the c-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c6e5: Moves the knight to defend the queen while attacking the pawn\n- b6d4: Moves the knight to attack the rook\n- h5e5: Moves the rook to attack the queen\n- g6g5: Moves the pawn to gain space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the knight. If we don't defend it, White can capture it with Qxc6. Therefore, we need to move the knight to safety while maintaining counterplay.\n\nc6e5 seems the most flexible move:\n- It moves the knight to safety\n- It attacks the e5 pawn\n- It opens the possibility of Nf3 or Nd3 later\n- It doesn't weaken our position\n\nOther moves:\n- b6d4 allows Rc3\n- h5e5 allows Qxe5\n- g6g5 doesn't address the immediate threat\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
