When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+B+Q). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on c4 is very active. Black's bishop on c8 is inactive.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on g4 is eyeing the h6 pawn. White's bishop on c4 is attacking the a6 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- a5a4: Attacks the a3 pawn and opens the a-file for Black's rook\n- c7e5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the knight\n- c7f4: Attacks the knight and prepares to castle\n- g6g5: Kicks the knight and gains space\n- e6e5: Opens the center and gains space\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is e6e5. This:\n- Opens the center\n- Gains space for Black's pieces\n- Prepares potential pawn breaks like d5\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Maintains control over d4\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- a5a4 weakens b4\n- c7e5 exposes the queen\n- g6g5 weakens h5\n- c7f4 doesn't improve the position\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6e5\n```"
