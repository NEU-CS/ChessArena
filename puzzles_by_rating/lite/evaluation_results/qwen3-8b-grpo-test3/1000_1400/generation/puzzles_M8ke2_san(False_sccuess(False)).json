When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on g7 is eyeing the g3 pawn. White's queen on c6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e1e6: Rook move attacking the queen\n- f5e6: Pawn capture winning the pawn\n- g3g4: Pawn move creating space for the king\n- c6e8: Queen move attacking the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the safety of White's king. The move g3g4:\n- Creates space for the king to move to g3 if needed\n- Opens the g-file for the rook\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Maintains control over the e4 square\n\nOther moves:\n- e1e6 would leave the king exposed\n- f5e6 would open the f-file for Black's rook\n- c6e8 would move the queen away from the center\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
