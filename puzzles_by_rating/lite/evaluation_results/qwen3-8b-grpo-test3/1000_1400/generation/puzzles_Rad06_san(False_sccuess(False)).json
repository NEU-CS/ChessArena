When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's B+P). White has a passed d-pawn that's advanced to d6.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on g3 is eyeing the h5 pawn. White's queen on g3 is close to Black's king.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d5e3: Knight move attacking the queen\n- d5f4: Knight move attacking the knight\n- f5f4: Pawn push creating space for the knight\n- h7h6: Pawn move giving the king an escape square\n- g7g6: Pawn move similar to h7h6\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen near Black's king. d5e3 both attacks the queen and develops the knight to a more active position. After this move:\n- If Qxh4, then Nxd2 winning the rook\n- If Qf3, then Nxd2 again\n- White's knight on g3 is also addressed\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5e3\n```"
