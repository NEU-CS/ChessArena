When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f1. Black's king is on g7.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on g4 is attacking the pawn on e3. Black's queen on h3 is eyeing the h2 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f1g1: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f1e1: Moves king towards the center but still leaves it exposed\n- e4g2: The bishop move is most interesting - it attacks the knight and opens a line for the white queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on g4. If we don't address it, it could capture the e3 pawn or move to f2. The bishop move e4g2:\n- Attacks the knight\n- Opens the diagonal for the white queen to potentially attack the black queen\n- Maintains control over e3 pawn\n\nThe other moves don't address the immediate threats. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne4g2\n```"
