When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g5, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on d3 is attacking White's knight on c4. White's knight on c4 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d3d2: Attacks the knight and prepares to promote the pawn\n- d3d1: Similar idea\n- e6f4: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- g5f4: King move attacking the knight\n- h6h5: Pawn move creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's passed pawn on d7 which is close to promotion. Black needs to address this immediately.\n\nThe best move is d3d2, attacking the knight and preparing to promote the pawn if White doesn't defend properly. This also keeps pressure on White's position.\n\n```\nd3d2\n```"
