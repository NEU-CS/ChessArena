When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight (White has B+B+R+R vs Black's R+R). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on f5, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, b3, g3. Black has pawns on a5, b4, g5. The b-pawn is isolated and vulnerable.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on d4 is very active. Black's rook on f5 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f5g6: Moves the rook towards the kingside, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f5f4: Attacks the d4 rook, but White can simply move it\n- f5e4: Moves the rook towards the center and attacks the d4 rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on d4, which is very active. All three moves address this to some extent. f5e4 seems most promising as it:\n- Moves the rook towards the center\n- Attacks the d4 rook\n- Opens potential lines for Black's bishop on g4\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf5e4\n```"
