When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on f8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on e1 is attacking White's pawn on e2. White's rook on h7 is close to Black's king.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g5e4: Knight takes pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat to e2 pawn\n- g5f3: Knight move that protects e2 pawn\n- f2f3: Pawn move that also protects e2 pawn\n\nBetween g5f3 and f2f3, f2f3 seems better because:\n- It protects the e2 pawn directly\n- Opens the f-file for White's rook\n- Doesn't expose the knight to potential attacks\n- Maintains flexibility for the knight\n\ng5f3 would also protect e2, but leaves the knight more exposed and doesn't open lines for White's pieces.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf2f3\n```"
