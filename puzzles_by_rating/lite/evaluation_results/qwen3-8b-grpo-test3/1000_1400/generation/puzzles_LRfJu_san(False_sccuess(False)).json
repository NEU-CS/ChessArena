When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a pawn (White has Rook, Rook, Bishop; Black has Rook, Bishop). Materially, White has a significant advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on d8 is attacking Black's rook on g7. White's rook on f1 is also a threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7d7: Moves the rook to defend the d-file\n- g7e7: Moves the rook to defend the e-file\n- f3h5: Bishop move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f3g4: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3e4: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3g2: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3e2: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3h1: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3d1: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- b7b6: Pawn move, but doesn't help\n- g6g5: Pawn move, but doesn't help\n- b5b4: Pawn move, but doesn't help\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the g7 rook. The best move is to move the rook to e7, where it defends the e-file and also protects the g7 square from further attacks.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng7e7\n```"
