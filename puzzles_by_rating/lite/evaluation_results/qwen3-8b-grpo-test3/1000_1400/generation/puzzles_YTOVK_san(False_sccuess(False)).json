When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on g5 is very active. Black's knight on g6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's bishop on g5 is attacking the h6 pawn. Black's knight on g6 is protecting it.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g5h6: Capturing the pawn with the bishop\n- g5f6: Moving the bishop to f6\n- e1e8: Rook move to e8\n- b3g8: Bishop move to g8\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. While none of the moves directly address this, we should look for moves that improve our position while maintaining pressure.\n\ng5h6 seems most promising:\n- Captures the pawn\n- Opens the h-file for White's rook\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- Doesn't expose White to new threats\n\nOther moves:\n- g5f6 would retreat the bishop but lose the initiative\n- e1e8 is too slow\n- b3g8 doesn't accomplish much\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5h6\n```"
