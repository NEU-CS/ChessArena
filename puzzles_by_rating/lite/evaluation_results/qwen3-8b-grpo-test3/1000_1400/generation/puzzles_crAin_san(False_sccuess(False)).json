When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, pawns. Black has a bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on f3 is well-placed. Black's knight on c6 is also active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's knight on d4 is attacking White's pawn on e2. White needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e2d2: Moves the queen to defend the e2 pawn\n- f3d4: Captures the knight on d4\n- e2e4: Moves the queen to a more active position\n- c1e3: Develops the bishop\n- e1g1: Castles kingside\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on d4 attacking e2. If we don't address this, Black could play Nxe2 winning the queen.\n\nThe best move is to capture the knight with f3d4. This:\n- Removes the immediate threat to e2\n- Opens the e-file for White's rook\n- Maintains control of the center\n- Doesn't weaken any pawns\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nf3d4\n```"
