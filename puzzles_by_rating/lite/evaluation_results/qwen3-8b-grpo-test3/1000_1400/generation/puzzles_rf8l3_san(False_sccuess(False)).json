When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on f7 is eyeing the f2 pawn. White's knight on e4 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4f6: Knight move attacking the queen\n- e4d6: Knight move centralizing\n- e4g5: Knight move towards the king\n- h3h4: Pawn push creating space\n- d2e3: Pawn capture opening lines\n- a1g1: Rook move defending the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. The move a1g1 (Rook move) would:\n- Defend the h1 rook\n- Create a barrier against potential checks\n- Maintain control over the g-file\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na1g1\n```"
