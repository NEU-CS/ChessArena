When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is well-placed at e4. Black's king is at b6, close to White's pawns.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White's pawns: a6 is blocked by Black's king. c6 is advanced but needs support.\n   - Black's pawns: g4 and g3 are advanced but can be stopped by White's king.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - e4f5: Moves king towards Black's pawns but away from White's pawns\n   - e4e5: Moves king towards the center but doesn't help much\n   - e4d5: Moves king towards White's pawns and away from Black's pawns\n   - e4d3: Moves king towards the queenside\n   - c6c7: Advances the pawn but it's currently blocked by Black's king\n   - a6a7: Advances the pawn but it's also blocked by Black's king\n\nThe most promising move is e4d5 because:\n- It moves the king towards White's c-pawn which needs protection\n- It maintains distance from Black's g-pawns\n- It keeps options open to move towards either flank\n- Other moves either don't help or move the king in a less useful direction\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne4d5\n```"
