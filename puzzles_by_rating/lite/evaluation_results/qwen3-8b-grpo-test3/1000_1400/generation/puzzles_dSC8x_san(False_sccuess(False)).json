When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, pawns, a knight (though it's not visible in the FEN, implied by the 'k' in the FEN). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g4, also exposed.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on f4 is attacking White's pawn on g2. White's queen on d5 is well-placed but needs to be careful about counterattacks.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d5f3: Queen takes pawn, attacking the black queen\n- d3e4: Bishop move, protecting the g2 pawn\n- d5e4: Queen move, protecting the g2 pawn\n- Other moves seem less relevant\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on g2. Both d5e4 (queen move) and d3e4 (bishop move) protect this pawn. The bishop move (d3e4) seems more flexible as it also opens lines for the white bishop and doesn't block the queen's movement.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd3e4\n```"
