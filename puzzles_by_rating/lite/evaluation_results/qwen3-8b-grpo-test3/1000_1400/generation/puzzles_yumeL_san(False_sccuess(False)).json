When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g3. Black's king is on e5, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: Black has pawns on c6, h6, and h5. White has pawns on d3, h4, and g3. The h-pawns are locked.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's bishop on a5 is well-placed. White's knight on c5 is very active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e5f6: King move towards the knight\n- e5d6: King move towards the center\n- e5d5: King move towards the center\n- e5d4: King move towards the knight\n- a5d8: Bishop move (but doesn't accomplish much)\n- a5c7: Bishop move (similar)\n- a5b6: Bishop move (attacks the knight)\n- a5b4: Bishop move (attacks the pawn)\n- a5c3: Bishop move (attacks the pawn)\n- a5d2: Bishop move (attacks the pawn)\n- a5e1: Bishop move (doesn't accomplish much)\n- g6g5: Pawn push (creates space for the king)\n- f5f4: Pawn push (attacks the h4 pawn)\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be:\n1. a5b6 - attacking the knight and forcing it to move\n2. f5f4 - gaining space and attacking the h4 pawn\n3. g6g5 - creating space for the king\n\nAfter considering all options, a5b6 seems the most forcing move, as it directly attacks the knight and forces a response. This also opens up possibilities for Black's bishop to become more active.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na5b6\n```"
