When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on a3 is attacking White's rook on e1. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5a1: Queen takes rook - but Black's queen is already on a3\n- e1a1: Rook moves to safety\n- f2g3: King moves to safety\n- e3e4: Pawn push\n- e5h2: Queen move\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the rook. e1a1 (Rook to a1) would:\n- Move the rook out of attack\n- Maintain control of the first rank\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems (like f2g3 leaving the king exposed).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne1a1\n```"
