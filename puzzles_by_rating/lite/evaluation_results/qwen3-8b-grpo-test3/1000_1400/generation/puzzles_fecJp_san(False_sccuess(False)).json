When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+Q+B, Black has R+B+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on e7. White's king is still in the center but relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on h6 is attacking the g8 rook. White's queen on h5 is eyeing the h7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e7e8: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e7f7: Moves king towards the queen but still leaves the knight attack\n- e7d7: Moves king towards the center but doesn't help\n- e7e6: Moves king towards the knight but still leaves the queen threat\n- e7d6: Moves king towards the knight and also gets away from the queen's line\n- h7g6: Captures the knight with the pawn, eliminating the immediate threat to the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h6 attacking the rook. While none of the king moves fully address this, h7g6 directly captures the knight and removes the threat. After this capture, White's queen remains active but the immediate danger is eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh7g6\n```"
