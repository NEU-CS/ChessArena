When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, bishop, pawns. Black has a queen, rook, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h2. Black's king is on d6.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on f2 is attacking White's bishop on g3. White's queen on g7 is under attack by Black's pawn on h7.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7h8: Queen takes rook (but there's no rook on h8)\n- g7g8: Queen moves to g8\n- g7f8: Queen moves to f8\n- g7h6: Queen moves to h6\n- g7g5: Queen moves to g5\n- g7e5: Queen moves to e5\n- g7d4: Queen moves to d4\n- g7c3: Queen moves to c3\n- g7b2: Queen moves to b2\n- g7a1: Queen moves to a1\n- g4g5: Pawn advance\n- c4c5: Pawn advance\n- b3b4: Pawn advance\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the bishop on g3. If we don't address this, Black can capture the bishop with Qxg3.\n\nThe best move is to move the queen to e5 (g7e5), which:\n- Defends the bishop on g3\n- Opens the e5 square for the queen to attack Black's queen\n- Maintains control over the center\n- Doesn't expose the queen to any new threats\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\ng7e5\n```"
