When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on g4 is eyeing the pawn on f3. Black's queen on f6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d4f6: Capturing the queen with the knight seems most forcing\n- d3e2: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- d2f3: Knight move defending the pawn\n- e4e5: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the queen on f6. If we don't take it, Black can play Qxh4 or Qe6. Therefore, capturing the queen with d4f6 seems mandatory.\n\nAfter d4f6, if Black recaptures with gxf6, we can play Nxf3 defending the pawn. If Black doesn't take, we maintain the initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd4f6\n```"
