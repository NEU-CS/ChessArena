When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h2. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on d5 is attacking White's pawn on e4. White's queen on c5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5e6: Pushing the pawn opens lines for White's pieces\n- c5d6: Capturing the pawn with the queen\n- e3h6: Bishop move attacking the h6 pawn\n- b1c3: Knight development\n- f2f4: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on d5 attacking e4. If we don't address this, Black could win the pawn.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- c5d6 captures the pawn and removes the threat to e4\n- e5e6 creates space but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- Other moves are less relevant to the current position\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the pawn with the queen:\n\n```\nc5d6\n```"
