Legal moves: Only g1h1 is available (king move).\n\nThis is a critical position where White is in check from the queen on f2. The only legal move is to move the king to h1. \n\nMoving to h1:\n- Gets out of check from the queen\n- Moves the king away from potential knight checks\n- Maintains control over the g1 square\n\nOther options:\n- There are no other legal moves (no pieces can block or capture the checking queen)\n\nTherefore, the only possible move is:\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
