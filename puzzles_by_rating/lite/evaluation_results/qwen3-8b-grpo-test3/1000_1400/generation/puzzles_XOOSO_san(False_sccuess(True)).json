When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen on h7 attacking the rook.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on f1.\n\n3. Immediate threats: White's queen on h7 is attacking the rook on g8. If the rook moves, White can play Qxg6 winning the pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves: Only legal move is g8f8 (Rook moves to f8).\n\nAfter g8f8:\n- The rook moves out of attack from the queen\n- White can play Bxf6 winning the knight\n- Black's position remains difficult but at least the immediate threat is addressed\n\nOther options:\n- There are no other legal moves available\n\nConclusion: The only move is to move the rook to f8 to prevent the queen from capturing the rook while also opening a line for the queen to attack the knight on f6.\n\n```\ng8f8\n```"
