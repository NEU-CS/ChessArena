When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g3. Black's king is on f6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: Black has pawns on a7, b6, d4, h5. White has pawns on a3, b3, c2, g4. The d4 pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's rook on f7 is well-placed. White's rook on e2 is active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f7f8: Rook move, but doesn't accomplish much\n- f7h7: Rook move, could be useful for defense\n- f7g7: Rook move, protects the king\n- f7e7: Rook move, could attack the white rook\n- f7d7: Rook move, could attack the d4 pawn\n- f7c7: Rook move, doesn't seem useful\n- f7b7: Rook move, could attack the b6 pawn\n- f6g7: King move, but exposes the king\n- f6g6: King move, more central\n- a7a6: Pawn move, doesn't seem useful\n- b6b5: Pawn move, could open lines for the rook\n- h5h4: Pawn move, gains space\n- d4d3: Pawn move, advances the isolated pawn\n- a7a5: Pawn move, doesn't seem useful\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be:\n1. d4d3 - advancing the isolated pawn and opening lines for the rook\n2. f7d7 - attacking the d4 pawn with the rook\n3. b6b5 - opening lines for the rook\n\nAfter considering all options, d4d3 seems the most active move, advancing the pawn and creating potential threats.\n\n```\nd4d3\n```"
