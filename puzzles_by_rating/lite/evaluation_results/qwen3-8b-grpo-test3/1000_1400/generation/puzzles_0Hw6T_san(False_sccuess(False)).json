When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g5. Black's king is on d7.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on g3 is attacking White's bishop on e3. White's pawn on f5 is advanced and could be dangerous.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g3e5: Bishop move attacking the pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g3f4: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- g3h2: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- g3f2: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- g3e1: Bishop move attacking the rook\n- a6a5: Pawn move creating space for the bishop\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's advanced f5 pawn which could promote if not addressed. The bishop moves all seem to be defensive, while a6a5 is a proactive pawn move that:\n- Creates space for the bishop on g3\n- Opens the a-file for Black's rook (if it were still on the board)\n- Doesn't weaken any pawns\n\nGiven the material disadvantage, Black needs to play actively. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na6a5\n```"
