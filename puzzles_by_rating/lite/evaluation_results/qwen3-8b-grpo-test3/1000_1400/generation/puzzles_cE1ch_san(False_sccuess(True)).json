When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on h5. White's king is on a4, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on g5 is attacking the black pawn on f5. White's bishop on d6 is protected by the pawn on e5.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h5h6: Moves the king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h5h4: Moves the king towards the queenside where White's king is\n\nThe more pressing concern is White's queen on g5. If we don't address it, White could play Qxh6 or Qf6 with threats.\n\nh5h4 seems more promising as it:\n- Moves the king towards the queenside where White's king is\n- Potentially prepares to defend the f5 pawn\n- Doesn't leave the king as exposed as h5h6 would\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh5h4\n```"
