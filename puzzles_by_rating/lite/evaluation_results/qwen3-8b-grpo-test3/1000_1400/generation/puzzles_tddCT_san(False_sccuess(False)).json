King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on h3 is attacking White's pawn on g2. If the knight captures g2, it would be a serious threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g1g2: Moves king towards the knight but doesn't address the immediate threat to g2\n- g1h1: Moves king away from potential checks but doesn't help\n- g1f1: Moves king towards the center and away from potential checks\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h3 threatening g2. While none of the moves directly address this, g1f1 seems the most flexible:\n\n- It moves the king towards the center\n- It avoids potential checks from Black's rook\n- It maintains options for future moves\n\nThe other moves have drawbacks:\n- g1g2 would block the knight's path to g2\n- g1h1 is too passive\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"
