When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e1. Black's king is on d7, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on g7 is attacking Black's rook on e8. White's knight on e6 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves: Only d7d6 is legal. This move:\n- Moves the king away from the d-file where it's exposed to the knight\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook on e8\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther considerations:\n- White's queen is very active on g7\n- Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by the pawn on d6\n- White's knight on e6 is a strong piece\n\nAfter d7d6, White can play things like Nxc7 or Qxh8, but Black will have some counterplay with the open d-file.\n\nSince this is the only legal move, it's the best option available. The position is lost for Black, but this move makes it as difficult as possible for White.\n\n```\nd7d6\n```"
