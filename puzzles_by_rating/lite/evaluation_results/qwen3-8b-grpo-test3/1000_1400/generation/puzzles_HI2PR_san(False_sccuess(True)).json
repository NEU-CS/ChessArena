Available moves:\n- h8g8: Moves the king towards the corner but doesn't address the bishop\n- h8g7: Captures the bishop with the king\n\nThe only reasonable move is h8g7, capturing the bishop with the king. This:\n- Removes the immediate threat to the king\n- Maintains the king's position\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nh8g8 would leave the king exposed to further attacks from White's pieces.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh8g7\n```"

Legal move: Only g7f6 is available (Knight move from g7 to f6).\n\nLooking at g7f6:\n- Moves the knight to f6 where it's more active\n- Protects the rook on g8\n- Doesn't immediately address the queen attack on the rook\n- After this move, White can play Qxg8 winning the rook\n\nUnfortunately, Black is in a very difficult position. The knight move doesn't solve the immediate problems. White's queen on h7 is too strong.\n\nGiven the circumstances, g7f6 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose material, though the position remains lost.\n\n```\ng7f6\n```"
