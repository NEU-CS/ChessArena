When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, queen, rook, pawns. Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on g3 is attacking the h3 pawn. White's queen on d5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d5g5: Queen takes pawn, but allows Rg3xh3\n- e6g5: Knight move attacking the rook\n- d5f3: Queen move attacking the rook\n- h3h4: Pawn move creating space for the king\n- f1g1: Rook move protecting the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on g3 attacking h3. If we don't address this, Black can play Rg3xh3 winning the pawn.\n\ne6g5 (knight to g5) seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the rook on g3\n- Opens the e6-knight's eye on f7\n- If Black moves the rook, we can consider Qd5-g5 or other moves\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6g5\n```"
