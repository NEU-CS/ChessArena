King safety: White's king is exposed at c2. Black's king is at g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen at e2 is attacking White's rook at d1. White must address this immediate threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c2c3: Moves king away from potential checks but doesn't address the rook threat\n- c2c1: Moves king towards the corner but still leaves the rook under attack\n- d1d2: Moves the rook out of attack while maintaining control of the d-file\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the d1 rook. While none of the moves are perfect, d1d2 is the most principled move as it:\n- Gets the rook out of attack\n- Maintains control of the d-file\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nThe other moves leave the rook under attack or don't improve the position. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd1d2\n```"
