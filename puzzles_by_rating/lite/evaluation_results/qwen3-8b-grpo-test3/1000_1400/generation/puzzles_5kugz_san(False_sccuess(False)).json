When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on b3 is eyeing the b7 pawn. White's pawns on d5 and e5 are advanced and threatening.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e6g4: Bishop move attacking the g4 pawn\n- e6f5: Bishop move controlling e4\n- e6d5: Bishop takes pawn\n- b6d5: Knight takes pawn\n- c7e5: Queen move attacking the e5 pawn\n- f7f5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the d5 pawn which is isolated and vulnerable. Both the knight on b6 and bishop on e6 are eyeing it. Taking the pawn with either piece seems most urgent.\n\nBetween e6d5 (bishop takes) and b6d5 (knight takes), the knight capture is better because:\n1. It opens the e6-bishop's diagonal\n2. The knight becomes more active\n3. It maintains pressure on the d5 pawn\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb6d5\n```"
