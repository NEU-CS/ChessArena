When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f3. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on f1 is attacking White's pawn on g2. White's rook on g6 is attacking Black's pawn on g7.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f1f3: Capturing the king would be illegal\n- f1f2: Attacking the pawn\n- f1e1: Moving to safety\n- a7f7: Rook move attacking the pawn\n- a4c3: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- h6h5: Pawn move creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on g6 attacking the g7 pawn. If White captures g7 with Rxg7, White will have a strong passed pawn on g6.\n\nThe best move is to defend the g7 pawn with a7f7, moving the rook to f7 where it protects both the pawn and the king. This also opens the a7-rook to potentially attack White's pawns.\n\n```\na7f7\n```"
