When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety:\n- White king is exposed on h1\n- Black king is on a6, relatively safe\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black queen on e2 is attacking the h2 pawn\n- White queen on c6 is attacking the b7 rook\n- White rook on b1 is eyeing the b-file\n\n4. Candidate moves:\na) a6a7 - Moves king towards the center\nb) a6a5 - Moves king towards the pawns\nc) b7b6 - Moves rook away from the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the white queen on c6 attacking the b7 rook. If we don't address this, white can capture the rook with Qxb7.\n\n- a6a7 doesn't help defend the rook\n- a6a5 also doesn't address the immediate threat\n- b7b6 moves the rook out of attack while maintaining control of the b-file\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move the rook to b6 to defend it from the queen while maintaining control of the b-file.\n\n```\nb7b6\n```"
