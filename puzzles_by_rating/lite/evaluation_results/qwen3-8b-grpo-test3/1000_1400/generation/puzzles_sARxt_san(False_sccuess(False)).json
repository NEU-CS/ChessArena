When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's B+P). White has a passed pawn on c6 that's very advanced.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is on c8.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on b5 is eyeing the a6 pawn. White's knight on f3 is well-placed. Black's queen on e4 is well-placed but needs to be careful about attacks.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4c6: Capturing the pawn with the queen seems most pressing - it removes the advanced pawn and opens the c-file for Black's rook\n- f5e7: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- f5d6: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- e4d5: Queen move attacking the knight\n- b7c6: Pawn capture of the pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the c6 pawn. If White promotes it, the game is lost. Therefore, the most urgent move is to capture the pawn with the queen:\n\n```\ne4c6\n```"
