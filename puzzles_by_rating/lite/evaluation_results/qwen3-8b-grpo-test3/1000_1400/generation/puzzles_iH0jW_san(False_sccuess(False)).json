When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a king and bishop. Black has a king, knight, and pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b5. Black's king is on d4, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on d3 and h4. Black has a pawn on g5. The h-pawn is advanced and could be dangerous.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop is well-placed on f5. Black's knight on e2 is well-placed.\n\n5. Threats: Black's knight on e2 is attacking White's pawn on d3. White needs to address this.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- Bishop moves: Most bishop moves don't address the immediate threat to d3 pawn. f5e4 looks interesting as it attacks the knight.\n- King moves: b5c6 or b5a6 move the king towards the center or queenside. b5c6 seems most useful as it protects the d3 pawn indirectly.\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight attacking d3 pawn. While none of the moves directly defend d3, b5c6 moves the king closer to the pawn and also opens up possibilities for the bishop to defend it later.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb5c6\n```"
