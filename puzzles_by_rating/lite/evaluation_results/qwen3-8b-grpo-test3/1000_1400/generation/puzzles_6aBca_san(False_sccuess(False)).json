When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on h4 is attacking the pawn on g2. White's knight on d5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f2g3: Moves the king towards the knight while protecting the g2 pawn\n- f2g1: Moves the king towards the corner but doesn't address the knight threat\n\nThe immediate concern is the knight on h4 attacking g2. If we don't address this, the knight could capture the pawn or deliver checks.\n\nf2g3:\n- Moves the king towards the knight\n- Protects the g2 pawn\n- Maintains some flexibility for the king\n- Doesn't leave the king more exposed\n\nf2g1:\n- Moves the king towards the corner\n- Doesn't address the knight threat\n- Could be more vulnerable to checks later\n\nThe better move is f2g3 as it addresses the immediate threat while maintaining king safety. f2g1 would leave the king more exposed without solving the knight problem.\n\n```\nf2g3\n```"
