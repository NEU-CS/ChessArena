When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on a7.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on h3 is attacking White's pawn on g2. White's bishop on d3 is under attack by Black's pawn on e4.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b3e6: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- c3f6: Knight move attacking the queen\n- f2f4: Pawn push creating space\n- e3f4: Pawn capture opening the e-file\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h3 attacking g2. If we don't address this, Black could play Nxf2 winning the pawn.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- e3f4 seems most appealing as it:\n  - Captures the pawn\n  - Opens the e-file for White's rook\n  - Removes the pawn protecting e4\n  - Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3f4\n```"
