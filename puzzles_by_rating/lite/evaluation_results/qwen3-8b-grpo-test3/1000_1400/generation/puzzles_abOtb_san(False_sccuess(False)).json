When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+B+N, Black has B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (RK2R). Black's king is also in the center (g8).\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on b5 is very active. Black's knight on c6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White has a passed pawn on d4 that could be dangerous. Black needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c6d4: Capturing the pawn with the knight seems most pressing. It opens the c-file for Black's rook and removes the passed pawn.\n- d7e5: Bishop move attacking the e-pawn\n- e7e5: Pawn push creating space\n- f7f5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the d4 pawn. If White plays d5 soon, it could become very dangerous. Therefore, capturing the pawn with the knight seems most urgent.\n\nAfter c6d4, if White recaptures with the queen (Qxd4), Black can play ...Nxb2 winning the pawn. If White doesn't take, Black can play ...Nxb2 anyway.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc6d4\n```"
