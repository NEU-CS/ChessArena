When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on e5 is very active. Black's knight on f6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on e5 is attacking the pawn on d7. White's bishop on b4 is eyeing the a5 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f6e4: Knight move attacking the knight\n- f6h5: Knight move threatening h4 pawn\n- f6g4: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- d6e5: Capturing the knight with the bishop\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e5. If we don't address it, White can play Nxd6 or Nf3 with strong threats.\n\nd6e5 (Bxe5) seems most appealing:\n- Captures the knight\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e5\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems (like f6e4 allowing Nxd6).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd6e5\n```"
