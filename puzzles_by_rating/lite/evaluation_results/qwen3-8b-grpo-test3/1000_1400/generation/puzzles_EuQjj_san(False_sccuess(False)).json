When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Materially, White is ahead.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on h1.\n\n3. Threats: White has a passed pawn on d4 that could promote. Black's queen on e6 is well-placed but needs to defend against White's threats.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e6e4: Queen move attacking the d4 pawn\n- e6f5: Queen move attacking the f2 pawn\n- f7f5: Pawn move creating space for the queen\n- g7g5: Pawn move creating space for the queen\n- e6h3: Queen move attacking the h2 pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the d4 pawn. If it promotes, White will have a decisive material advantage. Therefore, the best move is to attack this pawn with the queen:\n\n```\ne6e4\n```"
