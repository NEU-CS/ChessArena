When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on b1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on c4 is attacking White's pawn on b2. White's knight on g3 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- a7a8: Rook move, but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- a7f7: Rook move, but doesn't help\n- g3f5: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- e2g4: Rook move, but doesn't address the knight on c4\n- e2f3: Rook move, but doesn't help\n- e2d3: Rook move, but doesn't address the knight\n- g1g2: Rook move to protect the king\n- h5h6: Pawn push, but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- c4c5: Pawn push, but allows the knight to capture b2\n- f2f3: Pawn push to protect the king\n- b2b3: Pawn push to protect against the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on c4 attacking the b2 pawn. If the knight captures b2, White will lose a pawn and the knight will be well-placed.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to push the b-pawn to protect against the knight capture:\n\n```\nb2b3\n```"
