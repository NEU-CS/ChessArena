When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on b4 is attacking White's pawn on e3. White's queen on b3 is protecting it.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b3c4: Moves queen to defend e3 pawn while attacking the knight\n- b3d5: Moves queen to active square\n- a1a5: Rook move attacking the pawn\n- e3e4: Pawn push creating space\n- d1f1: Rook move protecting the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the safety of White's king and the defense of the e3 pawn. The move b3c4 addresses both issues by:\n- Defending the e3 pawn\n- Attacking the knight on f6\n- Opening a line for White's bishop on d2\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb3c4\n```"
