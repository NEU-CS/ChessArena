When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop pair, knight, pawns. Black has a bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (g1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on g5 is very active. Black's bishop on g7 is also active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's bishop on g4 is eyeing the h2 pawn. White's knight on f3 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g5h6: Bishop takes h6 pawn - but there's no pawn on h6\n- g5f6: Bishop takes f6 pawn - but there's no pawn on f6\n- g5h4: Bishop moves to h4 - but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- g5f4: Bishop moves to f4 - could be interesting\n- f3e5: Knight moves to e5 - centralizes the knight\n- c4d5: Pawn takes d5 pawn - this seems most promising as it opens lines and wins a pawn\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to capture the d5 pawn with the c-pawn. This:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Opens the c-file for White's rook\n- Opens the diagonal for White's bishop on g5\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc4d5\n```"
