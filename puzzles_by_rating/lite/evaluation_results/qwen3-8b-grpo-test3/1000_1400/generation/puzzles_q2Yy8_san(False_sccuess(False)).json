When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on c6 is very active. White's bishop on e2 is well-placed. Black's bishop on b8 and queen on d7 are active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's pawn on g6 is threatening to advance. White's pawn on e3 is blocking the bishop.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c6e5: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- c2e4: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- e3e4: Pawn push creating space\n- c6d4: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- c2g6: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most pressing concern is the pawn on g6 which could advance to g5, opening lines for Black's pieces. The move c2g6 (Bishop to g6) addresses this by:\n- Attacking the g6 pawn\n- Opening the diagonal for White's bishop\n- Preparing potential h2-h4 push\n- Maintaining control over e4 square\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc2g6\n```"
