When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, pawns. Black has a queen, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on c5 is very active. Black's queen on g5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: Black's queen on g5 is eyeing the g2 pawn. White's queen on f2 is protecting it.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c5e7: Bishop takes pawn, but doesn't seem to gain much\n- c5d6: Bishop move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- f2h4: Queen move attacking the h4 pawn\n- b1e4: Knight move attacking the queen\n- b1d3: Knight move developing the knight\n\nThe most promising move is b1e4, attacking the black queen. If the queen moves, White can play Nc3 or Nf3, improving the knight's position. If Black takes the knight with dxe4, White can play Bxg5 winning the queen.\n\nOther moves don't seem to improve White's position as much. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb1e4\n```"
