When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is well-placed at f5, protecting the e4 pawn. Black's king is at d4, close to the e4 pawn.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White's b6 pawn is advanced and could promote if supported. Black's b7 pawn is blocking it. The e4 pawn is under attack by Black's king.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f5g6: Moves king towards the g-pawns but doesn't address the e4 pawn\n- f5f6: Moves king towards the center but doesn't help\n- f5e6: Moves king towards the e4 pawn while also protecting the b6 pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the e4 pawn which is under attack by Black's king. If the e4 pawn falls, White will lose material. Therefore, we need to protect it while also maintaining pressure on the b6 pawn.\n\nf5e6 accomplishes both:\n- Moves the king towards the e4 pawn to protect it\n- Maintains protection of the b6 pawn\n- Opens the possibility of moving to d5 or f5 later\n\nThe other moves don't address the immediate threat to the e4 pawn. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf5e6\n```"
