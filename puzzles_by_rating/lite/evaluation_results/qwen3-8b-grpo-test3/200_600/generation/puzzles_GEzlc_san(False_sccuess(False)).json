When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a Rook, Bishop, Queen, Rook, pawns. Black has a Rook, Bishop, Queen, Rook, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a4, c6, f2, g2, h2. Black has pawns on a5, e4, g7, h7.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on b8 is very active. White's queen on e3 is well-placed. Black's queen on d5 is centralized.\n\n5. Threats: White's rook on b8 is attacking the black rook on g8. White's queen is eyeing the e4 pawn.\n\nLooking at the candidate moves:\n\n- c6c7: This pawn push would open lines for White's pieces and threaten to promote. It also attacks the black queen on d5.\n- e3a7: This queen move attacks the rook on a8 but doesn't seem to gain much.\n- e3b6: This queen move attacks the pawn on c6 but doesn't seem to be the most pressing.\n- c2e2: This rook move defends the e3 queen but isn't necessary yet.\n\nThe most promising move is c6c7 because:\n1. It opens the c-file for White's rook\n2. It threatens to promote the pawn\n3. It attacks the black queen on d5\n4. It creates potential for a discovered attack if the bishop moves\n\nOther moves don't seem to address the immediate opportunities or threats as effectively.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc6c7\n```"
