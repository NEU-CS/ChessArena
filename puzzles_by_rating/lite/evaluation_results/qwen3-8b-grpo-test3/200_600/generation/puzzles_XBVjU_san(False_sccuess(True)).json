When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's queen is on g1 attacking the king.\n\n3. Immediate threats: Black's queen on g1 is attacking White's rook on d1. White's only legal move is d1f1, which moves the rook away from the queen's attack.\n\n4. Positional factors: White's knight on g2 is well-placed. Black's knight on c7 is isolated. White's pawns are slightly better structured.\n\n5. Candidate moves: Only d1f1 is available. This move:\n- Saves the rook from the queen\n- Moves the rook towards the kingside where it can potentially participate in defense\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nThere are no other legal moves, so d1f1 is the only option. While it's not an ideal position for White, this move at least addresses the immediate threat to the rook.\n\n```\nd1f1\n```"
