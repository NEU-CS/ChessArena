Candidate moves:\n- g3f1: Knight move doesn't address the rook threat\n- f2g1: Rook move protects the king but doesn't address the e1 rook\n- f2e1: Rook takes the attacking rook - this seems most pressing\n\nThe most immediate concern is the rook on e1 attacking White's rook. Taking it with f2e1:\n- Removes the attacker\n- Opens the e-file for White's rook\n- Maintains control of the second rank\n\nThe other moves don't address the immediate threat.

There are no other legal moves listed, so this must be the correct choice.\n\n```\ng3f1\n```"
