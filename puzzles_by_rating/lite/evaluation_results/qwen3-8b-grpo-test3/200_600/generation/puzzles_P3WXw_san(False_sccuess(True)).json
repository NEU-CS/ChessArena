When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black has a rook on d1 attacking White's rook on c4. White's rook on b4 is also under attack by the black rook.\n\n4. Legal moves: Only e2f1 or e2d1 (king moves). Both moves get the king out of potential checks and protect the rook on d1.\n\n5. Evaluation:\n- e2d1: Moves the king towards the center but still leaves the king exposed\n- e2f1: Moves the king towards the corner, but might be safer from potential checks\n\nThe more pressing concern is the attack on the rook on d1. Both moves protect it, but e2d1 also opens the possibility of castling queenside later if the position allows.\n\nAfter careful consideration, e2d1 seems the more flexible option as it:\n- Protects the rook\n- Maintains some central control\n- Doesn't leave the king in a completely exposed position\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne2d1\n```"
