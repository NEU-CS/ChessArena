When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on b1 is very active. Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by its own pawn on d7.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on h4 is eyeing the g6 pawn. White's queen on d2 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f5g4: Capturing the pawn with the knight seems most pressing. It opens the f-file for Black's rook and removes a pawn from White's knight.\n- f6h6: Moving the knight to h6 could be useful for defense.\n- e6e5: Pushing the pawn to gain space.\n- f7h6: Moving the knight to h6.\n\nThe most concrete move is f5g4, capturing the pawn. This:\n- Opens the f-file for Black's rook\n- Removes a pawn from White's knight\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf5g4\n```"
