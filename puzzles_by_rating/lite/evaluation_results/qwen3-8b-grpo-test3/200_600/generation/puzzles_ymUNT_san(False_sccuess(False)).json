When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+B+Q+R vs Black's R+Q+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on d4 is very active. White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f6e4: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- f6d5: Knight move centralizing\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating luft for the king\n- d6d5: Pawn break freeing the knight\n- f6h5: Knight move attacking the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on g3 and the bishop on d4. The knight on f6 is well-placed but needs to address these threats.\n\nf6e4 seems most promising:\n- Attacks the bishop on d4\n- If White takes the knight with Bxe4, Black can play dxe4\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play Nxd5\n- Also prepares potential Nc6 or Nd2 ideas\n\nOther moves:\n- g7g6 creates luft but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- d6d5 is too slow\n- f6h5 doesn't help much\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6e4\n```"
