When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and pawns (White has B+B+P+P vs Black's R+P+P). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on d2, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on h6 is attacking the g7 pawn. White's pawns on g4/h4 are advanced and could be dangerous.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4f5: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- e4g2: Bishop move attacking the rook\n- e4c2: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- e8e5: Rook move centralizing\n- g6g5: Pawn move creating space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's bishop on h6. If it remains there, it will eventually capture the g7 pawn and open lines for White's pieces.\n\nThe best move is to play e4f5, moving the bishop to defend the g7 pawn while also opening a line for Black's rook. This move:\n- Defends the g7 pawn\n- Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over the f5 square\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new problems (like e8e5 which would leave the king exposed).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne4f5\n```"
