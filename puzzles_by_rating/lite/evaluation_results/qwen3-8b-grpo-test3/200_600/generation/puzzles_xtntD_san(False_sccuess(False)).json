When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on f2 is attacking White's pawn on g2. White needs to address this immediate threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e1e2: Moves the rook to defend the g2 pawn\n- f3e2: Bishop move that also defends g2\n- g2g3: Pawn move that creates a shelter for the king\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threat\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on f2 attacking g2. Both e1e2 and f3e2 address this while also developing pieces.\n\nf3e2 seems better because:\n1. It develops the bishop to a more active square\n2. It still defends the g2 pawn\n3. It doesn't block the rook's movement\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf3e2\n```"
