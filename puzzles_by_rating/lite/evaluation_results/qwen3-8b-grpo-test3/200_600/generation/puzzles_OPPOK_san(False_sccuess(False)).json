When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a Rook, Bishop, pawns. Black has a Rook, Bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on c6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a2, b2, g2, h2. Black has pawns on a7, b7, c5, f5. The c-pawn is isolated and vulnerable.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's Rook on h6 is very active. Bishop on f3 is well-placed. Black's Rook is missing from the board.\n\n5. Threats: White's Rook on h6 is attacking the h7 pawn. Black's pawn on f5 is threatening to advance.\n\nLooking at the candidate moves:\n\n- h6h8: Rook lift, but doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately\n- h6h7: Captures the pawn, but allows Black's f-pawn to advance\n- h6g6: Moves Rook to defend the g-pawn\n- f3c6: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Black's king to capture the Rook\n- f3h5: Bishop move, but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- f3d5: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3g4: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3e4: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3e2: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3d1: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- g1h1/g1f1: King moves, but don't address immediate concerns\n- h2h3/g2g3/b2b3/a2a3/h2h4/g2g4/b2b4/a2a4: Pawn moves\n\nThe most pressing concern is the h7 pawn which is undefended. If we take it with h6h7, we gain material and open the h-file for our Rook. While it allows f5 to advance, we can deal with that later.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh6h7\n```"
