When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+Q). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on c1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on d2 is eyeing the d-file. Black's rook on b8 is under attack by White's bishop on b7.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b8b7: Capturing the bishop with the rook seems most pressing\n- b6e3: Knight move attacking the queen\n- a2a1: Rook move promoting the pawn\n- f7f5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most urgent concern is the bishop on b7 attacking the rook on b8. If we don't address this, White can win the rook.\n\nAfter b8b7:\n- If White takes the rook with Bxb7, we can play a2a1 promoting the pawn\n- If White doesn't take, we've eliminated the bishop threat\n\nOther moves don't address the immediate threat to the rook. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb8b7\n```"
