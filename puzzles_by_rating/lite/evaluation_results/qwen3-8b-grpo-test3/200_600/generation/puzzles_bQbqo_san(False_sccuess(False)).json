When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on b1 is attacking White's rook on e5. White's queen on h6 is close to Black's king.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h6c1: Queen takes rook on b1\n- e5e1: Rook takes rook on e1\n- f3d1: Bishop move (but this seems passive)\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on White's rook on e5. If we don't address this, Black could win the rook.\n\nBetween the options:\n- h6c1 wins the rook immediately\n- e5e1 also wins the rook but leaves White's queen exposed\n- f3d1 doesn't address the immediate threat\n\nh6c1 is the most forcing move, winning the rook while also protecting White's rook on e5. After this move, White will be up a rook for a bishop.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh6c1\n```"
