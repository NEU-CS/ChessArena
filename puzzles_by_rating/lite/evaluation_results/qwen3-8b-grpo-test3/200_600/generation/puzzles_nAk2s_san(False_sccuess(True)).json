When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's pawn on g2 is attacking White's knight on g3. If the knight moves, the pawn will capture it.\n\n4. Available moves: Only h1h2 is legal (king move).\n\nThis is a critical position where White is in immediate danger:\n- The g2 pawn is attacking the knight\n- If the knight moves, g2xg3 wins the knight\n- White has no other pieces that can defend the knight\n- Moving the king to h2:\n  - Gets the king out of potential checks\n  - Maintains protection of the knight\n  - Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nThere are no other legal moves, so h1h2 is the only option. While it doesn't solve all problems, it's the most resilient move that maintains some defensive resources.\n\n```\nh1h2\n```"
