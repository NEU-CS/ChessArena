When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight on h8, bishop on c4, queen on f3, pawns. Black has a queen on e7, knight on g6, bishop on h4, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (g1). Black's king is on e8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on h4 is eyeing White's pawn on g2. White's knight on h8 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h8f7: Knight takes pawn, but allows Black's knight to capture the knight\n- h8g6: Knight takes knight, winning the knight\n- c4g8: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- f3f6: Queen move, but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- h1g1: Rook move to protect the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h8. If we don't capture the knight on g6, it will likely move to a better square. The move h8g6 (knight takes knight) wins the knight outright and maintains the initiative.\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh8g6\n```"
