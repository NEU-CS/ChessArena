When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's R+B+P). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on e4 is eyeing the e6 bishop. White's rook on e1 is pressuring the e-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b3e6: Capturing the pawn with the bishop\n- f6e5: Knight move attacking the queen\n- a2e2: Rook move attacking the queen\n- d6d5: Pawn push creating space\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating luft for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on e4. Several moves address this:\n\na) f6e5 - Knight takes the queen\nb) a2e2 - Rook takes the queen\nc) f6d4 - Knight move attacking the queen\n\nAll three options capture the queen, but a2e2 (Rook takes) seems most straightforward as it:\n- Captures the queen\n- Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e6\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na2e2\n```"
