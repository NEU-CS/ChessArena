When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Bishop, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b1. Black's king is on e8.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on h6 is attacking the g7 pawn. White's knight on g3 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h8h6: Capturing the rook with the rook\n- g7h6: Capturing the rook with the bishop\n- b5d3: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- f7g6: Pawn capture opening the f-file\n- e6e5: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on h6. Both h8h6 and g7h6 capture it, but g7h6 (bishop capture) is better because:\n- It opens the g-file for Black's rook\n- The bishop remains active on h6\n- It maintains control over the e5 square\n\nOther moves don't address the immediate threat to the g7 pawn or the exposed white king.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng7h6\n```"
