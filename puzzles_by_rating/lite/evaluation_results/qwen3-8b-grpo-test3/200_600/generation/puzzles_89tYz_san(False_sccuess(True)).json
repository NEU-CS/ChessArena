Pawn structure: White's pawns are advanced (h5, g4) while Black's pawn is isolated at b3. The h-pawn is particularly dangerous as it's close to promotion.\n\n3. King positions: White's king is well-placed at g6, supporting the pawns. Black's king is at d2, somewhat distant from the pawns.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g6h7: Moves king towards the h-pawn but doesn't help immediately\n- g6g7: Similar to above\n- g6f7: Moves king towards the center\n- g6h6: Moves king towards the h-pawn\n- g6f6: Moves king towards the center\n- g6g5: Moves king towards the g-pawn\n- g6f5: Moves king towards the center\n- h5h6: Advances the h-pawn - this is very tempting as it threatens promotion\n- g4g5: Advances the g-pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the h-pawn. If we play h5h6, the pawn is one square from promotion. Black's king is too far away to stop it (it would take 3 moves for the king to reach h1). Therefore, h5h6 is the most forcing move that creates immediate threats.\n\n```\nh5h6\n```"

Black has no way to stop this:\n\n- After h6h7, if Black plays Kd3, White plays h7h8=Q\n- If Black tries to capture the pawn with Kd3xh7, White plays Kf7-g6 and the g-pawn will promote\n\nAll other moves give Black time to organize defense.
