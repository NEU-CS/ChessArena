Candidate moves:\n- h1g1: Moves the king towards the center but doesn't address the knight threat\n- f1f2: Moves the rook away from the knight while maintaining protection of the king\n\nThe knight on g2 is a serious threat - if it captures the rook (Nxf1), White would lose the rook. Therefore, we must move the rook to safety.\n\nf1f2 is the only move that:\n- Gets the rook out of attack\n- Maintains protection of the king\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nh1g1 would leave the rook vulnerable to the knight.
