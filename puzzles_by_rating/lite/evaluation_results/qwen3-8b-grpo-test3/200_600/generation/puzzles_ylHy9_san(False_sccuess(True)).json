When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety:\n- White king is exposed on g1\n- Black king is on g8\n- Black rook on e1 is attacking White's queen\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black rook on e1 is attacking White's queen on a1\n- White has only one legal move: a1e1 (queen takes rook)\n\n4. Consequences of a1e1:\n- White queen captures the rook\n- Black bishop on d2 is attacking White's bishop on f3\n- After a1e1, White's queen will be on e1 protecting the king\n\n5. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves available\n\nThe only possible move is to capture the rook with the queen. This removes the immediate threat to the queen and also opens the e-file for White's rook (if one were present). While it exposes the queen to the bishop on d2, there's no better option.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na1e1\n```"
