When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety:\n- White king is exposed on a1\n- Black king is on h8\n- Black queen on e1 is attacking White's knight on c6\n\n3. Immediate threats:\n- Black queen on e1 is attacking the knight on c6\n- White knight has only two legal moves: c3e1 or c3c1\n\n4. Evaluating the knight moves:\n- c3e1: Moves the knight to e1, capturing the black queen\n  - After this, White would have knight + queen vs rook + bishop\n  - White would be up a minor piece\n- c3c1: Moves the knight to c1\n  - Doesn't address the threat to the knight\n  - Black queen remains on e1 attacking the knight\n\n5. Conclusion:\n- c3e1 is the only move that:\n  - Saves the knight\n  - Captures the black queen\n  - Leaves White with a material advantage\n\nThe best move is clearly c3e1, capturing the queen while saving the knight.\n\n```\nc3e1\n```"
