When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on c7.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on e4 is well-placed. White's rook on d2 is active. Black's rook on f8 and bishop on e5 are also active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's rook on d4 is attacking White's rook on d2. White needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d2d8: Rook lift, but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- d2d4: Capturing the rook seems most pressing\n- e4f6: Knight move, but doesn't help\n- e3h6: Bishop move, but irrelevant\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on d4 attacking our rook on d2. If we don't address this, we'll lose the rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the rook with:\n\n```\nd2d4\n```"
