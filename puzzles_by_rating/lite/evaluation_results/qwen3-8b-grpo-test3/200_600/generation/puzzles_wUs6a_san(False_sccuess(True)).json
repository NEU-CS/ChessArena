When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on h4 is attacking the knight on h5. White's bishop on h6 is eyeing the g7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h5f6: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- e7g5: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- f7f6: Pawn move protecting the e5 pawn\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating luft for the king\n- d6d5: Pawn move opening lines for the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h5 being attacked by the queen. If we don't address this, White can capture the knight with Qxh5.\n\nThe best move is to move the knight to f6, where it:\n- Attacks the bishop on h6\n- Moves away from the queen's attack\n- Maintains control over e4\n- Doesn't expose the knight further\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh5f6\n```"
