When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, pawns. Black has a knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f3. Black's king is on e7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, f4, g5. Black has pawns on a6, c6, f5. The g5 pawn is advanced and could be dangerous.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on h5 is very active. Black's knight on f1 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- h5e8: Bishop takes rook (but there's no rook on e8)\n- h5f7: Bishop move, but doesn't accomplish much\n- h5g6: Bishop move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- h5g4: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- f3g2: King move, but exposes to knight checks\n- f3f2: King move, but doesn't help\n- f3e2: King move, but doesn't help\n- g5g6: Pawn push, creating a passed pawn and opening lines for the bishop\n- a3a4: Pawn move, but doesn't help\n\nThe most promising move is g5g6, advancing the pawn and creating a passed pawn. This:\n- Opens the g-file for the bishop\n- Creates a potential passed pawn on g6\n- Limits black's pawn structure\n- Doesn't weaken white's position\n\nOther moves either don't help or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5g6\n```"
