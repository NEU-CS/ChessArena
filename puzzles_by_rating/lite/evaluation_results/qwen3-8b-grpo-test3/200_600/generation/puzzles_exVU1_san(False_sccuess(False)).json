Candidate moves:\n- c4b5: Moves king towards the pawn but doesn't accomplish much\n- c4d4: Moves king towards the knight\n- c4d3: Captures the knight! This is the most forcing move\n- c4c3: Moves king towards the pawn\n- c4b3: Moves king towards the pawn\n- d5d4: Advances the pawn but leaves it vulnerable\n\nThe best move is clearly c4d3, capturing the knight. This:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the d-file for Black's king to support the d-pawn\n- Maintains control over the pawn\n- Doesn't expose Black's king\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses.
