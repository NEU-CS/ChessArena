When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White: King, pawns (a2, d6, g6), queen (h6)\n- Black: King, pawns (a7, b6, f7), rook (d7), bishop (e6)\nMaterial is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety:\n- White king is exposed on g2\n- Black king is on f8, relatively safe\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White has passed pawn on d6\n- Black has pawn on b6 controlling d6\n- White's g6 pawn is advanced but isolated\n\n4. Piece activity:\n- White queen is very active on h6\n- Black rook on d7 is well-placed\n- Black bishop on e6 is controlling important squares\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f8g8: Moves king towards the corner\n- f8e8: Moves king towards the center\n\nThe more pressing concern is White's queen on h6, which is eyeing the h7 pawn and could potentially create threats against the Black king. Moving the king towards the center with f8e8 seems more flexible, as it:\n- Gets the king out of the corner\n- Maintains options to move towards either side of the board\n- Doesn't leave the king more exposed than it is\n\nf8g8 would be more passive and doesn't improve the king's position as much.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf8e8\n```"
