When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is also uncastled (e1).\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on h6 is attacking the g7 pawn. White's knight on f3 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves: Only h7g6 is available. This move:\n   - Captures the knight on f3\n   - Opens the h-file for Black's rook\n   - Removes a defender from f3\n   - Creates a passed pawn on g6\n\nAfter h7g6:\n- White can play Qxg7, but Black can respond with Nf6\n- White's bishop on d3 is now more active\n- Black can consider castling queenside soon\n\nThis is the only reasonable move in the position. All other moves would be worse or illegal.\n\n```\nh7g6\n```"
