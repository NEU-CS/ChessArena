Consequences of d3d1:\n- Captures the rook\n- Moves queen to d1 where it's protected by the knight on c5\n- After this move:\n  - White will have queen + knight vs bishop\n  - White's pawn structure is slightly better\n  - White can follow up with moves like Nxe6 or Bf3\n\n5. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves available\n\nThe only possible move is to capture the rook with the queen. This maintains material equality while removing a dangerous attacker from the board. White's pieces are well-placed to defend the king and launch counterplay.\n\n```\nd3d1\n```"
