When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a knight on e7 that's very active.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on e7 is attacking the queen on d8. White's queen on h7 is attacking the rook on g8.\n\n4. Legal moves: Only h8h7 is available (king move).\n\nThe only legal move is to move the king from h8 to h7. This:\n- Gets the king out of potential checks\n- Moves away from the edge of the board\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nThere are no other options - the knight on e7 is attacking the queen, and the queen on h7 is attacking the rook. All other pieces are immobilized by the position.\n\nTherefore, the only possible move is:\n\n```\nh8h7\n```"
