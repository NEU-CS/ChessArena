When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on c1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on g8 is attacking Black's rook on e7. White's rook on f1 is eyeing the f-file.\n\n4. Legal moves: Only d8f8 is available (queen move). This move:\n   - Moves the queen to defend the rook on e7\n   - Opens the d-file for Black's rook on d8\n   - Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther considerations:\n- White's queen is very active on g8\n- Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on d6\n- White's pawn on d5 is isolated but advanced\n\nGiven the material disadvantage and the need to defend the rook, d8f8 seems like the only reasonable move. It at least addresses the immediate threat to the rook while maintaining some coordination between Black's pieces.\n\n```\nd8f8\n```"
