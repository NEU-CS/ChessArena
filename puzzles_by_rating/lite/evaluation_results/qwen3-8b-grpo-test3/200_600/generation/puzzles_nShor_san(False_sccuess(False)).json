When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on g4 is eyeing the h3 pawn. White's pawn on e3 is under attack by Black's knight on g6.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e3e4: Pushing the pawn to gain space and protect the e3 pawn\n- g2f3: Capturing the bishop and opening the g-file for White's rook\n- e1c3: Developing the rook to a more active position\n- b2c3: Developing the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on g4 attacking h3 and the knight on g6 attacking e3. \n\ng2f3 (capturing the bishop) seems most urgent as:\n1. It removes the bishop from g4\n2. Opens the g-file for White's rook\n3. Maintains control over e3\n4. If Black recaptures with hxg3, White can play Qxg3\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng2f3\n```"
