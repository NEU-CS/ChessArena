When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, rook, pawns. Black has a rook, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on a6.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, b2, f4, g2, h2. Black has no pawns except the a-pawn.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on c2 is very active. Rook on b2 is well-placed. Black's rook on e8 is passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b2e5: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- b2f6: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- b2d4: Bishop move centralizing\n- c2c8: Rook move attacking the rook\n- f4f5: Pawn push gaining space\n- a3a4: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most promising move is c2c8, attacking the black rook. This:\n- Wins the rook if it doesn't move\n- If the rook moves, white can play b2e5 or f4f5\n- Maintains pressure on the e-file\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc2c8\n```"
