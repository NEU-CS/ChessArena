When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a2,b2,c3,f2,g2,h3. Black has pawns on a7,b7,d5,e6,g7. The d5 pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on e1 is well-placed. Black's rook on e8 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e1e5: Rook move attacking the e5 pawn\n- e1e4: Rook move attacking the d5 pawn\n- g2g4: Pawn push creating space for the king\n- f2f4: Pawn push controlling e5 square\n- b2b4: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. While none of the moves directly address this, f2f4 seems most promising as it:\n- Opens the f-file for White's rook\n- Controls the e5 square\n- Creates potential for f4-f5 pawn push later\n- Doesn't weaken any pawns\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf2f4\n```"
