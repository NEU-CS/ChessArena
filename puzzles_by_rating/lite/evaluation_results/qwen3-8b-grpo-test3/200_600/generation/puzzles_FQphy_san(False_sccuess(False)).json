When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+Q+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on g5 is attacking the pawn on f6. White's queen on e2 is eyeing the e-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d4f6: Bishop takes pawn, but allows White's bishop to capture the knight\n- d4e5: Bishop move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b6c5: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- g7g6: Pawn move, kicking the bishop\n- f7f6: Pawn move, protecting the e5 square\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's bishop on g5 attacking the f6 pawn. If we don't address this, White can play Bxf6 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is g7g6, which:\n- Kicks the bishop from g5\n- Opens the g-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over f5\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng7g6\n```"
