When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+N+B, Black has B). White has a knight on g6 that's very active.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on g6 is attacking the pawn on e7. White's queen on h5 is eyeing the h7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8f8: Castles kingside, getting the king to safety\n- e7f6: Moves the pawn to defend the e7 pawn and open the e7-bishop\n\nLooking deeper:\n- If e7f6, White can play Nxe7 winning the pawn\n- If e8f8, White can play Nxe7 winning the pawn anyway\n- Both moves lose the e7 pawn\n- After either move, White's knight on g6 is very strong\n\nThe main difference is that e8f8 at least gets the king to safety while e7f6 leaves the king in the center. Therefore, castling kingside is the more principled move despite the material loss.\n\n```\ne8f8\n```"
