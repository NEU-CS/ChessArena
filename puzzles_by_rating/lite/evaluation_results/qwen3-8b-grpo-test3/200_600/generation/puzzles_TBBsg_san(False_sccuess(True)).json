White's only legal move is to move the king to f1.\n\n4. Consequences: If White doesn't move the king, the rook on e1 would be captured by the queen. Moving to f1:\n   - Gets the king out of potential checks\n   - Protects the e1 rook\n   - Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\n5. Alternatives: There are no other legal moves available. All other pieces are either blocked or would leave the king in check.\n\nThe only reasonable move is to move the king to f1 to save the rook and maintain the position. \n\n```\ne1f1\n```"
