When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on h2, also exposed.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on g1 is eyeing the g-file. White's bishop on f3 is protecting the g2 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f7f5: Pawn push to gain space and protect the e6 pawn\n- e6e5: Pawn push to open lines for the rook\n- c4e2: Bishop move attacking the rook\n- a2e2: Rook move attacking the bishop\n- f8g8: Rook move to protect the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on g1. If it advances, it could be dangerous. The move f8g8 (Rook to g8) would:\n- Protect the king from potential checks\n- Prevent the rook from advancing further\n- Maintain control of the g-file\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf8g8\n```"
