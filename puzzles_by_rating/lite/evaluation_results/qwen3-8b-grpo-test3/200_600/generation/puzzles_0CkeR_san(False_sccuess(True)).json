When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety:\n- White king is exposed on a1\n- Black king is on h8, relatively safe\n\n3. Threats:\n- White's rook on e8 is attacking Black's rook on f8\n- Black's rook on f4 is attacking White's pawn on g2\n- White's queen on g8 is very active\n\n4. Candidate moves:\nOnly legal move is f4f8 (Rook takes Rook)\n\nThis move:\n- Captures White's rook\n- Opens the f-file for Black's rook\n- Removes the immediate threat to Black's rook\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n\nAfter f4f8, White's queen on g8 is still a strong piece, but Black will have won the exchange and can try to push pawns or activate the rook.\n\nThere are no better alternatives as this is the only legal move.\n\n```\nf4f8\n```"
