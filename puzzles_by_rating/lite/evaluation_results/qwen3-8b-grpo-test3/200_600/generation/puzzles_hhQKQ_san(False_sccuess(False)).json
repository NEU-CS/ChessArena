When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and pawns (White has Rook, Bishop, pawns; Black has Rook, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has an advanced pawn on f6 that's isolated and potentially weak.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on d1 is well-placed. Black's rook on e8 is passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e8e7: Activates the rook and prepares to defend the e-file\n- e8e6: Similar to e8e7 but less flexible\n- h7h6: Creates space for the king and prevents potential g2-g4 ideas\n- g7g6: Similar to h7h6\n- b7b5: Pawn break to open lines for the rook\n- c6c5: Pawn break to open lines for the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's advanced f6 pawn which could become a target. Also, Black needs to activate his rook.\n\nThe best move is e8e7, which:\n- Activates the rook\n- Defends the e-file\n- Prepares potential rook lifts (Re7-e1)\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new problems (like b7b5 which could open lines for White's rook).\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
