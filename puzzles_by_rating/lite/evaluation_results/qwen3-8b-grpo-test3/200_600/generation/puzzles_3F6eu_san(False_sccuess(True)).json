When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's R+B+N+P). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (g8).\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on h5 is attacking Black's pawn on g6. White's bishop on h4 is eyeing the h8 rook.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g6h4: Capturing the bishop with the knight\n- g6e5: Moving the knight to a central square\n- c5e3: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- f7f5: Pawn push creating space\n- d7d5: Pawn push opening the center\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h5 attacking the g6 pawn. If we don't address this, White can play Nxf6 or Nxg7.\n\nThe best move is to capture the bishop with g6h4, which:\n- Removes the bishop from h4\n- Opens the h-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e5\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems (like f7f5 which weakens e5).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng6h4\n```"
