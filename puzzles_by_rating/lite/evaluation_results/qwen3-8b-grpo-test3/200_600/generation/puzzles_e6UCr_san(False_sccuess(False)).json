When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Pawn structure: White's a-pawn is advanced to a6, but it's blocked by Black's king. Black's f-pawn is isolated but advanced.\n\n3. King positions: White's king is well-placed at b5, supporting the a-pawn. Black's king is at a7, protecting the a-pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b5c6: Moves king towards the f-pawn\n- b5c5: Moves king towards the center\n- b5a5: Moves king towards the a-pawn\n- b5c4: Moves king towards the center\n- b5b4: Moves king towards the center\n- b5a4: Moves king towards the a-pawn\n\nThe best move is b5c6. This:\n- Moves the king closer to Black's f-pawn\n- Maintains control over the a-pawn\n- Opens the possibility of supporting White's a-pawn if it advances\n- Doesn't allow Black's king to become too active\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or could be worse (like b5a5 which would allow Black's king to become more active).\n\n```\nb5c6\n```"
