When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e3. Black's king is on d5, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a4, d4, f2, g2, h2. Black has pawns on a5, c6, d6, g5, h6. The d4 pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e3f3: Moves king towards the pawns but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e3d3: Moves king towards the center but still exposed\n- e3f2: Moves king towards the pawns but doesn't help\n- e3e2: Moves king towards the center\n- e3d2: Moves king towards the center\n- g4f5: Pawn capture that opens lines for White's pawns\n- h4h5: Pawn advance that could be useful\n- g4g5: Pawn advance that could be useful\n\nThe most promising moves are g4f5, h4h5, and g4g5. \n\ng4f5 stands out because:\n1. It captures a pawn\n2. It opens the g-file for White's pawns\n3. It creates space for White's king to move\n4. It weakens Black's pawn structure\n\nThe other moves don't address the immediate needs of the position. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng4f5\n```"
