When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on e1. Black's king is on h6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on c7 is attacking White's rook on g7. White needs to address this immediately.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7g8: Rook move, but doesn't address the immediate threat to g7 rook\n- g7f7: Moves rook away from attack but doesn't help defense\n- g7g6: Moves rook towards black king but still leaves it under attack\n- g3g6: Rook move that attacks the pawn and opens lines for White's pieces\n- e1f2: King move that gets out of potential checks and towards safety\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the g7 rook. While none of the moves completely solve this, e1f2 (king move) seems most beneficial as it:\n- Gets the king out of potential checks\n- Moves towards safer territory\n- Doesn't weaken any pawns\n- Maintains all options for the rooks\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne1f2\n```"
