When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on h4 is eyeing the g2 pawn. Black's queen on f5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d4e5: Queen move attacking the pawn\n- g2e4: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- d6d7: Pawn push attacking the rook\n- c7f7: Rook move attacking the bishop\n- d1d3: Rook move defending the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h4. If it moves to g2, it would capture the pawn and open lines for Black's pieces. Therefore, we need to address this threat.\n\nThe best move is g2e4, which:\n- Moves the bishop to e4 where it's safer\n- Attacks the knight on h4\n- Opens the diagonal for the white bishop\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\ng2e4\n```"
