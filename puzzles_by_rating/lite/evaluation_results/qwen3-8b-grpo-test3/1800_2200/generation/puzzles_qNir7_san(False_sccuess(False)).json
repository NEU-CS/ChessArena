When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on e3. Black's king is on c3, also exposed.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on f2 and h4. Black has pawns on a3, c3, and f4. The f4 pawn is isolated and vulnerable.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's Rook on g5 is very active. Black's Rook on c4 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g5g8: Rook move to the back rank, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- g5g7: Rook move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- g5g6: Rook move, but doesn't help\n- g5h5: Rook move, but doesn't help\n- g5f5: Rook move, but doesn't help\n- g5e5: Rook move, but doesn't help\n- g5d5: Rook move, but doesn't help\n- g5c5: Rook move, attacking the pawn on c3\n- g5b5: Rook move, attacking the pawn on a3\n- g5a5: Rook move, attacking the pawn on a3\n- e3f4: King move, capturing the f4 pawn\n- e3e2: King move, but doesn't help\n- f2f3: Pawn move, creating a passed pawn\n- f2f4: Pawn move, opening lines for the Rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the f4 pawn, which is isolated and vulnerable. If White captures it with e3f4, it will open lines for the Rook and remove a potential threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3f4\n```"
