When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+B+Q vs Black's N+B+Q). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on e5 is very active. Black's knight on b8 is inactive.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on e5 is eyeing the d7 pawn. White's queen on e2 is protecting the knight.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b8c6: Develops the knight and protects d5 pawn\n- b8d7: Moves knight towards the center\n- d5d4: Pushes the pawn to gain space\n- e7e6: Opens the diagonal for the bishop\n- f7f5: Gains space in the center\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e5. If we don't address it, White could play Nxd6 or Nf3.\n\nb8c6 seems most flexible:\n- Develops the knight\n- Protects d5 pawn\n- Doesn't block the e-pawn\n- Maintains options for castling\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- b8d7 blocks the e-pawn\n- d5d4 weakens e4 pawn\n- e7e6 doesn't address the knight\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb8c6\n```"
