When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on h6 is very active. Black's knight on h5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 pawn. Black's knight on h5 is near White's king.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- h6g7: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Black's knight to capture the bishop\n- c4f7: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- g3g7: Queen takes pawn, but allows Black's knight to capture the queen\n- c3d5: Knight move, centralizing the knight\n- d1d7: Rook move, attacking the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. The move f2f4 would:\n- Create a pawn shield for the king\n- Open the f-file for White's rook\n- Gain space in the center\n- Prevent Black's knight from moving to f3\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf2f4\n```"
