When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+Q). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on g6 is attacking the pawn on f7. White's knight on h5 is also a threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b4e7: Bishop takes pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b4d6: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- b4c5: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- b4c3: Bishop takes pawn, but doesn't address threats\n- b4a3: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- b4d2: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- b4e1: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- h7h6: Pawn move, creates luft for the king\n- e5e4: Pawn push, but doesn't address threats\n- h7h5: Pawn move, but doesn't help\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on g6 attacking f7. None of the moves directly address this threat. However, h7h6 (h7h6) creates an escape square for the king if White's queen captures on f7.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to create luft for the king:\n\n```\nh7h6\n```"
