When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on a2. Black's king is on g7.\n\n3. Threats: Black has a rook on c1 attacking White's rook on c3. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c3c2: Moves the rook to defend the king\n- c3b3: Moves the rook to defend the king\n- e2e4: Pawn push, but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- c5d7: Knight move, but doesn't help\n- a2b3: Pawn move that could help defend the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on c1 attacking the rook on c3. If we don't defend it, Black could win the rook.\n\nBoth c3c2 and c3b3 defend the king and protect the rook. c3b3 seems better because:\n- It keeps the rook more active\n- It doesn't block the pawn on b2\n- It maintains control over the c-file\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc3b3\n```"
