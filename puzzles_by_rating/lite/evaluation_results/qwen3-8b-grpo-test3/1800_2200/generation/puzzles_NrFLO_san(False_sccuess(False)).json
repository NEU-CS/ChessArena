When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and king. White has a king, pawns on d6, h6, and a passed pawn on c5. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is on d7. White's king is on g5. Both kings are active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on d6, h6, and c5. The d6 pawn is isolated and could be a target. The h6 pawn is advanced but not yet promoting.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7h8: Bishop move to h8 - doesn't seem helpful\n- g7f8: Bishop move to f8 - also not helpful\n- g7h6: Captures the h6 pawn - this seems most promising as it removes a pawn and opens the h-file for Black's bishop\n- g7f6: Bishop move to f6 - could be useful to control the pawn\n- g7e5: Bishop move to e5 - controls the pawn\n- g7d4: Bishop move to d4 - attacks the c5 pawn\n- g7c3: Bishop move to c3 - attacks the c5 pawn\n- g7b2: Bishop move to b2 - not helpful\n- g7a1: Bishop move to a1 - not helpful\n- d7e8: King move to e8 - too passive\n- d7d8: King move to d8 - too passive\n- d7c8: King move to c8 - too passive\n- d7c6: King move to c6 - this is interesting as it attacks the d6 pawn\n\nThe most active moves are g7h6 (capturing the pawn) and d7c6 (attacking the d6 pawn). \n\ng7h6 seems more immediate as it wins a pawn and opens lines for Black's pieces. After this move:\n- White's h-pawn is gone\n- Black's bishop can potentially attack the c5 pawn\n- White's king is exposed on g5\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng7h6\n```"
