When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on b8.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on f7 is attacking Black's rook on f8. White's bishop on g5 is eyeing the h6 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f8f7: Capturing the rook with the rook\n- h4g6: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- d2e1: Bishop move attacking the king\n- Other moves seem less relevant\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on f7 attacking the rook on f8. If we don't address this, White can capture our rook.\n\nf8f7 seems forced - we must capture the rook or lose it. After this move:\n- We capture the rook\n- White's bishop on g5 is still a threat, but we can deal with it later\n- Our knight on h4 is well-placed\n- Our bishop on d2 is eyeing the e1 square\n\nOther moves don't address the immediate threat to our rook. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf8f7\n```"
