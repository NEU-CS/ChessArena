When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on b1.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on f7 is attacking Black's rook on e8. White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e7e8: Moves the king away from the h-file\n- e7f7: Captures the bishop\n- e7e6: Moves the king towards the center\n- e2e6: Moves the rook to defend the e-file\n- b6e6: Moves the bishop to defend the e-file\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on f7 attacking the rook on e8. If we don't address this, White can win the rook.\n\nThe best move is to capture the bishop with e7f7. This:\n- Removes the attacking piece\n- Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over the e8 square\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\ne7f7\n```"
