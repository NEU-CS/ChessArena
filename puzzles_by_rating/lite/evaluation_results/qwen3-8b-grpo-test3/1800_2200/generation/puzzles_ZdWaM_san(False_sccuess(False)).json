When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on c1. Black's king is on c7.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on f2 is attacking White's pawn on e3. White's rook on g7 is under attack by Black's rook on d8.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7g8: Rook promotion? But there's no pawn on g7 to promote.\n- e5f6: Bishop move, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n- a3d6: Queen move, but there's no queen on a3.\n- d1d3: Rook move to defend e3 pawn.\n- c1b1: King move to safety.\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the e3 pawn and the exposed White king. The move d1d3 (Rook d1 to d3) addresses both issues by:\n- Defending the e3 pawn\n- Moving the rook closer to the king for potential defense\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd1d3\n```"
