When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has R+N+Q vs Black's R+Q). Materially, White has a significant advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on g4 is very active. Black's knight on d5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's rook on e5 is attacking the e7 queen. White's queen on g3 is eyeing the h2 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e7g5: Moves the queen to safety while attacking the knight\n- e7f6: Moves the queen to safety\n- d5f4: Knight move attacking the rook\n- f7f5: Pawn move creating space for the knight\n- h7h5: Pawn move creating space for the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the e7 queen. Both e7g5 and e7f6 address this while also developing the queen to more active squares.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is e7g5, which:\n- Moves the queen to safety\n- Attacks the knight on g4\n- Opens the diagonal for the bishop\n- Maintains control over the e5 rook\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7g5\n```"
