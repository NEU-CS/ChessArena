When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N, B, Q, R, pawns; Black has Q, R, N, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on c8.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on e5 is very active. Black's knight on b4 is well-placed. White's pawn on d4 is isolated.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f4e6: Knight move attacking the knight\n- f4d5: Knight move centralizing\n- b4d5: Knight move attacking the knight\n- g6e4: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- f7f5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on e5. Several moves address this:\n\nf4e6 - Attacks the knight and opens the f-file for Black's rook\nb4d5 - Attacks the knight and centralizes the knight\ng6e4 - Bishop move attacking the knight\n\nAfter considering all options, b4d5 seems most flexible:\n- It attacks the knight\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e3\n- Doesn't weaken any pawns\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb4d5\n```"
