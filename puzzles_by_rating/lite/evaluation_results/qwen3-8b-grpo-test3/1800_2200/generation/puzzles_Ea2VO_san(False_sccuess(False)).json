When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed at b3. Black's king is at d6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns at d4 and h4. Black has pawns that could potentially advance.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b3a3: Moves king towards the a-pawns but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b3c2: Moves king towards the center\n- b3b2: Moves king towards the a-pawns\n- h4h5: Advances the h-pawn, creating a passed pawn\n- f3f4: Advances the f-pawn, gaining space\n- c3c4: Advances the c-pawn, challenging black's d5 pawn\n- g2g3/g2g4: Pawn moves that don't seem immediately helpful\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be c3c4 or f3f4. c3c4 would:\n- Open lines for white's pawns\n- Challenge black's d5 pawn\n- Create potential for a c4-d5 exchange\n- Gain space in the center\n\nf3f4 would:\n- Gain space on the kingside\n- Potentially support an h4-h5 push\n- But doesn't address the central situation\n\nAfter considering both options, c3c4 seems more strategically sound as it improves white's central control and creates immediate threats.\n\n```\nc3c4\n```"
