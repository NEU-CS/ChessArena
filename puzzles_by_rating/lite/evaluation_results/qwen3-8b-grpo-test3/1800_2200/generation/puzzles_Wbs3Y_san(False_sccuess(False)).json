White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g2f3: Capturing the knight with the pawn seems most pressing as it removes the immediate threat to the king.\n- f4h6: Bishop move, but doesn't address the knight threat.\n- f4d6: Bishop move, but again doesn't help.\n- a6c8: Queen move, but too slow.\n- e4e5: Pawn push, but doesn't help.\n\nThe most urgent concern is the knight on f3 attacking g2. If we don't address this, Black could play Nxd2 or Nxh2.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the knight with g2f3.\n\n```\ng2f3\n```"
