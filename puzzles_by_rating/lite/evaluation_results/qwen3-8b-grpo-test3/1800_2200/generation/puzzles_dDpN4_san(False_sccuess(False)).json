When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on f3 is well-placed. Black's knight on g4 is very active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's bishop on g4 is attacking the knight on f3. White's bishop on e2 is eyeing the d1 queen.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g4h5: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- g4f3: Capturing the knight would win material\n- f5e4: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- f6d5: Knight move centralizing\n- e8e4: Rook move attacking the knight\n\nThe most forcing move is g4f3, capturing the knight. This:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the f-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n- Doesn't allow White any counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng4f3\n```"
