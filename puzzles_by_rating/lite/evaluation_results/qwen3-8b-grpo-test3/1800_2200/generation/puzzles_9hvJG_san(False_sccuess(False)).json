When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is still in the center on e8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on g4 is eyeing the h2 pawn. White's bishop on g5 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g5d8: Bishop takes rook - but black's rook isn't on d8\n- g5e7: Bishop takes pawn - but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- g5h6: Bishop move - but doesn't threaten anything\n- g5f6: Bishop takes pawn - this wins a pawn\n- e2f4: Rook move - but doesn't seem to help\n- f1f7: Rook move - attacking the pawn\n- d1d6: Queen move - attacking the knight\n\nThe most promising move appears to be g5f6, capturing the pawn with the bishop. This:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Opens the f-file for White's rook\n- Maintains pressure on the kingside\n- Doesn't expose White to any new threats\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
