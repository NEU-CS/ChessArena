When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and two pawns. White has a rook, pawn, and pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e3. Black's king is on d7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on d5 and h2. Black has pawns on e6, g4, h4.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on b6 is very active. Black's knight on b7 is well-placed.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- d7e8/d7d8/d7c8: King moves that don't seem to help\n- d7e7/d7c7: King moves that don't address immediate threats\n- b7d8: Knight move that doesn't accomplish much\n- b7d6: Knight move that attacks the rook\n- b7c5: Knight move that attacks the d5 pawn\n- b7a5: Knight move that doesn't seem useful\n- e6e5: Pawn push that opens lines for Black's pieces\n- h4h3: Pawn push that threatens the h2 pawn\n- g4g3: Pawn push that opens lines for Black's pawns\n\nThe most promising moves are e6e5 and g4g3. e6e5 opens the e-file for Black's rook (if there was one) and gains space. g4g3 opens the g-file and creates a passed pawn.\n\nAfter considering all options, g4g3 seems the most flexible move, creating a passed pawn and opening lines for Black's pieces while maintaining pressure on White's position.\n\n```\ng4g3\n```"
