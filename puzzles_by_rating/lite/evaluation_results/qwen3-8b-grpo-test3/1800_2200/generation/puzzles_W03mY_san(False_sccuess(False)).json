When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's R+B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is exposed on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on h6 is very active. Black's knight on g8 is under attack by the bishop.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h8f7: Rook move attacking the knight\n- g8f7: Knight move capturing the bishop\n- f8f7: Rook move defending the knight\n- d7f6: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- b6e3: Bishop move attacking the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on h6 attacking the knight on g8. If we don't address this, White can play Bxg7 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is g8f7 (Nxf7), capturing the bishop while also opening the g-file for Black's rook. This:\n- Removes the dangerous bishop\n- Opens lines for Black's pieces\n- Maintains control over e5\n- Doesn't weaken Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng8f7\n```"
