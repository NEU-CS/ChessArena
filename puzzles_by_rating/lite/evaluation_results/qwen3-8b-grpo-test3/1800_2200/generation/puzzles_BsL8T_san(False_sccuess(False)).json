When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on g6 is eyeing the g2 pawn. White's bishop on e3 is under attack by the black pawn on d4.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e3h6: Bishop move attacking the h6 pawn\n- e3g5: Bishop move attacking the g5 pawn\n- e3f4: Bishop move attacking the f4 pawn\n- e3d4: Bishop takes pawn - this seems most pressing as it wins material\n- e2g4: Queen move attacking the g4 pawn\n- f1g3: Rook move defending the king\n- a4a5: Pawn push\n\nThe most forcing move is e3d4, capturing the pawn with the bishop. This:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Opens the d-file for White's rook\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Maintains control of the e3 square\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3d4\n```"
