When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a queen and rook for a bishop and knight (White has Q+R vs Black's R+B+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on f1.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on e7 is attacking Black's queen on f7. White's queen on b7 is attacking Black's knight on b6.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f7e7: Capturing the rook with the queen\n- f7g6: Moving the queen to safety\n- b6d5: Moving the knight to defend the queen\n- g7g6: Creating a pawn shield for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the queen. If we don't address this, White can capture the queen with Rxf7.\n\nf7e7 seems forced - it captures the rook and defends the queen. After this:\n- If White takes the queen with Qxb6, Black can play Nxd5\n- If White doesn't take, Black can consider developing counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf7e7\n```"
