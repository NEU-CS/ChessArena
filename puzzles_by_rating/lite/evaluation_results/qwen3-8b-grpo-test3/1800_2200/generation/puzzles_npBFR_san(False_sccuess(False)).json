When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g6. Black's king is on d8.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on g7 is attacking the pawn on h7. White's rook on d3 is eyeing the d-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e1e4: Queen move attacking the rook\n- e1h4: Queen move attacking the queen\n- e1g3: Queen move attacking the king\n- c5d7: Knight move attacking the queen\n- e6e5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on g7. If it's not addressed, White can play Qxh7 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is e1h4, attacking the queen while also preparing to defend the h7 pawn. If White moves the queen, Black can play e6e5 gaining space and preparing to castle.\n\n```\ne1h4\n```"
