When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, pawns. Black has a knight, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on c8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on f3 is well-placed. Black's knight on d7 and bishop on d6 are active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's knight on g4 is eyeing the pawn on e3. White's pawn on f4 is under attack by the knight.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f3g5: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- f3e5: Centralizing the knight\n- b2e5: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- b1c3: Knight development\n- e3e4: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on g4 attacking the e3 pawn. If we don't address this, Black could play Nxe3 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is to develop the knight to c3, which:\n- Protects the e3 pawn\n- Opens the b1-h7 diagonal for the bishop\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Maintains control over the center\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb1c3\n```"
