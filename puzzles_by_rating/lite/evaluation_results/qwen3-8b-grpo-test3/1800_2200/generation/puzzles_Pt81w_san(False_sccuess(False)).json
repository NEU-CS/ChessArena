When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Pawn structure: White's b-pawn is advanced (b5) and could promote if not stopped. Black's f-pawn is blocked by White's king.\n\n3. King positions: Black's king is well-placed near the center. White's king is near the g-pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f5g6: Moves king towards the b-pawn\n- f5f6: Moves king forward\n- f5e6: Moves king towards the b-pawn\n- f5g5: Moves king towards the g-pawn\n- f5e5: Moves king towards the center\n- f5e4: Moves king towards the b-pawn\n- f4f3: Advances the f-pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's b-pawn. If it promotes, White will have two queens. Therefore, we need to stop the b-pawn.\n\nThe best move is f5e4, moving the king towards the b-pawn while also maintaining flexibility. This:\n- Puts the king closer to the b-pawn\n- Doesn't commit to any particular direction yet\n- Maintains control over the e4 square\n\nOther moves either don't address the b-pawn or move the king too far from the action.\n\n```\nf5e4\n```"
