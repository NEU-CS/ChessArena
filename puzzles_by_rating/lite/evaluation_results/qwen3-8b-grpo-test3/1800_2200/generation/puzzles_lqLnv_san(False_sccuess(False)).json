When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is at g1.\n\n3. Threats: White has a rook on b7 attacking the a7 pawn. White's bishop on d3 is eyeing the long diagonal.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8g8 (O-O): Castles kingside to get the king to safety\n- e7g5: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- c6e5: Knight move centralizing\n- d5d4: Pawn push gaining space\n- f7f5: Pawn push creating space for the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is castling to safety. White's rook on b7 is threatening to capture the a7 pawn, and Black's king is still exposed in the center. Therefore, castling kingside (e8g8) is the most important move here.\n\nOther moves can be considered later:\n- After castling, we can think about e7g5 or c6e5\n- The pawn moves (d5d4, f7f5) can wait\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
