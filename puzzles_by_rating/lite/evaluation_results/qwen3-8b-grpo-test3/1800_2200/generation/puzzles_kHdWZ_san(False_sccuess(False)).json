The b4 pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on d4 is very active. Black's knight on c6 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d4e5: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Black's knight to capture the bishop\n- d4c5: Bishop move, but doesn't accomplish much\n- a5b6: Pawn capture, winning the knight on c6\n- b4b5: Pawn push, but doesn't help\n- h2h4/g2g4: Pawn pushes, but don't address immediate concerns\n\nThe most forcing move is a5b6, capturing the knight on c6. This:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the a-file for White's rook (though none exists yet)\n- Creates a passed pawn on b6\n- Doesn't weaken White's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses.
