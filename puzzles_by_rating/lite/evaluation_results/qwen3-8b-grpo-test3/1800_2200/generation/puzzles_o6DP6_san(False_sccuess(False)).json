When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+Q+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g7. White's king is on a1.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on g5 is very active. Black's knight on e5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on d4 is attacking the c4 pawn. White's bishop on g5 is eyeing the h6 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e5g6: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- e5c6: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- e7e6: Queen move protecting the knight\n- c4d4: Capturing the knight\n- a6a5: Pawn move creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on d4 attacking the c4 pawn. If we don't address this, White can play Nxc6 or Nf5.\n\nThe best move is to capture the knight with c4d4. This:\n- Removes the attacking piece\n- Opens the c-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over d4\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems (like e5g6 allowing Bxh6).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc4d4\n```"
