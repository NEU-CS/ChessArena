When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+B+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g7, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on h5 is attacking the knight on g8. White's bishop on c4 is eyeing the a6 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8h6: Moves the knight to safety while attacking the queen\n- g8f6: Moves the knight to f6, defending the queen\n- e5g4: Knight move attacking the queen\n- e5f3: Knight move attacking the rook\n- d7g4: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- e7g5: Bishop move attacking the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the knight on g8. If we don't address this, White can capture the knight with Qxg8.\n\nThe best move is to move the knight to f6, which:\n- Defends the knight on g8\n- Attacks the queen\n- Opens the g8-h6 diagonal for the knight\n- Maintains control over e4\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng8f6\n```"
