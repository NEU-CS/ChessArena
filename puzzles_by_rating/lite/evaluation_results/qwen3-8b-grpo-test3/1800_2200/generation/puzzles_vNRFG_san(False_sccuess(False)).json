When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a king and two pawns (a4, b5). White has a king, two pawns (a3, g4), and a knight. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is well-placed in the center (d6). White's king is slightly exposed on d3.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - Black has pawns on a4, b5, c5, h7\n   - White has pawns on a3, g4, h4\n   - The c5 pawn is isolated and could be a target\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - d6e5: Moves king towards the center\n   - d6d5: Moves king towards the queenside\n   - c5c4: Advances the c-pawn\n   - b5b4: Advances the b-pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the c5 pawn, which is isolated and could be captured by White's knight. Advancing the b-pawn with b5b4 serves multiple purposes:\n1. It creates a passed pawn on b4\n2. It opens lines for Black's king to attack the a3 pawn\n3. It prepares potential b4-b3 push to create a passed pawn\n4. It doesn't expose any pieces\n\nOther moves:\n- d6e5 allows White's knight more freedom\n- c5c4 would leave the b5 pawn undefended\n- d6d5 doesn't address the immediate concerns\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb5b4\n```"
