When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight; Black has Rook, Bishop). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on c1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White has a rook on d7 attacking the c7 pawn. Black's queen on g2 is eyeing the h1 rook.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g2h1: Capturing the rook with the queen\n- g2f1: Moving queen to safety\n- h2h6: Moving the h-pawn\n- f7f5: Pushing the f-pawn\n- c7c5: Pushing the c-pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on d7 attacking the c7 pawn. If White captures the pawn with Rxc7, White will be up a pawn and have a strong passed pawn.\n\nThe best move is to capture the rook with g2h1, winning the rook and maintaining material equality. This also opens the h-file for Black's rook.\n\n```\ng2h1\n```"
