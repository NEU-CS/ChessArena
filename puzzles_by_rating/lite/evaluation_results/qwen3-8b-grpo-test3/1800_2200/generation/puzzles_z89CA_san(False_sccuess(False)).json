When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g3. Black's king is on f6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on d4, f3, h2. Black has pawns on a7, b7, g6, h6. The d-pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on b4 is well-placed. Black's rook on d6 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b4b8: Rook lift, but doesn't seem to accomplish much immediately\n- b4b7: Attacks the b-pawn, but black can defend\n- b4c4: Moves rook to center\n- g3h4: Moves king towards the pawns\n- d4d5: Pawn push, gains space\n- f3f4: Pawn push, opens lines for white's pieces\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be d4d5 or f3f4. d4d5 would:\n- Gain space in the center\n- Open lines for white's rook\n- Potentially create a passed pawn\n- Put pressure on black's rook on d6\n\nf3f4 would:\n- Open lines for white's pieces\n- Create space for the king to move\n- But might weaken the e3 square\n\nAfter considering both options, d4d5 seems more flexible and creates more immediate opportunities.\n\n```\nd4d5\n```"
