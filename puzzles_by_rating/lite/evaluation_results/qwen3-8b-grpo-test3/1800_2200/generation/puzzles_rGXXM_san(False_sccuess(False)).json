When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h4. Black's king is on g6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a2, f4, h2. Black has pawns on b6, g5, h4. The f-pawn is isolated and vulnerable.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on b7 is very active. Black's rook on e8 is passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e8e7: Attacks the rook, but White can just move it\n- f6f7: Advances the pawn, but doesn't help much\n- f6e6: Moves the pawn to defend the rook\n- f6f5: Advances the pawn, but doesn't help\n- g6g5: Advances the king pawn, but doesn't help\n- b6b5: Advances the pawn, but doesn't help\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on b7, which is attacking the b6 pawn. If the pawn falls, White's rook will be very active. Therefore, the best move is to defend the pawn with:\n\n```\nf6e6\n```"
