When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's R+B+N+P). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g3. Black's king is on g7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on f4 is attacking White's knight on g3. White's bishop on d4 is eyeing Black's knight on e7.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f4g4: Capturing the knight with the rook\n- e7f6: Moving the knight to defend the rook\n- d7e5: Moving the knight to centralize\n- a5c5: Moving the bishop to defend the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on g3 which is under attack by the rook. If we don't capture it, White can play Kxf4 or move the knight to safety.\n\nf4g4 seems most forcing:\n- If White plays Kxf4, we have Nf6 attacking the king\n- If White moves the knight, we can capture the pawn on g2\n- It also opens the g-file for our king to escape if needed\n\nOther moves don't address the immediate threat to the knight. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf4g4\n```"
