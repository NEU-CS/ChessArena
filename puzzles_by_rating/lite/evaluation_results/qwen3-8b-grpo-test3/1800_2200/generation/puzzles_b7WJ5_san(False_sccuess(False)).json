When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on h6. White's king is on e1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on d6 is attacking Black's pawn on g7. White's bishop on e4 is eyeing the h7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h6h7: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h6g6: Moves king towards the center but still leaves it exposed\n- h6h5: Moves king towards the pawn but doesn't help\n- b3e6: Queen takes pawn - this wins material\n- Other queen moves don't seem to address the immediate threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is the queen on d6 attacking the g7 pawn. If White captures g7 with Qxg7, White will be up a queen for a pawn. Therefore, we need to defend the g7 pawn.\n\nThe best move is to capture the e6 pawn with the queen, which also opens up the b3-h7 diagonal for our bishop. This move:\n- Wins material (pawn)\n- Opens lines for our pieces\n- Doesn't expose our king further\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb3e6\n```"
