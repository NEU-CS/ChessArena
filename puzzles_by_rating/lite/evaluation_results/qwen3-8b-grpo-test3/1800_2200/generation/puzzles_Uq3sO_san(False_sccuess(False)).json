When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn (d6), Pawn (c6), Pawn (d5), Pawn (a4). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g3. Black's king is on c7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on e6 and b4. Black has pawns on d5 and a4 that could be dangerous.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's Rook on f8 is very active. Black's Rook is on a3, Bishop on c8.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e6e7: Pushing the passed pawn is tempting, but Black can capture with Kxe7\n- b4b5: Advancing the pawn could be useful, but doesn't seem urgent\n- f8f7: Moving the Rook to defend the e6 pawn\n- f8e8: Moving the Rook to defend the king\n- g3h4: Moving the king towards safety\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. The move g3h4 (King moves to h4) would:\n- Get the king out of the center\n- Avoid potential checks from Black's Rook\n- Maintain flexibility for future moves\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3h4\n```"
