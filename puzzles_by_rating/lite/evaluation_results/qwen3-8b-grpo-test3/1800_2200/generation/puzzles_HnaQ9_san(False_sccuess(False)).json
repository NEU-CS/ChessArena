When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a passed pawn on f7 that's very advanced.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on h2.\n\n3. Threats: White's f7 pawn is about to promote. Black needs to address this immediately.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8f7: Captures the pawn with the king. This stops the promotion and opens the g-file for Black's rook.\n- g8g7: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address the f7 pawn.\n- g8h7: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't help.\n- g8f8: Moves king towards the rook but doesn't address the pawn.\n\nThe only move that stops the pawn promotion is g8f7. After this:\n- The f7 pawn is captured\n- Black's king is now on f7 where it can support the pawns\n- White's bishop on g4 is now exposed to the king\n\nOther moves would allow f7f8=Q which would be disastrous for Black.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng8f7\n```"
