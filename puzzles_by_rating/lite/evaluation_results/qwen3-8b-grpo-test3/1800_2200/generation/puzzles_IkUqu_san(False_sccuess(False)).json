When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on c3 and bishop on g3 are well-placed. Black's bishops on d6 and e6 are very active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's bishop on e6 is eyeing the pawn on d4. White's queen on d4 is well-placed but needs to be protected.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d4e5: Queen takes pawn, attacking the bishop\n- c3d5: Knight move, attacking the bishop\n- e1e3: Rook move, protecting the queen\n- g3e5: Bishop move, attacking the bishop\n\nThe most pressing concern is the safety of the queen on d4. If we don't protect it, Black's bishop on e6 could capture it.\n\nThe best move is e1e3, which:\n- Protects the queen on d4\n- Opens the e-file for White's rook\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems (like d4e5 which would expose the queen further).\n\n```\ne1e3\n```"
