When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on f8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on d5 is attacking White's rook on d6. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g1h2: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address the immediate threat\n- g1h1: Similar to g1h2\n- g1f1: Moves king towards the center but still leaves the rook under attack\n- f6d4: Captures the queen with the knight\n- d6d4: Moves the rook to capture the queen\n- d1d4: Moves the rook to capture the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attacked rook on d6. All three rook moves (d6d4, d1d4) would capture the queen. However:\n\n- d6d4 would leave White's queen on f6 exposed to Black's knight on f7\n- d1d4 seems safest as it moves the rook away from potential knight attacks\n\nTherefore, the best move is d1d4, capturing the queen while maintaining piece safety.\n\n```\nd1d4\n```"
