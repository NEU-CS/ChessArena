When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, knight, rook, pawns. Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on f7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on b4 is attacking the pawn on e3. White's queen on h6 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h6g7: Queen takes pawn, but allows Black's queen to capture our rook\n- h6f6: Queen move, but doesn't address the e3 pawn threat\n- c3e4: Knight move attacking the knight\n- d5e6: Pawn capture, opening lines for White's pieces\n- f2f4: Pawn push creating space for the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on b4 attacking e3. If we don't address this, Black can play Nxd3 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is c3e4, moving the knight to defend e3 while also attacking Black's knight on b4. This maintains control over key squares and doesn't create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nc3e4\n```"
