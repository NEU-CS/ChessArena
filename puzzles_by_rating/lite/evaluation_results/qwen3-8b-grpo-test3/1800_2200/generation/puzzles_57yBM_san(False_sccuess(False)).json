When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight; Black has Rook, Bishop). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h5, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, h2, g2. Black has pawns on a7, b7, f4, g5. The f4 pawn is isolated and vulnerable.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on e6 is very active. Black's rook on d7 is well-placed.\n\n5. Threats: White's rook on e6 is attacking the black rook on d7. Black needs to address this immediately.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- Rook moves: Most rook moves (d7d8, d7g7, d7f7, d7e7, d7c7) would lose the rook to Re6xd6 or Re6xd7\n- d7d6 seems interesting as it attacks the e6 rook while also protecting the f4 pawn\n- Other moves: h5h4 (king move), c2c3 (pawn move), c2g2 (rook move), etc.\n\nThe best move appears to be d7d6 because:\n1. It attacks the e6 rook\n2. It protects the f4 pawn\n3. If White takes with Rxd6, Black can play Rxd6 and White's rook is exposed\n4. Other moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd7d6\n```"
