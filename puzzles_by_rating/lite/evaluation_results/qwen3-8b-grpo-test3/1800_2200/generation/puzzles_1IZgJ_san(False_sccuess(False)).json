When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on e8.\n\n3. Threats: White has a knight on c4 attacking the pawn on e5. Black's queen on b2 is attacking the pawn on a2.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b2e5: Capturing the knight with the queen\n- d7e5: Capturing the knight with the knight\n- b2a2: Capturing the pawn\n- g5g4: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n- e8e7: Moving the king to safety\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on c4. Both b2e5 and d7e5 capture the knight, but d7e5 (knight capture) is better because:\n1. It maintains the queen's attack on a2\n2. The knight on e5 is well-placed\n3. It keeps the queen active\n\nOther moves:\n- b2a2 is too slow\n- g5g4 doesn't address the immediate threat\n- e8e7 is unnecessary\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the knight with the knight:\n\n```\nd7e5\n```"
