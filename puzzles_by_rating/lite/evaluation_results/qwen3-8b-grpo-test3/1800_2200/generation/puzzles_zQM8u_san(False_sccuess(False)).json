When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Rook, Bishop, pawns; Black has Rook, Rook, Bishop, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g7. White's king is on h1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 king. White's rook on f1 is pressuring the f-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d8g5: Queen move attacking the queen\n- f8f2: Rook move attacking the rook\n- g7h6: King move getting out of potential checks\n- e4e3: Pawn push creating threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on g3. If it isn't addressed, White could play Qxg7 winning the king.\n\nd8g5 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the queen\n- Opens the diagonal for Black's bishop on h6\n- Maintains control over the g-file\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd8g5\n```"
