When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a pawn on f7 (promoted pawn) and a queen. Black has a queen, rook, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a2, b2, f2, g2, h2. Black has pawns on a7, b7, d5, g7. The f7 pawn is advanced and could be dangerous.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's queen on b3 is well-placed. The rook on g5 is active. Black's queen on c8 and rook on a8 are passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e5e6: Advances the pawn, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- g5g7: Rook capture, but black can play Kxg7\n- b3d5: Queen takes pawn, winning material\n- b3b7: Queen attack on the pawn\n- g2g4: Pawn advance to gain space\n\nThe most forcing move is b3d5, capturing the pawn with check. This:\n- Wins material (the d5 pawn)\n- Opens the d-file for white's rook\n- Maintains pressure on black's position\n- Doesn't allow black any counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb3d5\n```"
