When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on d6 is attacking the black pawn on c6. White's bishop on g3 is eyeing the h4 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7e6: Knight move attacking the queen\n- g7h5: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- f5f4: Pawn push creating space\n- b6d4: Queen move attacking the bishop\n- g6g5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the queen on d6. If we don't address it, White can play Qxc6 winning the pawn.\n\ng7e6 (Nxe6) seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the queen\n- Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng7e6\n```"
