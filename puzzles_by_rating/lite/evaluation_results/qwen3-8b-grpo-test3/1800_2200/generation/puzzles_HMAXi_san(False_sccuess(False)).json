When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's R+B+N+P). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is on f7, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on g5 is very active. Black's knight on c6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on g5 is eyeing the h7 pawn. White's bishop on g6 is very active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g6f5: Capturing the knight with the bishop seems most pressing. This removes White's active knight and opens the g-file for Black's rook.\n- Other moves like d6d5 or c6e7 don't address the immediate threat to h7.\n- f7e8 would be too passive.\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on g5. If we don't capture it, White could play Nxe6 or Nf3 with strong threats. Therefore, the best move is to capture the knight with the bishop:\n\n```\ng6f5\n```"
