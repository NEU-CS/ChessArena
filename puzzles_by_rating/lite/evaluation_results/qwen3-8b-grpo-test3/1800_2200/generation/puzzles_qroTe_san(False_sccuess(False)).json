When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on e2. Black's king is on d6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on g6, h4, and c4. Black has pawns on a4, e4, and h7. The e4 pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's knight on f7 is well-placed. White's bishop on a7 is inactive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f7h6: Knight move attacking the h-pawn\n- f7g5: Knight move centralizing\n- f7e5: Knight move attacking the e4 pawn\n- d6e5: King move attacking the e4 pawn\n- e4e3: Pawn push attacking the king\n- a4a3: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the e4 pawn, which is isolated and could be captured by White's king. The move d6e5 (king move) addresses this while also opening lines for Black's pieces.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd6e5\n```"
