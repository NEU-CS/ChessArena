When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b1. Black's king is on c7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on c3 is attacking Black's pawn on d5. White's queen on b3 is eyeing the b7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d4e5: Queen move attacking the knight\n- f6e5: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- c7d8: King move protecting the rook\n- d4c5: Queen move attacking the knight\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating space for the bishop\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on c3 attacking the d5 pawn. If the knight isn't addressed, White can play Nxd5 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is to attack the knight with the queen:\n\n```\nd4c5\n```"
