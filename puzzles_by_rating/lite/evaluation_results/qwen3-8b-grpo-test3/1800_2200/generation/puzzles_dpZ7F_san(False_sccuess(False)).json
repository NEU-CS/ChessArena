When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+Q+B+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also uncastled.\n\n3. Threats: White has a bishop on b5 attacking the knight on d6. White's knight on d3 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d8d7: Queen move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f6d7: Knight takes bishop, but allows White's knight to capture the knight\n- e5d7: Knight takes bishop, but similar issues\n- e5c6: Knight move, but doesn't help\n- g4d7: Bishop takes bishop - this seems most promising as it:\n  - Removes the bishop from b5\n  - Opens the g4-bishop's diagonal\n  - Maintains control over e5 square\n\nThe best move is g4d7 (Bxd7) as it:\n- Captures the bishop\n- Opens lines for Black's pieces\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng4d7\n```"
