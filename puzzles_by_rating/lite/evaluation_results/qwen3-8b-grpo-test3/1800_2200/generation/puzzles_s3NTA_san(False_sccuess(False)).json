When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is well-placed at f5. White's king is at f3, protecting the pawns.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - Black has passed pawns at a5 and c3\n   - White has a passed pawn at d4\n   - The c3 pawn is isolated and vulnerable\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - f5g6: Moves king towards the kingside pawns\n   - f5f6: Moves king forward\n   - f5e6: Moves king towards the center\n   - f5g5: Moves king towards the h-pawn\n   - f5g4: Moves king towards the d-pawn\n   - h5h4: Advances the h-pawn\n   - a5a4: Advances the a-pawn\n   - c3c2: Advances the c-pawn towards promotion\n\nThe most pressing concern is the c3 pawn, which is isolated and could be captured by White's king. The move c3c2 advances this pawn towards promotion while also creating a passed pawn. This would force White to deal with this new threat while also opening lines for Black's king to attack the d4 pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc3c2\n```"
