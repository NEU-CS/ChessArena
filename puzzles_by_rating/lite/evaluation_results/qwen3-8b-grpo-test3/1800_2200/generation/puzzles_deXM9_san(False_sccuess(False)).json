When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (e8). Both need to castle.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on g5 is very active. Black's knight on e4 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: Black's knight on e4 is attacking White's pawn on d4. White needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f3e4: Capturing the knight with the knight seems most pressing\n- c4e6: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- d4d5: Pawn push gaining space\n- e1g1: Castling kingside\n\nThe most urgent concern is the knight on e4 attacking d4. If we don't address it, Black could play Nxd2 or Nxf3.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the knight with f3e4. This:\n- Removes the immediate threat to d4\n- Opens the f-file for White's rook\n- Maintains control over e4\n- Doesn't weaken any pawns\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nf3e4\n```"
