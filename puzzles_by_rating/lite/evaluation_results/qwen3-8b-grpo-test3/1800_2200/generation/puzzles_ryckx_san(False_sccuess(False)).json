When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on d2. Black's king is on h6.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, b4, d3, g3. Black has pawns on a5, b5, f4, g5. The b-pawns are blocked.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on c6 is very active. White's bishop on g2 is blocked by its own pawn on g3.\n\n5. Threats: Black's rook on g6 is eyeing the g-file. White needs to address this.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- c6e5: Knight move attacking the rook\n- g2e4: Bishop move opening lines\n- d2c3: King move towards the center\n- g3f4: Pawn capture opening the g-file for the bishop\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on g6. If we don't address it, Black could play Rg2+ or Rg1.\n\nc6e5 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the rook\n- Opens the e5 square for the knight\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves:\n- g2e4 allows Rg2+ \n- d2c3 doesn't address the rook\n- g3f4 opens lines for Black's rook\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
