When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+B). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h2. Black's king is on f8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on g4 is attacking the h4 pawn. White's rook on h5 is attacking the g5 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g4h4: Capturing the h4 pawn with the rook\n- g4g8: Moving the rook to the back rank\n- d3e4: Moving the bishop to attack the rook\n- c7c2: Moving the rook to attack the pawn\n- b6b5: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the h4 pawn. If Black captures it with g4h4, White can play Rh5xg5, winning the pawn. Alternatively, if White doesn't take the pawn, Black can play Rh4-h2+ next move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the h4 pawn immediately:\n\n```\ng4h4\n```"
