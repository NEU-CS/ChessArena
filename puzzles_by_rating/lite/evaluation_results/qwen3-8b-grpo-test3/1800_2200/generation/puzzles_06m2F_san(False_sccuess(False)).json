When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Bishop, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on c1.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on g4 is attacking the f4 pawn. White's queen on h3 is eyeing the h-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f6g5: Knight move attacking the rook\n- f6e5: Knight move centralizing\n- f4f3: Pawn push creating threats\n- e4e3: Pawn push opening lines\n- b7d5: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on g4. If we don't address this, White could play Rxf4 or Rg8+.\n\nf6g5 seems most promising:\n- Attacks the rook\n- If Rxf4, then Nxe4 wins the pawn\n- If Rg8+, then f8g8 blocks\n- Opens possibilities for our knight to attack the queen\n\nOther moves:\n- f4f3 creates threats but doesn't address the rook\n- e4e3 opens lines for our pieces but doesn't help defense\n- b7d5 is too slow\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
