When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on e7.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on c3 is attacking White's bishop on e3. White's rook on g7 is attacking Black's rook on f8.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f1f7: Rook takes pawn, but doesn't address the queen attack\n- e3h6: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- d3e4: Knight move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f1f2: Rook move to defend the king\n- e3f2: Bishop move to defend the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the bishop by the queen. If we don't address this, we'll lose the bishop.\n\nThe best move is to move the bishop to f2, where it defends both the king and the e3 square from the queen's attack.\n\n```\ne3f2\n```"
