When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on e5. Black's king is on d7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on d6 and a4. Black has pawns on a6, b7, h4.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on f7 is very active. Black's knight on f4 is also active.\n\n5. Threats: White's knight on f7 is attacking the pawn on e5. Black's knight on f4 is attacking the pawn on e6.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- d7e8: King move, but doesn't help\n- d7c8: King move, doesn't help\n- d7c6: King move, could be useful to support the knight\n- f4e6: Knight move, captures the pawn and opens the e-file for Black's king\n- f4h5: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f4d5: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f4h3: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f4d3: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f4g2: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f4e2: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- b7b6: Pawn move, doesn't seem to help\n- g6g5: Pawn move, doesn't seem to help\n- a6a5: Pawn move, doesn't seem to help\n- h4h3: Pawn move, could be useful to open lines for the knight\n- b7b5: Pawn move, doesn't seem to help\n\nThe most promising move is f4e6, capturing the pawn and opening the e-file for Black's king to support the knight on f7.\n\n```\nf4e6\n```"
