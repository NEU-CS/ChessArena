When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop, knight, and two pawns. White has a knight, pawn, and king. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g5. Black's king is on f2, also exposed.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on e6 and h4. Black has pawns on c5 and b4. The e6 pawn is advanced and dangerous.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's bishop on e7 is well-placed. White's knight on f4 is active.\n\n5. Threats: White's pawn on e6 is threatening to promote. Black needs to address this immediately.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- e7f6: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- e7d6: Bishop move protecting the e6 pawn\n- e7g5: Bishop move attacking the king\n- f2g3: King move towards the knight\n- f2e3: King move towards the center\n- b2e5: Knight move attacking the e6 pawn\n- b2d4: Knight move towards the center\n- c5c4: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the e6 pawn. If it promotes, White will have a decisive material advantage. Therefore, we need to either:\n\n1. Capture the e6 pawn with b2e5\n2. Block the pawn with e7d6\n3. Move the king towards the pawn\n\nAmong these, b2e5 (Knight takes e6 pawn) is the most direct solution. It eliminates the immediate threat while developing the knight to an active square.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb2e5\n```"
