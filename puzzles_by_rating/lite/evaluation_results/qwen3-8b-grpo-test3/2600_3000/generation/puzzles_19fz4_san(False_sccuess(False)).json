When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on e3. Black's king is on d6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on b4, d4. Black has pawns on d5, h5. The d-pawns are blocked.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on b7 is well-placed. White's bishop on a6 is active. Black's bishop on g6 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e3f3: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e3d3: Moves king towards the queenside\n- e3e2: Moves king towards the center\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. All moves leave the king exposed to potential checks or attacks. However, e3d3 seems the most prudent as it:\n- Moves the king towards the queenside where there's more space\n- Doesn't expose the king to immediate threats\n- Maintains some flexibility for future moves\n\nThe other moves either leave the king in the same position or move it towards the center where it could be more vulnerable.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3d3\n```"
