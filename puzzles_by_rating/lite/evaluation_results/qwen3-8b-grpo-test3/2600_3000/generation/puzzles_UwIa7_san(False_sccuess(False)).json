When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on h5 is eyeing the g6 pawn. White's queen on e3 is well-placed. Black's queen on f6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f6g5: Queen move attacking the bishop\n- f6e6: Queen move centralizing\n- f6h4: Queen move attacking the h-pawn\n- d7e6: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- c4e4: Rook move attacking the pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's bishop on h5 which is unprotected. If we don't address this, White could play Bxg6 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is to play f6g5, attacking the bishop while also preparing to defend the g6 pawn. This move:\n- Attacks the bishop\n- Opens the g-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e6\n- Doesn't expose any pieces\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
