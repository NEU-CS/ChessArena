When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's R+B+N+P). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is also in the center (g1).\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has advanced pawns on e5/f5 that are creating space. Black has pawns on d7/e5/g5.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on c4 is very active. Black's bishop on c8 is inactive.\n\n5. Threats: White's knight on d2 is eyeing the e4 square. Black's knight on g8 is undeveloped.\n\nLooking at the candidate moves:\n\n- g8f6: Develops the knight to a natural square, attacking the e4 pawn\n- f8e7: Develops the bishop to a natural square\n- c6e4: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- g5e6: Pawn capture opening the diagonal for the bishop\n- c8e6: Bishop development\n\nThe most pressing concern is developing pieces while addressing the e4 pawn. The knight move c6e4 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the bishop on c4\n- Opens the e4 pawn for potential knight development\n- Maintains control over d2\n\nOther moves like g8f6 or f8e7 are also reasonable, but c6e4 seems most active.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc6e4\n```"
