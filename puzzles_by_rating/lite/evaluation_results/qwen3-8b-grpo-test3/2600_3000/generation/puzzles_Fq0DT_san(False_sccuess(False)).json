When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Rook, Knight, Queen; Black has Rook, Rook, Bishop, Knight). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on h3 is eyeing the h7 pawn. White's knight on c3 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b7e4: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- c5e3: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- f7f5: Pawn push creating space\n- g6g5: Pawn push creating space\n- b5b4: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on h3. If we don't address this, White could play Qxh7 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is c5e3, attacking the queen while also developing the bishop to a more active square. This:\n- Attacks the queen\n- Opens the diagonal for the bishop\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n- Maintains control over e3\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nc5e3\n```"
