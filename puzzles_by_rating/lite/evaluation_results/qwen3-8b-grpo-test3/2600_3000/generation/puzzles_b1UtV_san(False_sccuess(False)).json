When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+Q+R vs Black's R+R). White has a knight on a7 that's very active.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on c7. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on a7 is attacking Black's rook on d8. White's queen on a5 is eyeing the a-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c7b8: Moves king towards the knight but doesn't address the immediate threat to the rook\n- c7d7: Moves king towards the center but still leaves the rook under attack\n- b7b6: Moves the rook to defend the d-file and potentially support the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight attacking the rook. None of the moves fully address this, but b7b6 seems the most flexible:\n\n- It defends the d-file where White's queen is positioned\n- It opens the possibility of moving the rook to b7 to support the king\n- It doesn't expose the king further\n\nThe other moves leave the rook under attack without adequate defense. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb7b6\n```"
