When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight vs Black's Rook). Materially, White is ahead.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e3. Black's king is on e7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on f4 and g3. Black has pawns on b7, c6, d6, h6.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on b4 is very active. Black's rook on a5 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- a5e5: Rook move attacking the king\n- e6f5: Pawn capture opening lines\n- g7g5: Pawn push creating space\n- c6c5: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on b4. If it stays there, White can play Rb7 winning the pawn. Therefore, we need to address this immediately.\n\na5e5 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the white king\n- Opens the e-file for black's rook\n- Forces white to respond\n- Maintains pressure on the b-file\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na5e5\n```"
