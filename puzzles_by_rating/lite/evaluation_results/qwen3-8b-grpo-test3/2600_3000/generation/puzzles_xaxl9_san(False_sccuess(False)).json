When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is exposed on a8. White's king is on e7, well-placed.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on d6 and e6 that could be dangerous. Black has pawns on f7, g5, h6 that need protection.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- a8b7: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c6c8: Rook move (but there's no rook on c6 - this must be a typo in the legal moves)\n- c6c7: Same issue\n- c6d6: Capturing the pawn on d6 would be significant\n- c6b6: Moving towards the queenside\n- c6c5/c4/c3/c2/c1: Various rook moves (again, unclear piece on c6)\n- f7f6: Pawn move protecting e6 pawn\n- h6h5: Pawn move creating space\n- g5g4: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most concrete move is c6d6 - capturing the pawn on d6. This:\n- Removes a passed pawn\n- Opens the c-file for Black's rook (if there was one)\n- Maintains control over e6 pawn\n\nOther moves don't address the immediate threat of the d6 pawn. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc6d6\n```"
