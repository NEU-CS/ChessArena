When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h6.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g7. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on h1 is eyeing the h-file. Black's rook on d2 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b6d5: Knight move attacking the f-pawn\n- b6c4: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- d2h2: Rook move attacking the h-pawn\n- d2g2: Rook move attacking the king\n- b5b4: Pawn push creating space for the knight\n- c3c2: Pawn push attacking the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's h-pawn on h6 which is very close to promotion. If it promotes, White will have a decisive material advantage.\n\nThe best move is d2h2, attacking the h-pawn with the rook. This:\n- Prevents the h-pawn from promoting\n- Opens the h-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nd2h2\n```"
