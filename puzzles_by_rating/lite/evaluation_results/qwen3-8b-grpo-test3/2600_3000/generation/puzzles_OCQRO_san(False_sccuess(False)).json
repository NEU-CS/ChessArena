When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight on g5, knight on d2, bishop on c1, rook on e1, pawns. Black has a queen on f8, rook on f8, bishop on c8, knight on f6, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is on g1, Black's king on g8. Both are relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on g5 is very active. Black's knight on f6 is also well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on g5 is attacking the h7 pawn. Black's knight on f6 is protecting it.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g5h7: Knight takes h7 pawn - but Black's knight protects it\n- g5f7: Knight move - but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- e2e6: Rook move - but doesn't threaten anything\n- d2e4: Knight move - centralizing the knight\n- c3c4: Pawn move - gaining space\n\nThe most promising move seems to be d2e4, moving the knight to e4 where it:\n- Attacks the d6 pawn\n- Supports the center\n- Prepares potential knight jumps to f6 or d6\n- Doesn't block any other pieces\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd2e4\n```"
