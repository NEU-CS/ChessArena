When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f1. Black's king is on d4, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a4, d5, g4, h2. Black has pawns on a5, b4, d3, e3, h6. The d5 pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on c2 is well-placed. Black's bishop on g2 is very active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c2h7: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- c2g6: Bishop move, attacks the h6 pawn\n- c2f5: Bishop move, centralizes\n- c2e4: Bishop move, attacks the d3 pawn\n- c2d3: Bishop takes pawn, wins material\n- c2d1: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- c2b1: Bishop move, doesn't help\n- f1g2: King move, but exposes to bishop\n- f1e2: King move, safer\n- g4g5: Pawn push, gains space\n- h2h3/h2h4: Pawn pushes, don't seem helpful\n\nThe most concrete gain is c2d3, capturing the pawn and winning material. After this move:\n- White wins a pawn\n- The bishop remains well-placed\n- Black's position becomes slightly weaker\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc2d3\n```"
