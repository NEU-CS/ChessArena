When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed at d2. Black's king is at g8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns at e5 and g2. Black has pawns at a5, c4, e6, h7. The e-pawns are blocked.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d2e3: Moves king towards the center but exposes it to checks\n- d2c3: Moves king towards the pawns but still exposed\n- d2e2: Moves king towards the center\n- d2c2: Moves king towards the queenside\n- d2e1: Moves king towards the corner\n- d2d1: Moves king towards the corner\n- d2c1: Moves king towards the corner\n- g3g4: Advances pawn but weakens f3\n- h2h3: Simple pawn move\n- f2f3: Advances pawn and protects e5 pawn\n- h2h4: Advances pawn\n- f2f4: Advances pawn and opens line for king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. The best move is to advance the f-pawn to protect the e5 pawn and create space for the king to move towards safety.\n\n```\nf2f3\n```"
