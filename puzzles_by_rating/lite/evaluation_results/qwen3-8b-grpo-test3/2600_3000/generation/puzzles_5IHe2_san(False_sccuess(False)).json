When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on d2 is attacking the pawn on f2. White's queen on c6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c6e8: Queen takes rook - but black's rook is already gone\n- c6d5: Queen move attacking the bishop\n- c4e6: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- e1e8: Rook move - but no immediate threat\n- h3g4: Pawn capture - but no pawn on g4\n- a4a5: Pawn push - but not urgent\n\nThe most pressing concern is the black queen on d2 attacking the f2 pawn. If we don't address this, black could play Qxf2 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is to defend the f2 pawn while also maintaining our queen's active position. The move c4e6 (Bishop to e6) does both - it defends f2 and attacks the pawn on e6.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc4e6\n```"
