When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g6. Black's king is on d6.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has a passed pawn on g7 that's very advanced. Black has a pawn on h3 that's close to promotion.\n\n4. Immediate threats: Black's h3 pawn is one square from promotion. White must address this immediately.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f6g5: Moves knight towards the h3 pawn\n- f6f5: Moves knight towards the center\n- g6e8: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- g6h7: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n\nThe most pressing concern is the h3 pawn. If it promotes, White will be in serious trouble. Therefore, we need to stop the pawn from promoting.\n\nThe knight move f6g5 is the only move that directly addresses the h3 pawn. From g5, the knight can:\n- Attack the h3 pawn\n- Potentially move to f3 or e4 to block the pawn\n- Maintain flexibility in the position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or leave White's king exposed.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
