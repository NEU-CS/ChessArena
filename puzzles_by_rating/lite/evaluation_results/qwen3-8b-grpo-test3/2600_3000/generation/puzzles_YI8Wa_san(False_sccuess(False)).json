When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a king and two pawns (f2, g3). Black has a king, a pawn (h7), and three pawns (d5, e4, a7). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on g6, close to White's pawns.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on f2 and g3. Black has a passed pawn on e4 that could be dangerous.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g2h2: Moves king towards the h-pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g2g1: Moves king towards the center but away from the pawns\n- g2f1: Similar to g2g1\n- f4f5: Advances the f-pawn but leaves it vulnerable\n- h3h4: Advances the h-pawn but doesn't help much\n- g3g4: Advances the g-pawn and creates space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is Black's e4 pawn which is close to promotion. White needs to either:\n1) Stop the e-pawn from advancing, or\n2) Create counterplay with his own pawns\n\ng3g4 seems the most promising move:\n- It creates space for White's king to move towards the e-pawn\n- It opens a path for the f-pawn to advance (f4-f5)\n- It doesn't weaken White's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
