When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on c2. Black's king is on b4, close to White's pawns.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on e4 and f4. Black has pawns on g5 and h4 that are advanced.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f4g5: Captures the g5 pawn, opening the f-file for White's king\n- f4f5: Advances the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- e4e5: Advances the pawn, but doesn't help much\n- h3h4: Advances the h-pawn, but doesn't help\n- g3g4: Captures the g4 pawn, opening the g-file for White's king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. Both f4g5 and g3g4 open lines for the king to move towards safety while also gaining space.\n\nBetween these, g3g4 seems slightly better because:\n1. It captures a pawn\n2. It opens the g-file for the king to move towards the center\n3. It doesn't leave the f-pawn isolated\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
