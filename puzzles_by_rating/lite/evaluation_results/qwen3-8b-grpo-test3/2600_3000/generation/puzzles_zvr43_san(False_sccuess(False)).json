When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on c1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on c3 is attacking Black's queen on c4. White's queen on f1 is eyeing the f7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c4e4: Moves queen to defend the e4 pawn and attacks the bishop\n- d3e4: Moves bishop to defend the e4 pawn\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating space for the king\n- c4d5: Queen move attacking the d5 pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the queen. If we don't defend it, White can win the queen with Bxd4 or Qf2.\n\nThe best move is to move the queen to e4, where it defends the e4 pawn and also attacks the bishop. This maintains material equality and doesn't create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nc4e4\n```"
