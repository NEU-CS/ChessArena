When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's Q+R+B). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: \n   - Black's queen on g3 is attacking the knight on f3\n   - Black's rook on d2 is attacking the pawn on e2\n   - White's rook on h2 is eyeing the h-file\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - g3e5: Queen takes pawn, attacking the knight\n   - d2d8: Rook move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n   - f5f4: Pawn push, gaining space\n   - g5g4: Pawn push, opening lines for the bishop\n   - f2g1: Rook move, but White's king would capture\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on f3 which is under attack by the queen. If we take the pawn with g3e5, we also attack the knight. White would likely play Nxd4 or Nxd4, but this would open lines for our pieces.\n\nAfter considering all options, the most active move is g3e5, attacking both the pawn and the knight while opening lines for our pieces.\n\n```\ng3e5\n```"
