When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White king is at e3, Black king at e5. Both kings are exposed but not immediately threatened.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White's pawns are advanced (g4, h4)\n   - Black's pawns are also advanced (g5, h6)\n   - The c-pawns are blocked (c3 vs c5)\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - e3f3: Moves king towards the pawns\n   - e3d3: Moves king towards the queenside\n   - e3f2: Moves king towards the kingside\n   - e3e2: Moves king towards the center\n   - e3d2: Moves king towards the queenside\n   - h4h5: Advances pawn, but allows g5h4\n   - g4g5: Advances pawn, but allows h6g5\n   - c3c4: Advances pawn, but allows d5c4\n   - a3a4: Advances pawn, but doesn't seem helpful\n   - b2b3/b2b4: Pawn moves that don't seem immediately useful\n\nThe most pressing concern is the pawn structure and king safety. The white king is somewhat exposed at e3. Moving it towards the center with e3e2 seems most flexible, maintaining options to go either direction while keeping the king safer.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3e2\n```"
