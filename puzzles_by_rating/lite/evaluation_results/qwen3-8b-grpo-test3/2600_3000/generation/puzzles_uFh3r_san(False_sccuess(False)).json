When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on c1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on g4 is well-placed. Black's knight on c6 and bishop on g6 are active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's queen on d8 is eyeing the d-file. White's rook on h1 could be vulnerable.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e2g4: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- c2e4: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- d1d4: Rook move centralizing\n- f4d6: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- c4c5: Pawn push gaining space\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most pressing concern is White's exposed king. The move c1d2 (king move) would:\n- Get the king out of the center\n- Protect the d2 pawn\n- Allow the rook on d1 to defend the king\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc1d2\n```"
