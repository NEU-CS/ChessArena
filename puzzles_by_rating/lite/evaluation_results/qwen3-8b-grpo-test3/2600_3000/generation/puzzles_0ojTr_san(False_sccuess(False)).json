When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a king and two pawns (a7, b7). White has a king and four pawns (a5, b5, g3, h3). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is centralized at e6. White's king is at d4, also centralized.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White has passed pawns at a5 and b5\n   - Black has pawns at a7, b7, and h6\n   - The g3 pawn is isolated\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - e6f7: Moves king towards the kingside\n   - e6e7: Moves king towards the queenside\n   - e6d7: Moves king towards the queenside\n   - e6f6: Moves king towards the kingside\n   - b7b6: Pawn move that opens the b-file for Black's king\n   - a7a6: Pawn move that opens the a-file\n   - h6h5: Pawn move that creates space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's passed pawns on the queenside. If they advance, they could become dangerous. Black needs to either:\n1) Stop the pawns with the king\n2) Create counterplay with the pawns\n\nb7b6 seems most promising as it:\n- Opens the b-file for Black's king to approach the pawns\n- Creates space for the king to move\n- Doesn't weaken Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb7b6\n```"
