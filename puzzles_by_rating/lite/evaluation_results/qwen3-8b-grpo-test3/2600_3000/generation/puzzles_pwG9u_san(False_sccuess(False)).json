When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on e4. Black's king is on g4, also exposed but closer to the action.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on f2 and g5. Black has pawns on b7 and h5. The g5 pawn is isolated and vulnerable.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's bishop on g1 is very active. White's bishop on e1 is passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g4g5: King move attacking the g5 pawn\n- g4h4: King move towards the h-pawn\n- g4h3: King move towards the f-pawn\n- g1h2: Bishop move attacking the h2 pawn\n- g1f2: Bishop move attacking the f2 pawn\n- b7b6: Pawn move creating space for the bishop\n- h5h4: Pawn push creating space for the king\n- b7b5: Pawn push controlling the center\n\nThe most pressing concern is the g5 pawn which is isolated and could be a target. The move g4g5 (king move) directly addresses this by attacking the pawn while also moving the king towards the center.\n\nOther moves:\n- g1f2 would attack the f2 pawn but leave the g5 pawn vulnerable\n- h5h4 would create space for the king but doesn't address the g5 pawn\n- b7b5 would control the center but doesn't help immediately\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play g4g5, attacking the g5 pawn and moving the king towards the center.\n\n```\ng4g5\n```"
