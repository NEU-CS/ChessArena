When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e6. Black's king is on h7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, f7. Black has pawns on h5, g6. The f7 pawn is promoted and dangerous.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on e5 is well-placed. Black's bishop on b4 is active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- h7h8: King move, but doesn't help\n- h7g7: King move towards the center\n- h7h6: King move, but doesn't help\n- b4f8: Bishop move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- b4e7: Bishop move, attacks the knight\n- b4d6: Bishop move, controls e5 square\n- b4c5: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- b4a5: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- b4c3: Bishop move, attacks the a3 pawn\n- b4a3: Bishop move, captures the a3 pawn\n- b4d2: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- b4e1: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- g6g5: Pawn push, creates space for the king\n- h5h4: Pawn push, creates space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the f7 pawn which is about to promote. While none of the moves directly address this, the best move is to push g6g5, creating space for the king to move towards the center and potentially support the h5 pawn's advance.\n\n```\ng6g5\n```"
