When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is exposed at e4. Black's king is at d6, well-placed to support pawns.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White has pawns at a3, b2, c3, g2, h2\n   - Black has pawns at a7, b5, c4, f7, g7\n   - The c4 pawn is isolated and could be a target\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - d6e6: Moves king closer to white's pawns\n   - d6c6: Moves king towards the queenside\n   - b5b4: Advances the pawn, creating space\n   - f7f5: Advances the pawn, creating space\n   - g7g5: Same as f7f5\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king at e4. Moving the king towards it with d6e6 seems most prudent. This:\n- Protects the c4 pawn\n- Moves the king closer to White's king\n- Maintains flexibility to support other pawns\n\nOther moves:\n- b5b4 would open lines for White's pawns\n- f7/f5/g5 advances but doesn't address the immediate concern\n- King moves to c6 or e6 are more useful\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd6e6\n```"
