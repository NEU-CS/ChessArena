When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Rook, Bishop, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h7, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's queen on c6 is very active. Black's queen on g6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's queen on c6 is attacking the d7 knight. Black needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d7e5: Moves the knight to defend the queen while attacking the pawn\n- f6e5: Rook move attacking the queen\n- f6g7: Rook move attacking the pawn\n- d6d5: Pawn push creating space\n- f6e6: Rook move defending the e-file\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the d7 knight. If we don't defend it, White can capture it with Qxd7.\n\nThe best move is d7e5, which:\n- Moves the knight to defend the queen\n- Attacks the e5 pawn\n- Opens the d7 square for the rook\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nd7e5\n```"
