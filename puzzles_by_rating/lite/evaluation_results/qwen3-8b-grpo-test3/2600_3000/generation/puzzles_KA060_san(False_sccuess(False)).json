When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a knight (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight; Black has Rook, Bishop, Knight). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b1. Black's king is on f8.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on h8 is attacking Black's knight on g8. White's bishop on e3 is eyeing the long diagonal.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f8e8: Moves king towards the center\n- f8f7: Moves king towards the pawns\n- f8e7: Moves king towards the center\n- a8e8: Rook move defending the knight\n- d7e6: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- f6g5: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- b4c6: Knight move attacking the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on h8 attacking the knight on g8. If we don't address this, White can win the knight.\n\nThe best move is to move the knight to safety while also developing a piece:\n\n```\nf6g5\n```\n\nThis move:\n- Moves the knight to safety from the rook's attack\n- Attacks the bishop on e3\n- Opens the f6-square for the king to move towards the center\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, f6g5 is the most principled move."
