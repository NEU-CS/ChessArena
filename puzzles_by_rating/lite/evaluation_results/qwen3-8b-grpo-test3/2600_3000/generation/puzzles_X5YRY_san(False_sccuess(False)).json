When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on e2. Black's king is still in the center on e8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on g4 is eyeing the g2 pawn. White's knight on h5 is under attack by the pawn on g5.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e2d3: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e2f2: Moves king towards the kingside but still leaves it exposed\n- e2d2: Similar to e2d3\n- e2f1: Moves king towards the corner but away from the action\n- e2e1: Moves king towards the corner\n- g5f3: Captures the knight with the pawn, opening the g-file for White's rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h5 which is under attack by the g5 pawn. If we don't address this, we'll lose the knight.\n\ng5f3:\n- Captures the knight\n- Opens the g-file for White's rook on g1\n- Removes the pawn from g5 which was attacking the knight\n- Creates a passed pawn on f3 which can be advanced later\n\nOther moves don't address the immediate threat to the knight. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5f3\n```"
