When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's rook on b6 is very active. Black's queen on c8 and rook on d7 are also active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's knight on e5 is eyeing the pawn on d3. White's pawn on e3 is under attack by the knight.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b6e6: Rook move attacking the knight\n- b6d6: Rook move attacking the rook\n- b1e4: Knight move attacking the knight\n- a5e1: Queen move attacking the rook\n- e3e4: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e5 attacking the e3 pawn. If we don't address this, Black could play Nxd3 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is b1e4, moving the knight to defend the e3 pawn while also attacking the knight on e5. This:\n- Defends the e3 pawn\n- Attacks the knight on e5\n- Opens the b1-h7 diagonal for White's bishop\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nb1e4\n```"
