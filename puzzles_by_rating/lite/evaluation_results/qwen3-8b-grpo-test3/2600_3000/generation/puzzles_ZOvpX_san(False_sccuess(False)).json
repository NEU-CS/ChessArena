When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is at d3, Black's king at f6. Both kings are active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White's pawns: a4, b3, c3, g5\n   - Black's pawns: a5, c5, h6\n   - The g5 pawn is advanced and could be a threat\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - d3e4: Moves king towards the center\n   - d3e3: Moves king towards the pawns\n   - d3c3: Moves king towards the queenside pawns\n   - d3e2: Moves king towards the kingside\n   - d3d2: Moves king towards the kingside\n   - d3c2: Moves king towards the queenside\n   - b3b4: Advances the b-pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the g5 pawn which is close to promotion. White needs to either:\n1) Stop the g-pawn from promoting, or\n2) Create counterplay of our own\n\nThe move b3b4 seems most promising as it:\n- Opens the b-file for our king to move towards the kingside\n- Creates potential for a passed pawn on b5\n- Doesn't allow Black any counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb3b4\n```"
