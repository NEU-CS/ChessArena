When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety:\n- White king is exposed on d3\n- Black king is on f5, relatively safe\n\n3. Threats:\n- Black queen on b1 is attacking the white rook on a7\n- White queen on h5 is eyeing the h7 pawn\n- Black rook on d1 is controlling the d-file\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f5e6: King moves towards the center\n- f5e4: King moves towards the white king\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f5e4 is the better move because:\n  - It brings the king closer to the white king, potentially creating mating threats\n  - It maintains pressure on the e4 pawn\n  - It doesn't expose the king to any new dangers\n- f5e6 would be too passive and doesn't improve Black's position\n\nThe move f5e4 also opens up possibilities for the black rook on d1 to become more active.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf5e4\n```"
