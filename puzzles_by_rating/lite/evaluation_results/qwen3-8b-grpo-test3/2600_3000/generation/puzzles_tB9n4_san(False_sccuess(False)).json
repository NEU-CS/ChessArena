When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight; Black has Rook, Bishop, Knight). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's rook on e6 is very active. Black's rook on d8 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's rook on e6 is attacking the pawn on e7. Black's knight on f6 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f6e7: Capturing the pawn with the knight\n- c7e5: Moving the queen to attack the bishop\n- f5f4: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n- h6g4: Moving the knight to a more active square\n\nThe most pressing concern is the pawn on e7 that's under attack by the rook. If White takes the pawn with Rxe7, Black loses the knight on f6. Therefore, we need to defend the pawn or capture it ourselves.\n\nThe best move is f6e7, capturing the pawn with the knight. This:\n- Defends the pawn\n- Opens the e7 pawn for potential counterplay\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't expose our pieces further\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nf6e7\n```"
