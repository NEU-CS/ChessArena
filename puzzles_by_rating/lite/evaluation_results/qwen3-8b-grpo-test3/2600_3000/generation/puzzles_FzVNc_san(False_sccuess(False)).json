When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on h5 is eyeing the h3 pawn. Black's bishop on f4 is attacking the e3 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4e5: Pushing the pawn to gain space and protect the e3 pawn\n- f1f4: Moving the rook to defend the e3 pawn\n- b6d4: Knight move attacking the queen\n- a2d5: Rook move attacking the knight\n- d3e2: Rook move protecting the king\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- e4e5 seems most flexible, gaining space and opening lines for White's pieces\n- It also prevents Black's bishop from moving to e3\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses\n\nThe best move is therefore:\n\n```\ne4e5\n```"
