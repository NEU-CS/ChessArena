When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a king and two pawns (a6, b6). White has a king, knight (g6), pawns (a3, b3, c3, h3), and a bishop (g4). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on d5. White's king is on f4, also exposed but less so.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on a3/b3/c3 that could be dangerous. Black's pawns on a6/b6 are blocked by white pawns.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c5d6: Moves king towards white's pawns but away from the g4 bishop\n- c5c6: Moves king towards the a-pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c5d4: Moves king towards white's king and knight\n- c5c4: Moves king towards the a-pawn and away from the bishop\n\nThe most pressing concern is the white knight on g6 which is attacking the h4 pawn. If the knight moves, it could capture the h4 pawn. Also, white's bishop on g4 is eyeing the h3 pawn.\n\nThe best move is c5d4 because:\n1. It moves the king closer to white's knight\n2. It maintains protection of the h4 pawn\n3. It doesn't move too far from the g4 bishop\n4. It keeps options open for both attacking white's pawns and defending black's pawns\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nc5d4\n```"
