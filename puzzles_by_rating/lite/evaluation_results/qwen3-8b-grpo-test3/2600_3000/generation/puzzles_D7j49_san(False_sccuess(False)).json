When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight; Black has Rook, Bishop). Materially, White is ahead.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g3. Black's king is on g7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a2, g2. Black has pawns on a6, c6, d6, h7. The e-pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on a5 is very active. Black's rook on f4 is also active.\n\n5. Threats: White's rook on a5 is attacking the a6 pawn. Black's rook on f4 is attacking the f2 pawn.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- g7h8/g7g8/g7f8: King moves don't seem helpful\n- g7f7: King move towards the center\n- g7h6/g7f6: King moves towards the pawns\n- f4f8/f4f7/f4f6/f4f5: Rook moves up the f-file\n- f4h4/f4g4: Rook moves towards the kingside\n- f4f3/f4f2/f4f1: Rook moves down the f-file\n- h7h6: Pawn move creating space for the king\n- g6g5: Pawn move creating space for the king\n- c6c5: Pawn move defending the a6 pawn\n- e4e3: Pawn push creating threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is the a6 pawn under attack by White's rook. If we don't defend it, White can capture it with Ra5xa6.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to defend the a6 pawn with c6c5.\n\n```\nc6c5\n```"
