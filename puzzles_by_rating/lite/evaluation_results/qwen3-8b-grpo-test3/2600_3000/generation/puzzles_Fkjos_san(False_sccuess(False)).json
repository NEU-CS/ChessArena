When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King positions: White's king is at g5, Black's king at f3. Both kings are active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: Black has pawns at a5 and e5. White has no pawns.\n\n4. Bishop activity: White's bishop at c6 is well-placed, controlling the long diagonal.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- Bishop moves: Many options, but need to consider how they affect the position\n- King moves: g5f6 or g5h6 seem most promising\n\nThe most pressing concern is the e5 pawn. If Black's king can capture this pawn, it will create a passed pawn that could be dangerous. Therefore, we need to either:\n1) Protect the e5 pawn with our king, or\n2) Prevent the black king from approaching the pawn\n\nLooking at the king moves:\n- g5f6: Moves towards the e5 pawn, but allows the black king to approach\n- g5h6: Moves away from the e5 pawn, not helpful\n\nLooking at bishop moves:\n- Many moves don't address the immediate concern\n- c6e4 looks interesting as it controls e4 and prevents the black king from moving to e4\n\nThe best move is to move the king towards the e5 pawn while maintaining control over key squares. Therefore:\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
