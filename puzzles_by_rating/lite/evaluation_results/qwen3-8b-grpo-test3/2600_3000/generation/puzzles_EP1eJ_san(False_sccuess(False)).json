When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on f8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a2, f3, g2. Black has pawns on a5, g6. The f3 pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on c3 is well-placed. Black's bishop is inactive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c3c8: Rook lift to the 8th rank\n- c3e3: Rook move towards the king\n- g1h2: King move to safety\n- h3h4: Pawn push to create space\n- f3f4: Pawn push to open lines\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. g1h2 moves the king towards safety while also opening the g-file for the rook if needed. Other moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng1h2\n```"
