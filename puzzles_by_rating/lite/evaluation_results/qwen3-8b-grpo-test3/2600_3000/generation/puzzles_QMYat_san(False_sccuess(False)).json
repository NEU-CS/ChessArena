When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f3. Black's king is on c4, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on a2 is attacking White's pawn on h3. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f3e4: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address the rook\n- f3g2: Moves king towards the h-pawn but still leaves the rook\n- f3e2: Moves king towards the rook\n- d6d2: Rook move attacking the rook\n- g4g5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on a2 attacking h3. If we don't address this, Black could play Ra1 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is to play d6d2, attacking the rook while also protecting the h3 pawn. This forces Black to move the rook or lose it.\n\n```\nd6d2\n```"
