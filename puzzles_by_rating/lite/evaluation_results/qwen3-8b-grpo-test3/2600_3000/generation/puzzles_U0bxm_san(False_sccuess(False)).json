When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on g3 is attacking the pawn on f2. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g1e3: Moves king towards the center and protects f2 pawn\n- g1f2: Moves king towards the pawn but leaves it exposed\n- b2c1: Bishop move but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d7f6: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- f3f4: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on g3 attacking f2. If we don't address this, Black could play Bxf2 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is g1e3 - it:\n- Moves the king towards the center\n- Protects the f2 pawn\n- Maintains flexibility for other pieces\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng1e3\n```"
