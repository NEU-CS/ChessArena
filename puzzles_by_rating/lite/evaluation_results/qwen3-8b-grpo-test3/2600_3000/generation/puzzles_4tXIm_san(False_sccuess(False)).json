When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is at h3, White's king at f3. Both kings are active but Black's king is slightly more exposed.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White has passed pawns at d5 and h4\n   - Black has pawns at a6, b7, c7, d6, h5\n   - The d5 pawn is isolated and could be a target\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - h3h4: Moves king towards the h-pawn but doesn't address other issues\n   - h3h2: Moves king towards the corner but away from the center\n   - c7c6: Creates a passed pawn and opens lines for Black's pawns\n   - b7b6: Similar to c7c6\n   - a6a5: Gains space on the queenside\n   - e5e4: Advances the e-pawn and opens lines for Black's pawns\n   - c7c5: Creates a passed pawn and opens lines\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be e5e4 or c7c5 as they:\n- Open lines for Black's pawns\n- Create passed pawns\n- Put pressure on White's position\n\nBetween these, e5e4 seems slightly better as it:\n- Opens the e-file for Black's pawns\n- Creates a passed e-pawn\n- Doesn't weaken Black's pawn structure as much as c7c5\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5e4\n```"
