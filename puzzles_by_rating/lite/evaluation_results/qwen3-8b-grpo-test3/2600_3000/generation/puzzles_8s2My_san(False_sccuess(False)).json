When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on c1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on h7 is attacking Black's bishop on g7. White's bishop on g6 is also a threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7h6: Capturing the queen with the bishop\n- e7h4: Moving the queen to safety\n- f5f7: Pushing the pawn to open lines\n- c3b2: Capturing the pawn\n- e4e3: Pushing the pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the queen on h7 attacking the bishop on g7. If we don't address this, White can capture the bishop with Qxg7.\n\nThe best move is to capture the queen with g7h6. This:\n- Removes the immediate threat to the bishop\n- Wins the queen for a bishop\n- Opens the h-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains material balance\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\ng7h6\n```"
