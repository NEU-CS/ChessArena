When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's Q+B+N+P). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on h5 is very active. Black's bishop on d5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on h5 is eyeing the g7 pawn. Black's knight on e7 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e7g5: Knight move attacking the knight\n- d5f3: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- d5e4: Bishop move centralizing\n- f7f5: Pawn move gaining space\n- h7h5: Pawn move kicking the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h5. If we don't address it, White could play Nxf6 or Nf3 with threats.\n\ne7g5 seems most appealing:\n- Attacks the knight\n- Opens the e5 square for Black's knight\n- If White moves the knight, we can consider f7f5 or d5f3\n- Maintains control over f3 square\n\nOther moves:\n- d5f3 is too slow\n- f7f5 weakens e5\n- h7h5 allows Nxf6\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7g5\n```"
