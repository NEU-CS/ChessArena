When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+B). White has a passed pawn on f6 that's very advanced.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on h1.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on g7 is attacking the rook on g8. White's rook on g3 is eyeing the g-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8h7: Moves the rook away from the bishop's attack\n- e8e1: Rook lift to attack the white king\n- c7e5: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- c5d4: Pawn capture\n- b4c3: Pawn capture\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the rook on g8. If we don't address this, White can play Bxh6 winning the pawn.\n\ng8h7 seems like the most straightforward move, moving the rook away from the bishop's attack while also protecting the h7 pawn. Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng8h7\n```"
