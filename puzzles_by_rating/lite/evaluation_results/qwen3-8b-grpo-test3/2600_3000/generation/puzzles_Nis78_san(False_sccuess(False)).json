When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on a4. Black's king is on d5, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on c3, g3. Black has pawns on d6, h5. The c3 pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on f5 is very active. Black's knight on g6 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f5g6: Capturing the knight with the bishop seems most appealing as it wins material\n- f5e6: Moving the bishop to control more squares\n- a4b5: Moving the king towards the center\n- a4a5: Moving the king forward\n\nThe most forcing move is f5g6, capturing the knight. After this:\n- White wins the knight\n- If black takes back with hxg6, white can play g3g4 gaining space\n- If black doesn't take, white can play moves like Bxh8 or Bf4\n\nOther moves don't improve white's position as much. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf5g6\n```"
