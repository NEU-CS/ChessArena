When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g3. Black's king is on g7.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on f4 is very active. Black's rook on d7 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's rook on c5 is attacking the pawn on b5. White's bishop on f4 is eyeing the g5 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d6f5: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- d6e4: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- d6c4: Knight move attacking the rook\n- f6f5: Pawn push creating space for the knight\n- b5b4: Pawn push attacking the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on c5 attacking the b5 pawn. If we don't address this, White can play Rc7 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is b5b4, pushing the pawn to defend against the rook while also opening lines for Black's pieces. This move:\n- Defends the b5 pawn\n- Opens the b-file for Black's rook\n- Creates potential for a knight move to c2 or d3\n- Maintains control over the center\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nb5b4\n```"
