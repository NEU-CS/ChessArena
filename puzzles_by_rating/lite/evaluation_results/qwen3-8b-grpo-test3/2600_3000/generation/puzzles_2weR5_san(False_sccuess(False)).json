When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on h5 is attacking the h7 pawn. White's bishop on f5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h7h6: Defends the h5 queen's attack on h7\n- d7g4: Attacks the queen\n- d7f5: Captures the bishop\n- Other moves don't seem to address immediate threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on f5 which is undefended and the queen on h5 attacking h7. The best move is to capture the bishop with d7f5, which:\n- Removes a strong piece from White\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e6\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new problems (like h7h6 which weakens g6).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd7f5\n```"
