King safety: White's king is exposed on c1. Black's king is on b8.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on e3 is eyeing the e6 pawn. Black's queen on g4 is well-placed.\n\n4.

If White takes e6 with Qxe6, White will gain a strong passed pawn. Therefore, we need to defend e6 or create counterplay.\n\ne6d5 seems most promising as it:\n- Defends the e6 pawn\n- Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n- Creates a passed d-pawn for Black\n- Maintains control over the center\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.
