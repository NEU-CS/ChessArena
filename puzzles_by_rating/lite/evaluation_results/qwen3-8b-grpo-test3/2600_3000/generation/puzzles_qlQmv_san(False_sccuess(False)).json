When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+Q). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on h6, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on f4 is eyeing the f7 pawn. Black's queen on d1 is attacking the a1 rook.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h6h7: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h6g6: Moves king towards the center and protects the g7 pawn\n- h6h5: Moves king towards the center\n- g7g5: Pushes the pawn to create space and potentially open lines for Black's pieces\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on f4. If White plays Qxg5, White would win the pawn and open lines towards Black's king. Therefore, we need to protect the g5 pawn.\n\ng7g5 is the best move because:\n1. It protects the pawn from Qxg5\n2. It creates space for Black's pieces\n3. It doesn't expose the king further\n4. It maintains control over the h4 square\n\nThe other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\ng7g5\n```"
