When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's P). White has a passed pawn on f6 that's very advanced.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e3. Black's king is on e6, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, b3, c2, f2, h3. Black has pawns on a6, b6, c5, d4, h5. The d4 pawn is isolated and vulnerable.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e6e7: King moves towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e6d7: King moves towards the queenside\n- f7f6: Captures the advanced pawn but opens the f-file for White's rook\n- b6b5: Gains space on the queenside\n- a6a5: Similar to b6b5\n- c5c4: Advances the pawn but leaves d4 pawn more exposed\n- d4d3: Advances the pawn but doesn't seem to help\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's f6 pawn which is very advanced and could promote if not addressed. Capturing it with f7f6 seems necessary, even though it opens the f-file. White doesn't have a rook yet, so this shouldn't be immediately dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf7f6\n```"
