When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f2. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on e6 is attacking the black rook on g8. Black's queen on g7 is eyeing the g3 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e6g8: Capturing the rook with the queen\n- e6e8: Moving queen to e8\n- e6f7: Moving queen to f7\n- c2g6: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- f4f5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on g8. If we don't take it, Black might play Rg8-f8 attacking our king. Taking the rook with e6g8 seems most urgent.\n\nAfter e6g8, if Black plays Qxg8, we can play Bg6 attacking the pawn. If Black doesn't take, we'll have a strong queen on g8.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6g8\n```"
