When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on b4. Black's king is on e8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on f4 is attacking the pawn on h4. White's rook on h7 is under attack by the black bishop on d1.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h7h8: Rook promotion, but black can capture with the king\n- h7f7: Moves rook away from attack\n- b4c5: Knight move that protects the rook\n- h4h5: Pawn push that protects the rook\n- a3a4: Pawn push that doesn't address immediate threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is protecting the rook on h7 while addressing the threat to h4 pawn. h4h5 seems most promising as it:\n- Protects the rook from the bishop\n- Advances the pawn which could be useful\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh4h5\n```"
