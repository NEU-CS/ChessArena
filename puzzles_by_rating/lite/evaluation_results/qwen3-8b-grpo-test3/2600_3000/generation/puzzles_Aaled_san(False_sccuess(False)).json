When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on e2. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black has a queen on h1 attacking White's rook on d1. White's rook on d1 is under attack.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e2e3: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address the immediate threat to the rook\n- e2d2: Moves king towards the rook but still leaves the rook under attack\n- d1d3: Moves the rook out of attack while also attacking the black bishop on e5\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the rook on d1. All moves leave the king exposed, but d1d3 is the most active response as it:\n- Gets the rook out of attack\n- Attacks the bishop on e5\n- Opens the d-file for White's rook\n- Maintains control over the d-file\n\nThe other moves don't address the immediate threat to the rook. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd1d3\n```"
