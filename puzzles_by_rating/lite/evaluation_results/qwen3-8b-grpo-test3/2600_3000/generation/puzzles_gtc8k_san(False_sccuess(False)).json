When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on c3 is attacking White's pawn on b2. White's rook on f4 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b2c3: Capturing the knight with the pawn seems most pressing - it removes the knight and opens the b-file for White's rook\n- c2f5: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- f4f7: Rook move attacking the bishop\n- e6g8: Bishop move attacking the king\n\nThe most immediate concern is the knight on c3 attacking the b2 pawn. If we don't address this, Black could play Nxb1 winning the queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the knight with b2c3. This:\n- Removes the knight\n- Opens the b-file for White's rook\n- Maintains control of the position\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems (like e6g8 leaving the king exposed).\n\n```\nb2c3\n```"
