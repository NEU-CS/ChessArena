When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and pawn (White has B+B+P+P+P vs Black's B+P+P). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on d5. Black's king is on f7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on b2, c3, g3, h2. Black has pawns on a4, b3, c4, g6, h7. The c4 pawn is isolated and vulnerable.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on c1 is very active. Black's bishop on g1 is passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g1e3: Develops the bishop to a more active square, attacking the c3 pawn\n- g1d4: Similar to e3, but less direct\n- g1c5: Attacks the c3 pawn\n- f7e7: Moves the king towards the center\n- a4a3: Advances the pawn, but doesn't help much\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's bishop on c1 which is very active. Developing the bishop to e3 or d4 would:\n- Improve Black's piece activity\n- Put pressure on White's pawns\n- Potentially open lines for Black's king to move towards the center\n\nBetween e3 and d4, e3 seems more flexible as it can attack the c3 pawn and also potentially move to f2 or d2 later.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng1e3\n```"
