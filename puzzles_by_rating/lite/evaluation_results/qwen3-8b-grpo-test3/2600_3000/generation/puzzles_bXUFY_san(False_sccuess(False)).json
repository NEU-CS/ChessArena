When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+Q+R+R vs Black's R+R+Q). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on h1 is attacking White's rook on e1. White's queen on d5 is attacking Black's rook on d8.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h1e1: Capturing the rook with the queen\n- d8d5: Capturing the queen with the rook\n- g4e5: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the rook and queen. If we don't address these threats immediately, White will gain more material.\n\nBetween h1e1 and d8d5, d8d5 seems better because:\n1. It captures the queen\n2. It opens the d-file for Black's rook\n3. It doesn't leave the h1 queen exposed\n\nAfter d8d5, if White takes with the bishop (Bxd5), Black can play h1e1 winning the rook. If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with other moves.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd8d5\n```"
