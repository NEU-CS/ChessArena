When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3,b3,c2,d2,f2,g2,h3. Black has pawns on a7,b7,c5,d5,e5,h6.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on b5 is very active. Black's knight on f6 and bishop on c5 are well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e5e4: Pawn push gains space and opens lines for Black's pieces\n- d5d4: Similar to e5e4\n- f6e4: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- c5e3: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- e8g8: Castling kingside would be good for king safety\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's bishop on b5, which is very active. Black needs to address this while also improving king safety.\n\nThe best move is to castle kingside, which:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Connects the rooks\n- Opens the h8-rook to potentially attack the h3 pawn\n- Maintains all other options\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
