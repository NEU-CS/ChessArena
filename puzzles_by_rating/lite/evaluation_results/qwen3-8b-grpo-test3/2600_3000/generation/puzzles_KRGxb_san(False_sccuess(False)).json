When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f1. Black's king is on g7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's queen and bishop are well-placed. Black's queen is active on d7.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7g8: King move doesn't seem helpful\n- g7f8: King move towards the center\n- g7h7: King move towards the edge\n- g7h6: King move towards the pawns\n- d7d4: Queen takes pawn, attacking the knight\n- f7f6: Pawn move, creating space for the king\n\nThe most promising move is d7d4 (Qxd4). This:\n- Wins the pawn\n- Attacks the knight on c4\n- Opens the d-file for Black's queen\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd7d4\n```"
