When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a pawn (White has Rook + Bishop, Black has Rook). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g7. White's king is on g2.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on b6 and c5. Black has pawns on a7, f5, h7.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on e7 is very active. Black's rook on c7 is passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f7g8: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f7f8: Similar to f7g8\n- f7e8: Moves king towards the center\n- f7g6: Moves king towards the pawns\n- f7f6: Moves king towards the center\n- f7e6: Moves king towards the center and away from potential checks\n- c7d7: Moves rook to defend the d-file\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on e7 which is attacking the black rook on c7. If the rook moves, White can play Re7xc7 winning the rook.\n\nTherefore, the only move that addresses this immediate threat is c7d7, moving the rook to defend the d-file and protecting the rook from capture.\n\n```\nc7d7\n```"
