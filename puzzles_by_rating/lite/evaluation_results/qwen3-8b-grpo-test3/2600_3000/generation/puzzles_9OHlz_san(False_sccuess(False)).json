When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a king and pawns. Black has a king, pawns, and a bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e3. Black's king is on e6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on d4, e3, g3, h3. Black has pawns on a5, b6, c5, d5, g7. The pawn structure is complex.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e3f4: Moves king towards the pawns but exposes it to checks\n- e3f3: Moves king towards the pawns\n- e3d3: Moves king towards the center\n- e3f2: Moves king towards the pawns\n- e3e2: Moves king towards the pawns\n- e3d2: Moves king towards the queenside\n- d4c5: Pawn capture, winning a pawn\n- d4d5: Pawn push, gaining space\n- h3h4: Pawn push, creating space for the king\n- g3g4: Pawn push, creating space for the king\n\nThe most promising move is d4c5 (d4xc5). This:\n- Captures a pawn\n- Opens the d-file for White's king to move towards the center\n- Removes a pawn from d5 that was restricting White's pieces\n- Maintains control over e5 square\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd4c5\n```"
