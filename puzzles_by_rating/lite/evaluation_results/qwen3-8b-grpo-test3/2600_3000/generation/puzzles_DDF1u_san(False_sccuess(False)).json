When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has R+N+B, Black has R+R+B). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g5, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on d4 is eyeing the d-file. Black's queen on b3 is attacking the e3 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b3e3: Capturing the pawn with the queen\n- b3d5: Moving the queen to defend the knight\n- h5g4: Pawn capture attacking the knight\n- b7d5: Rook move attacking the knight\n- h7h6: Pawn move creating space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on d7 which is undefended. Several moves address this:\n\n- b7d5 (Rook takes knight) is the most direct solution, winning the knight\n- b3e3 (Queen takes pawn) is also good, but doesn't address the knight\n- h5g4 (Pawn takes knight) is interesting but leaves the pawn structure weakened\n\nAfter considering all options, b7d5 (Rook takes knight) is the most forcing move, winning material while maintaining control of the position.\n\n```\nb7d5\n```"
