When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Q+R+2P vs Black's Q+R+2P+2B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e4. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on g2 is attacking White's rook on d2. White's queen on d4 is attacking Black's pawn on d5.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g2f3: Capturing the pawn with the queen while attacking the white queen\n- g2e2: Moving the queen to defend the rook\n- h5g4: Pawn capture that opens lines for Black's pieces\n- f7f5: Pawn move that creates space for Black's pieces\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the white rook. If we don't defend it, White can play Rd2-g2 winning the queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move the queen to e2 where it defends the rook while also maintaining pressure on the white queen.\n\n```\ng2e2\n```"
