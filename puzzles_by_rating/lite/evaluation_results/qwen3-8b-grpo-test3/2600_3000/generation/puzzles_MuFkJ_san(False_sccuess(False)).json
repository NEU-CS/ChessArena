When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+R). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on e3, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: \n   - Black's rook on g2 is attacking White's pawn on g2\n   - Black's knight on h4 is eyeing f3 and g6 squares\n   - White's rook on d5 is well-placed\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - g2g1: Capturing the pawn would win material\n   - h4f5: Knight move attacking the rook\n   - e3f4: King move attacking the pawn\n   - f6f5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on g2. If we don't address it, White can play Rg1 or other moves to defend. The move g2g1 (Rook takes pawn) wins a pawn and opens the g-file for Black's rook to attack White's king.\n\nOther moves:\n- h4f5 allows White to play Rd3 or other moves\n- e3f4 doesn't address the immediate threat\n- f6f5 is too slow\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the pawn with the rook:\n\n```\ng2g1\n```"
