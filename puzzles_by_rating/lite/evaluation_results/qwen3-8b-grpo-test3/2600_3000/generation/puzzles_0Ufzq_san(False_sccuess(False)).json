When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is at h8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's queen is well-placed at e4. White's knight at f3 is good. Black's knight at d6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's queen at e4 is attacking the pawn at e5. Black's bishop at e7 is eyeing the long diagonal.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e4c6: Queen takes knight - wins the knight\n- e4f5: Queen move - but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- f3g5: Knight move - but doesn't threaten anything\n- c1e3: Bishop move - develops the bishop\n- e1g1: Castles kingside - improves king safety\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king in the center. Castling kingside (e1g1) would:\n- Move the king to safety\n- Connect the rooks\n- Open the f1-h1 diagonal for the white bishop\n- Maintain control over e4\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is to castle kingside.\n\n```\ne1g1\n```"
