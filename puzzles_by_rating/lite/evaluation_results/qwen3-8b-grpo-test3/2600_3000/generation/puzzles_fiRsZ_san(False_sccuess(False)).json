When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on e8.\n\n3. Threats: Black has a rook on d1 attacking White's rook. Black also has a queen on d3 attacking the pawn on c3.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c1d1: Capturing the rook with the rook\n- f4f8: Queen move attacking the king\n- f4d6: Queen move attacking the knight\n- e4e5: Pawn push creating space\n- c3c4: Pawn move protecting the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on d1 attacking White's rook. If we don't address this, we'll lose the rook.\n\nc1d1 seems forced - we must capture the rook or move our rook. All other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\nAfter c1d1, if Black takes with rxd1, we can play Qf2 protecting the pawn. If Black doesn't take, we've eliminated the threat to our rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc1d1\n```"
