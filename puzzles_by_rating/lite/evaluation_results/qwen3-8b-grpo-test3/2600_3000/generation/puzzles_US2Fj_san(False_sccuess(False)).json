When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and a pawn. White has a king, two pawns, and a rook. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f2. Black's king is on g5, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: Black has pawns on e6 and d5. White has pawns on b3, g3, and a3. The e-pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's rook on d4 is well-placed. White's rook on a3 is inactive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e6e5: Advances the pawn, opens lines for the rook, and creates a passed pawn\n- d4d2: Attacks the king and could lead to checks\n- d4e4: Moves the rook to a more central position\n- f5g6: Moves the king towards the pawns\n\nThe most promising move is e6e5 because:\n1. It opens the e-file for Black's rook\n2. Creates a passed e-pawn that can be promoted\n3. Limits White's pawn moves (e.g., f2-f4 would be met with exf4)\n4. Maintains pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- d4d2 allows White to play Ke2\n- d4e4 doesn't improve the position\n- f5g6 is too slow\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6e5\n```"
