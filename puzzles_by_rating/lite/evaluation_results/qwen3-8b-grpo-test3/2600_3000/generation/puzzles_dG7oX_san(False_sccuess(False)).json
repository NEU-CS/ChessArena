When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King positions:\n- White king is exposed on d5\n- Black king is on g3, close to the white king\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White pawn on c7 is advanced and threatening\n- Black pawn on f2 is about to promote\n\n4. Immediate threats:\n- Black pawn on f2 is about to promote\n- White bishop on a6 is protecting the c7 pawn\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\nPromotion moves (f2f1q, f2f1r, f2f1b, f2f1n):\n- All these moves promote the pawn immediately\n- Queen promotion (f2f1q) is the most powerful\n\nOther moves:\n- Knight moves (c8e7, c8a7, c8d6, c8b6) don't address the immediate threat\n- King moves (f3g4, f3f4, f3e4, f3g3, f3e3, f3g2) don't help\n\nThe most pressing concern is the f2 pawn promoting. White has no way to stop this, so we should promote to a queen which gives us the most powerful piece.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf2f1q\n```"
