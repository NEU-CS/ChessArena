When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, pawns; Black has Queen, pawns). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on e8. White's king is on g3, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on g7 is attacking Black's pawn on g7. White's knight on f3 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8f8: Moves king towards the corner, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e8d8: Moves king towards the center\n- d2h6: Queen move attacking the rook\n- d2g5: Queen move attacking the knight\n- d2f4: Queen move centralizing\n- d2d4: Queen move attacking the pawn\n- b7b5: Pawn move creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on g7 attacking the g7 pawn. If the pawn falls, White's rook will be very active.\n\nThe best move is to play d2g5, attacking the knight on f3 while also protecting the g7 pawn. This move:\n- Attacks the knight\n- Protects the g7 pawn\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nd2g5\n```"
