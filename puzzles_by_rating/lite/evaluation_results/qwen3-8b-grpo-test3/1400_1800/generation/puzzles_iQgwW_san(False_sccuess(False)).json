When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's R+N+P). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has an advanced pawn on f4 that could be dangerous. Black has a pawn on d5 that's isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on g3 is well-placed. Black's knight on f5 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e8g8 (O-O): Castles kingside to safety\n- e7g5: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- f5h6: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- d5d4: Pawn push gaining space\n- g7g5: Pawn push creating space for the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is king safety. White's king is still in the center and could be vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, castling kingside (e8g8) seems like the most prudent move. It:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Connects the rooks\n- Opens the h8-rook to potentially attack the h-file\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new problems (like e7g5 which could leave the knight exposed).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
