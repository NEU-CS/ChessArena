When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: White has a rook on g4 attacking the g7 pawn. Black's knight on d3 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h7g6: Moves the rook to defend the g7 pawn and attacks the rook\n- h7f5: Moves the rook to a more active position\n- d3e5: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- c4c3: Pawn push creating passed pawn\n- a8e8: Rook move centralizing\n\nThe most pressing concern is defending the g7 pawn while also creating counterplay. h7g6 seems most flexible:\n- Defends the g7 pawn\n- Attacks the rook on g4\n- Opens the h-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over f5 square\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- h7f5 leaves g7 undefended\n- d3e5 doesn't address the immediate threats\n- c4c3 is too slow\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh7g6\n```"
