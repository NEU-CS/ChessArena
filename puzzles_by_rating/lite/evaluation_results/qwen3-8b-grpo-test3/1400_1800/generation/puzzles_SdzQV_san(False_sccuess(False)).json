When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, pawns. Black has a rook, bishop, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on f5 is very active. Black's queen on g6 and rook on f8 are well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: Black's queen on g6 is eyeing the g2 pawn. White's knight on f5 is close to Black's king.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f5g7: Knight takes bishop, but allows Black's rook to capture the knight\n- f5e7: Knight move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- f5h6: Knight move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- f5d6: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f5h4: Knight move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- f5d4: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f5g3: Knight move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- f5e3: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- e4a8: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- e4b7: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to help\n- e4c6: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to help\n- e4d5: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f3g4: Queen move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f3h3: Queen move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f3g3: Queen move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f3e3: Queen move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f3g2: Queen move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f3e2: Queen move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f3h1: Queen move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f3d1: Queen move, but doesn't seem to help\n- g1h2: King move, but doesn't seem to help\n- g1g2: King move, but doesn't seem to help\n- g1h1: King move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f1e1: Rook move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f1d1: Rook move, but doesn't seem to help\n- c1c3: Rook move, but doesn't seem to help\n- c1c2: Rook move, but doesn't seem to help\n- c1e1: Rook move, but doesn't seem to help\n- c1d1: Rook move, but doesn't seem to help\n- c1b1: Rook move, but doesn't seem to help\n- c1a1: Rook move, but doesn't seem to help\n- f4g5: Pawn move, but doesn't seem to help\n- d3d4: Pawn move, but doesn't seem to help\n- a2a3: Pawn move, but doesn't seem to help\n- a2a4: Pawn move, but doesn't seem to help\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move seems to be f5g7, capturing the bishop on g7. This move:\n- Wins the bishop\n- Opens the g-file for White's rook\n- Doesn't immediately expose White's king\n- Maintains the active position of the knight\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf5g7\n```"
