When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on h4 is eyeing the g6 pawn. Black's knight on g5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g5e6: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- g5f3: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- b2g2: Rook move attacking the knight\n- e5e4: Pawn push gaining space\n- d6d5: Pawn push opening lines\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on h4. If it moves to g6, it could be dangerous. The move g5f3 (knight move) both attacks the bishop and prepares to defend against Nh6 ideas.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5f3\n```"
