When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on e7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on b6 is eyeing the a2 pawn. Black's knight on b5 is close to White's pawns.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c1e3: Develops the bishop to an active square, protecting d2 pawn\n- c1f4: Also develops the bishop\n- b1d2: Develops the knight\n- d4e5: Pawn capture, opening lines for White's pieces\n- a8e4: Queen move, but seems too aggressive\n\nThe most promising move is d4e5, capturing the pawn. This:\n- Opens the d-file for White's rook\n- Opens the e5 square for White's knight\n- Removes a central pawn from Black\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new problems (like c1e3 which leaves the d2 pawn unprotected). Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd4e5\n```"
