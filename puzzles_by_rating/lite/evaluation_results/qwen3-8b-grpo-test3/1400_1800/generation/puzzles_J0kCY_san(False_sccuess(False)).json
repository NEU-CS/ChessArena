When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is exposed on g5. Black's king is on d7. Both kings are active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on g2 and f2. Black has pawns on h6, g5, e4, and a3. The e4 pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g5h6: Captures the h6 pawn but leaves the king exposed\n- g5g6: Moves king towards the center\n- g5f6: Moves king towards the e4 pawn\n- g5f4: Moves king towards the e4 pawn\n- g2g3/f2f3/g2g4/f2f4: Pawn moves that don't address immediate concerns\n\nThe most pressing concern is the e4 pawn which is advanced and could promote if not addressed. Both g5f6 and g5f4 move the king towards this pawn. g5f4 seems better as it also keeps options open to move towards the h6 pawn if needed.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5f4\n```"
