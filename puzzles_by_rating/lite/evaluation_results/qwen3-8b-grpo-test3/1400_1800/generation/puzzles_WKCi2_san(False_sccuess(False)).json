When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a queen for a rook and bishop (White has Q+R+N+P vs Black's R+B+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is also in the center (g1).\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on c7 is attacking Black's pawn on e7. White's knight on e5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d8e6: Queen takes pawn, but White's queen is still on c7\n- a3d6: Knight move attacking the queen\n- g7e5: Bishop takes knight\n- e7e6: Pawn push creating space for the king\n- f7f5: Pawn push creating space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on c7 attacking the e7 pawn. If we don't address this, White can play Qxe7 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is to play g7e5 (Bishop takes knight). This:\n- Removes the knight from e5\n- Opens the g1-h2 diagonal for Black's bishop\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Maintains control over e5\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\ng7e5\n```"
