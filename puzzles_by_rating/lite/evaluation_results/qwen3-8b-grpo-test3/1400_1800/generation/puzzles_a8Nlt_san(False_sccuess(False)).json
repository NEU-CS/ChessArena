When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h2. Black's king is on f6, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on h6 is attacking Black's knight on c6. White's queen on b6 is also a threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e6f7: Moves the knight to f7, but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- e6e7: Moves the knight to e7, but still leaves the knight under attack\n- e6d7: Moves the knight to d7, but doesn't help\n- e6f5: Moves the knight to f5, but doesn't address the main issues\n- e6e5: Moves the knight to e5, but still leaves the knight under attack\n- d4f6: This is the most interesting move - it captures the pawn on f6 with the queen, opening up the f-file for Black's rook (if there was one) and also removing a defender from the knight on c6.\n\nThe best move is d4f6 because:\n1. It captures a pawn\n2. It opens lines for Black's pieces\n3. It removes a defender from the knight on c6\n4. It maintains some counterplay despite the material deficit\n\n```\nd4f6\n```"
