When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+Q+R vs Black's R+Q+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on a1.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on h5 is attacking the g7 pawn. White's queen on e5 is well-placed. Black's bishop on f3 is attacking the h1 square.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f3g4: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- d7e6: Queen move attacking the queen\n- c4b3: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- e4e3: Pawn push creating threats\n- g7g6: Pawn move protecting the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on h5 which is attacking the g7 pawn. If g7 falls, White's knight will be very active.\n\nThe best move is to play g7g6, which:\n- Protects the g7 pawn from the knight\n- Creates a shelter for Black's king\n- Opens the g-file for Black's rook if needed\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems (like f3g4 which would leave the h1 square vulnerable).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng7g6\n```"
