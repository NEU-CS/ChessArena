When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on f8.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on d5 is attacking Black's rook on c8. White's queen on e5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8f8: Moves the king towards the center but doesn't address the immediate threat to the rook\n- g6e6: Captures the rook with the knight, winning the piece\n- b6e6: Captures the rook with the queen, also winning the piece\n\nBetween g6e6 and b6e6, b6e6 (queen takes rook) is better because:\n- It maintains the knight on g6 which is well-placed\n- The queen can then support the knight and other pieces\n- It keeps the bishop on c8 which is useful for defense\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb6e6\n```"
