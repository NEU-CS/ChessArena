When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop pair, knight, pawns. Black has a knight, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (g1). Black's king is also in the center (g8).\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on c4 is very active. Black's knight on g6 and bishop on e7 are well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on f3 is eyeing the e5 square. Black's knight on g6 is close to White's pawns.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c4f7: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Kxf7\n- c4e6: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- f3g5: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- c3d5: Knight move centralizing\n- c1e3: Bishop move developing the bishop\n- g4g5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most promising move seems to be c3d5 (Nxd5). This:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Opens the c1-h6 diagonal for White's bishop\n- Prepares potential knight jumps to e3 or f4\n- Doesn't weaken any pawns\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
