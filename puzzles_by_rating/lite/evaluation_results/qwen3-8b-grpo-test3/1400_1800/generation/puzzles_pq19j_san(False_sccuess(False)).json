When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h6, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's rook on e5 is very active. Black's rook on d6 and knight on d5 are well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's rook on e5 is attacking the knight on d5. Black needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d5e3: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- d5f4: Knight move attacking the rook\n- d6e6: Rook move attacking the rook\n- c5b6: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- d4d3: Pawn push creating threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the knight. If we don't address it, White may win the knight.\n\nd5f4 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the rook on f3\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e5\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5f4\n```"
