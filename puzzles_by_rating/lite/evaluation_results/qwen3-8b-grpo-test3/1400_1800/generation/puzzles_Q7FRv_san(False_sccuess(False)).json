When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's rook on e1 is well-placed. Black's queen on f6 is active.\n\n4. Threats: White's bishop on g4 is eyeing the h5 pawn. White's queen on g3 is close to Black's king.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f6g5: Queen move attacking the bishop\n- e6f5: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- c6e5: Knight move centralizing\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating luft for the king\n- d5d4: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's bishop on g4 threatening h5 and the potential for a back-rank mate. The best move is to create an escape square for the king with g7g6.\n\n```\ng7g6\n```"
