When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, pawns. Black has a queen, rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on f3 is attacking White's pawn on g2. White's queen on h6 is close to Black's queen on g8.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h6h7: Queen takes pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat to g2\n- h6g7: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6f6: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6e6: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6h5: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6g5: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6h4: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6f4: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6h3: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6e3: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6h2: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6d2: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h6c1: Queen move, but doesn't help\n- h1h2: King move, but doesn't help\n- h1g1: King move, but doesn't help\n- d6d7: Pawn push, this is interesting as it threatens to promote\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on f3 attacking g2. None of the queen moves address this immediately. The pawn push d6d7 is the most promising move as it:\n- Creates a passed pawn that will promote soon\n- Opens lines for White's pieces\n- Forces Black to respond\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd6d7\n```"
