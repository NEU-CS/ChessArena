When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and two pawns. Black has a knight, a bishop (promoted pawn), and three pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b3. Black's king is on e5, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on b4, c4, d4, g5. Black has pawns on a3, b6, a4, h2. The pawn structure is complex.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on g3 is well-placed. Black's knight on f6 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g3h5: Knight move attacking the pawn, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- g3e2: Knight move towards the king, but doesn't help\n- g3f1: Knight move towards the corner\n- b3a4: King move capturing the pawn\n- b3c3: King move towards the center\n- b3a3: King move towards the a-pawn\n- b3c2: King move towards the center\n- b3a2: King move towards the a-pawn\n- c4c5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the a3 pawn which is close to promoting. If White doesn't address it, Black can play a2 promoting to a queen. Therefore, capturing the pawn with b3a4 seems most urgent.\n\n```\nb3a4\n```"
