When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+B+R+R vs Black's R+R+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White has a queen on g4 attacking the pawn on g5. White's rook on f1 is eyeing the f-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f6g5: Capturing the pawn with the queen seems most pressing, as it opens the g-file for White's rook\n- g7g5: Pushing the pawn to defend against Qxg5\n- e6e5: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n- c4e5: Bishop move attacking the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on g4. If White plays Qxg5, White will have a strong passed pawn on g5. Therefore, we need to address this immediate threat.\n\nBetween f6g5 and g7g5, f6g5 (Qxg5) is better because:\n1. It captures the pawn\n2. It opens the g-file for Black's rook\n3. It maintains control over e5\n4. It doesn't weaken the g-pawn structure like g7g5 would\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
