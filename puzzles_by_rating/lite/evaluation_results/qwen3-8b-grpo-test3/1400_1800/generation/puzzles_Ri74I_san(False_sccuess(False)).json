When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e3. Black's king is on d5, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a2, b3, f4, g3. Black has pawns on a4, b4, b5, g5, h6. The pawn structure is complex with potential passed pawns.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e3f3: Moves king towards the pawns but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e3d3: Moves king towards the center\n- e3f2: Moves king towards the kingside pawns\n- e3e2: Moves king towards the queenside pawns\n- e3d2: Moves king towards the queenside pawns\n- f4e5: Pawn capture, but black knight protects e5\n- f4f5: Pawn advance, but doesn't seem to help\n- h3h4: Pawn advance, but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- g3g4: Pawn advance, but doesn't help\n- a2a3/a2a4: Pawn moves, but don't seem to help\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. Moving it towards the center with e3d3 seems most prudent, as it:\n- Gets the king out of the open e-file\n- Moves towards the center where it can be more active\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3d3\n```"
