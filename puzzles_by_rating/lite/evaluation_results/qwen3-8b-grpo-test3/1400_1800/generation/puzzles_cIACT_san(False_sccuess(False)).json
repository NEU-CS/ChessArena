When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, pawns. Black has a bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on e7.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's rook on f1 is well-placed. White's knight on e2 is inactive. Black's bishop on c6 is very active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's bishop on c6 is eyeing the pawn on d3. White's knight on e2 needs to find a better square.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e2d4: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- e2c3: Knight move developing the knight\n- f1f7: Rook move attacking the pawn\n- b3e6: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- h3h4: Pawn move creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e2 which needs to find a better square. e2d4 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the bishop on c6\n- Opens the d-file for the rook\n- Moves the knight to a more active square\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne2d4\n```"
