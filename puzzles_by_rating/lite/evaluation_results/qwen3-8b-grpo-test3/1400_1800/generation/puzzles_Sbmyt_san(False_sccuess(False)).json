When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+N+B, Black has B). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on e5 is very active. Black's knight on c5 is also well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on e5 is attacking the pawn on d7. Black needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e8g8 (O-O): Castles kingside to safety\n- e8d7: Moves king to defend the pawn\n- c5e6: Knight move attacking the knight\n- g7e5: Bishop takes knight\n- f7f5: Pawn push to gain space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e5. If we don't address it, White can play Nxd7 or Nf3 with strong threats.\n\nThe best move is g7e5 (Bishop takes knight). This:\n- Removes the active knight\n- Opens the g-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over d4\n- Doesn't weaken Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\ng7e5\n```"
