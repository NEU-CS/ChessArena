When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a queen and bishop for a rook (White has Q+K+P, Black has K+R+R). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h6. Black's king is on f7.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on d7 is attacking Black's rook on d5. White's pawn on f2 is threatening to promote.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e7f8: Moves the king towards the corner but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e7e8: Moves the king towards the queen but still leaves the rook under attack\n- e7f6: Moves the king towards the center but doesn't help\n- d5d7: Captures the queen with the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the queen on d7 attacking the rook on d5. If we don't address this, White can capture the rook with Qxd5.\n\nThe only move that both defends the rook and creates counterplay is d5d7, capturing the queen. After this:\n- White would likely play f2f4 to protect the pawn\n- Black could then play Rxd7, leaving White with a passed pawn but reducing material imbalance\n\nOther moves leave the rook under attack or don't address the immediate threat. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5d7\n```"
