When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Materially, White has a significant advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on h4 is very active. Black's pieces are somewhat cramped.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on h4 is eyeing the g6 pawn. White's bishop on d3 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f6e5: Knight move attacking the pawn and opening lines\n- c5d4: Pawn capture winning the knight\n- c6d4: Knight capture winning the knight\n- Other moves don't seem to address the immediate threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on h4. If we don't address it, White could play Nxf5 or Nf3 with strong threats.\n\nBetween c5d4 and c6d4, c6d4 (knight takes knight) is better because:\n- It wins the knight\n- Opens the c-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e5\n- Doesn't open the c-file for White's rook\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc6d4\n```"
