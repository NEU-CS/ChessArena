When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+B+R+Q vs Black's R+B+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on h2, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on h4 is eyeing the g5 pawn. White's queen on e3 is well-placed. Black's rook on e4 is under attack by White's bishop.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4g6: Rook move attacking the knight\n- e4f5: Rook move attacking the bishop\n- e4d5: Rook move centralizing\n- h7f6: Knight move attacking the queen\n- g7g6: Pawn move kicking the bishop\n- d6d5: Pawn move opening the center\n\nThe most pressing concern is the safety of the rook on e4. Several moves address this:\n\n- e4f5 attacks the bishop while moving the rook to a safer square\n- e4d5 centralizes the rook\n- h7f6 attacks the queen while protecting the rook\n\nAfter considering all options, the most flexible move is e4f5, which:\n- Moves the rook to a safer square\n- Attacks the bishop on h4\n- Maintains control over the e-file\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne4f5\n```"
