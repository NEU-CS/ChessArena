When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, two knights, a bishop, pawns. Black has a queen, two bishops, a knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's queen on f3 is well-placed. Black's queen on d7 and bishop on e7 are active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's knight on f6 is eyeing the g2 pawn. White's pawn on g2 is isolated.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c1e3: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- c3e4: Knight move centralizing\n- f3e4: Queen move attacking the knight\n- a1a7: Rook move attacking the rook\n- h3h4: Pawn move creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on f6. If it moves to g4 or e4, it could cause problems. The move c3e4 (Nxe4) seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the knight\n- Opens the c1-h6 diagonal for the bishop\n- Maintains control of the center\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc3e4\n```"
