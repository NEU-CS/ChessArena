When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Rook, Bishop, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's rooks are well-placed. Black's rooks need to be more active.\n\n4. Threats: White has a passed pawn on e4 that could be dangerous. Black's queen on d4 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d4e5: Queen move attacking the pawn\n- d4f6: Queen move attacking the pawn\n- d4d7: Rook move attacking the rook\n- f7f5: Pawn move creating space\n- e7e5: Pawn move opening lines\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's e-pawn which could promote if not addressed. The move e7e5 (pawn push) seems most promising as it:\n- Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n- Creates a passed pawn on e5\n- Limits White's e-pawn advancement\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new problems (like d4d7 which would expose the rook).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7e5\n```"
