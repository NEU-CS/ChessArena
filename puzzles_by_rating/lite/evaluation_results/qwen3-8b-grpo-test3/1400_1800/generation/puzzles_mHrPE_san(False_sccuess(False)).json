When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on d1. Black's king is on e8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on f2 is attacking White's knight on g1. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c4e2: Bishop move, but doesn't address the queen attack\n- g1f3: Knight move, but doesn't help\n- g1e2: Knight move that blocks the queen's attack on f2\n\nThe most pressing concern is the queen attacking the knight on g1. All moves leave the knight under attack. However, g1e2 (Nxe2) is the best option because:\n1. It blocks the queen's attack on f2\n2. It opens the e-file for White's rook\n3. It maintains control over key squares\n4. Other moves don't address the immediate threat\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng1e2\n```"
