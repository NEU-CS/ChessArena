When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on h4 is very active. Black's knight on d5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's queen on e4 is eyeing the e5 pawn. White's bishop on h4 is threatening to capture the g5 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f4g5: Capturing the pawn with the bishop seems most pressing, as it opens the f-file for Black's rook and removes a pawn from White's bishop.\n- d5e3: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- f7f5: Pawn push to gain space\n- g7g5: Pawn push to kick the bishop\n\nThe most immediate concern is the bishop on h4. If we don't address it, White can play Bxg5 or Bf3 with strong threats.\n\nf4g5 (Bxg5) seems best because:\n1. It captures a pawn\n2. Opens the f-file for Black's rook\n3. Removes the pawn that was protecting the knight on d5\n4. If White plays Bxg5, we can play Nxf6 with a strong knight\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf4g5\n```"
