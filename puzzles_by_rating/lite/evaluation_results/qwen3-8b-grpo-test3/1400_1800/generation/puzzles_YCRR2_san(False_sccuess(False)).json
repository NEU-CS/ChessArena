When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h4. Black's king is on g6.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on g1 is attacking White's pawn on f3. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b4b8: Rook move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b4b7: Similar to above\n- b4b6: Same issue\n- b4b5: Same\n- b4d4: Moves rook towards the center\n- b4c4: Same\n- b4b3: Moves rook towards the king\n- b4b2: Same\n- b4b1: Moves rook towards the corner\n- e4e5: Pawn push, but doesn't help\n- a4a5: Pawn push, but doesn't help\n- f3f4: This is the most important move - it protects the f3 pawn from the rook while also opening lines for White's pieces\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the f3 pawn by the black rook. If we don't protect it, Black could capture the pawn and gain the initiative.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf3f4\n```"
