When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on f4, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on d4 is attacking the pawn on e4. Black's rook on e3 is eyeing the e-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e7e8: Rook promotion? But there's no pawn on e7 to promote.\n- e7h7: Rook move, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n- e7f7: Rook move, similar to above.\n- d5g8: Bishop move, but doesn't help.\n- d5e6: Bishop move that attacks the knight.\n- e4e5: Pawn push that opens the e-file for White's rook and protects the pawn.\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on d4 attacking e4 pawn. If we don't address this, Black could play Nxe2 or Nxf2.\n\nThe best move is e4e5, which:\n- Protects the e4 pawn\n- Opens the e-file for White's rook\n- Creates space for White's pieces\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems.\n\n```\ne4e5\n```"
