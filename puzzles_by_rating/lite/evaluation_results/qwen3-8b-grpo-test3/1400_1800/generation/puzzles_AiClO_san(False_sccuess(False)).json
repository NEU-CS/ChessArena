When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+B+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is also uncastled (g1).\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on g5 is attacking the pawn on f7. White's queen on d4 is eyeing the d-file. Black's knight on h4 is well-placed but needs support.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g4e5: Knight move attacking the pawn and opening lines for Black's bishop\n- g4f6: Knight move attacking the knight\n- d7f5: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- e4f3: Pawn capture winning the knight\n- f7f6: Pawn move kicking the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on g5 which is attacking f7. If we don't address this, White could play Nxf7 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is e4f3, capturing the knight with the pawn. This:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over f3\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne4f3\n```"
