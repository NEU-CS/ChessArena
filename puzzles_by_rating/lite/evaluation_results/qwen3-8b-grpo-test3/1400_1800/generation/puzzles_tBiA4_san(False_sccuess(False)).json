Piece activity: White's rook on c1 is well-placed. Black's bishop on c8 is currently inactive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c8e6: Bishop move that attacks the pawn and opens lines\n- c8f5: Similar to e6\n- b2c1: Capturing the rook would be winning\n- Other moves are less interesting\n\nThe most forcing move is b2c1, capturing the rook. After this:\n- White has no pieces left\n- Black can promote the a-pawn or b-pawn\n- White's g-pawn is too slow to promote\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the rook:\n\n```\nb2c1\n```"
