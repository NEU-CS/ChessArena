When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is also in the center (e1).\n\n3. Threats: White has a knight on c4 attacking the pawn on d6. Black's queen on g4 is eyeing the h2 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8g8 (O-O): Castles kingside to get the king to safety\n- e8c8: Castles queenside\n- e7f6: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- f4h6: Queen move attacking the h2 pawn\n- g4h5: Queen move attacking the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is king safety and development. White's knight on c4 is well-placed and Black needs to address it.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is to castle kingside, getting the king to safety and connecting the rooks.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
