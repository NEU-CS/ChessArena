When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+Q+P vs Black's R+R+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed at d2. Black's king is at c6, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on e7 is attacking Black's rook on h8. White's queen on g7 is also a threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c6d7: Moves king towards the knight but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- c6c7: Moves king towards the queen but still leaves the knight attacking the rook\n- c6b7: Moves king towards the knight but doesn't help\n- c6d6: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address threats\n- c6b6: Moves king towards the knight but doesn't help\n- c6b5: Moves king towards the knight but doesn't address threats\n- e5e7: Captures the knight with the queen, eliminating the immediate threat to the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e7 attacking the rook on h8. If we don't address this, White can play Nxh8 winning the rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the knight with the queen:\n\n```\ne5e7\n```"
