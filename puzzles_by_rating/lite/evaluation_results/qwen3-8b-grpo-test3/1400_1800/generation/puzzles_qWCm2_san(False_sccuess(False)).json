When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on c2 is attacking White's bishop on e2. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b7c8: Queen takes rook - but black's queen is on d8\n- b7f7: Queen move - but doesn't address the rook\n- b7e4: Queen move - but doesn't help\n- g2f2: King move - but doesn't help\n- h1c1: Rook move - but doesn't help\n- b7b2: Queen move - but doesn't help\n- b7d5: Queen move - but doesn't help\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on c2 attacking the bishop. The only move that addresses this while also creating threats is:\n\n```\nb7c6\n```\n\nThis move:\n1. Moves the queen to c6 where it's safe\n2. Attacks the pawn on d5\n3. Maintains control over the center\n4. Doesn't expose the white king further\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, b7c6 is the best choice."
