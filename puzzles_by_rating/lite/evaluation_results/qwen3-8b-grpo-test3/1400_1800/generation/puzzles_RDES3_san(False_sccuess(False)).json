When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b3. Black's king is on g3, also exposed.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on f4 is attacking White's rook on e7. White's rook on e7 is protecting the pawn on e2.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f4e4: Capturing the pawn with the rook\n- f4d4: Moving the rook to defend the king\n- g3h4: Moving the king towards the center\n- d8d7: Moving the rook to defend the pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on e7 which is attacking Black's rook on d8. If White captures the rook with Re7xd8, White will be up a rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the pawn with the rook while also defending against White's threats:\n\n```\nf4e4\n```"
