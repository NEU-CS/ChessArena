When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on d4. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on g3 and h2. Black has pawns on a4, g6, and h7.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on c7 is very active. Black's bishop on b4 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b4c5: Bishop move attacking the king\n- b4d6: Bishop move\n- b4e7: Bishop move\n- g6g5: Pawn push creating space\n- h7h5: Pawn push creating space\n- a4a3: Pawn push attacking the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's king on d4. Several moves address this:\n\n- b4c5 directly attacks the king\n- a4a3 also attacks the king\n- g6g5 creates space for the king to move\n\nAmong these, b4c5 seems most forcing as it immediately threatens the king and forces a response. White would need to move the king or defend against the bishop's attack.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb4c5\n```"
