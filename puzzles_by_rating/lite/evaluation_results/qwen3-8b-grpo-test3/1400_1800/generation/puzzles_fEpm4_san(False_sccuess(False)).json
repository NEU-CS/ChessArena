When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Materially, White is ahead.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on b6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on d3 is eyeing the d-file. Black's queen on b2 is attacking the pawn on e2.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b2f2: Queen takes pawn, attacking the rook\n- b2e2: Queen takes pawn\n- b2d2: Queen moves towards the center\n- c3c2: Pawn push, creating a passed pawn\n- h7h5: Pawn push, gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on d3. If we don't address it, White could play Qd2 or Qe2 with threats.\n\nThe best move is b2f2, capturing the pawn and attacking the rook. This:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Opens the f-file for Black's rook\n- Creates threats against White's rook\n- Maintains pressure on the queen\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nb2f2\n```"
