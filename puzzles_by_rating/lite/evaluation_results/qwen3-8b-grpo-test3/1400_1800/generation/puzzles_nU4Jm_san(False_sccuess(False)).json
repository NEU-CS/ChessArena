When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a queen and bishop for a knight (White has Q+N+R vs Black's R+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on c8. White's king is on a2, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on c6 is attacking Black's rook on c7. White's queen on b6 is also a threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c7d7: Moves the rook away from the knight's attack\n- c5d7: Moves the knight to defend the rook\n- e4f6: Moves the knight to a safer square\n- d1h5: Moves the queen to attack the h-pawn\n- h6h5: Moves the pawn to gain space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on c6 attacking the rook on c7. If the rook isn't moved or defended, it will be captured.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- c7d7 moves the rook but leaves it exposed\n- c5d7 moves the knight to defend the rook while also attacking the knight on c6\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threat\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move the knight to d7, defending the rook while also attacking White's knight.\n\n```\nc5d7\n```"
