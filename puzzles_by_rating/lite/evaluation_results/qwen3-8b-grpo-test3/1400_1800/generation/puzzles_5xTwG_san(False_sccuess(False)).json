When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has R+N+P vs Black's R+B+P). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on b1.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has an advanced pawn on c5 that's cramping Black's position. Black has pawns on b5, d5, e6 that are somewhat blocked.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on g3 is well-placed. Black's bishop on c7 is inactive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c7e5: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- c7d6: Bishop move controlling e5\n- a8f8: Rook move preparing to defend the king\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating space for the king\n- f7f5: Pawn move gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on g3 which is eyeing the h5 pawn and could potentially attack Black's king. The bishop move c7e5 both attacks the knight and opens the diagonal for Black's bishop.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc7e5\n```"
