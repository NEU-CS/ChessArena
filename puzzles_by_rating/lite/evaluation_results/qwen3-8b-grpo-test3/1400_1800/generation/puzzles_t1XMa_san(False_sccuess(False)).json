When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Bishop, pawns).\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on d3. Black's king is on h7.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on g4 is attacking the knight on e3. White's queen on c3 is eyeing the pawn on c6.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g4e4: Rook takes pawn, attacking the knight\n- f3e4: Queen takes pawn\n- d6e5: Bishop move\n- f7f5: Pawn push\n- g7g5: Pawn push\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e3 which is undefended. If we take the pawn with g4e4, we also attack the knight. White would likely play Nxf5 or Nxd5.\n\nAlternatively, f3e4 (Qe4) attacks the pawn and prepares to bring the queen to e3 or d3.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to take the pawn with the rook while attacking the knight:\n\n```\ng4e4\n```"
