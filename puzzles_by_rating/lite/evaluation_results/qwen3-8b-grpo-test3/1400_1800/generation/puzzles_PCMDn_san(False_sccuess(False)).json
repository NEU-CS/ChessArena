When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on d5 is eyeing the e4 pawn. Black's bishop on g7 is controlling the long diagonal.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c2e4: Capturing the pawn with the queen seems most pressing - it wins material and opens lines for White's pieces.\n- e3e4: Pushing the pawn would also challenge the queen but doesn't win material immediately.\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threats or create new threats.\n\nThe most forcing move is c2e4, capturing the pawn and attacking the queen. After this:\n- If Qxe4, then Bxg5 wins the pawn\n- If Q moves away, White can play e3e4 or other developing moves\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc2e4\n```"
