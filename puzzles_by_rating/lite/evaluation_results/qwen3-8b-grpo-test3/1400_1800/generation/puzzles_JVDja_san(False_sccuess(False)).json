When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, pawns. Black has a rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on g7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on d5 and a3. Black has pawns on a2, g5, h6.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on c6 is very active. White's bishop on b3 is well-placed.\n\n5. Threats: Black's rook on c8 is eyeing the c-file. White's pawn on d5 is advanced.\n\nLooking at the candidate moves:\n\n- c6e7: Knight move attacking the pawn, but doesn't seem to gain much\n- c6d4: Knight move centralizing\n- d5d6: Pawn advance creating a passed pawn\n- b3c4: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- f2f4: Pawn move gaining space\n\nThe most promising move seems to be d5d6, advancing the passed pawn. This:\n- Creates a passed pawn on d6\n- Opens lines for White's pieces\n- Limits Black's options\n- Maintains pressure on the position\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5d6\n```"
