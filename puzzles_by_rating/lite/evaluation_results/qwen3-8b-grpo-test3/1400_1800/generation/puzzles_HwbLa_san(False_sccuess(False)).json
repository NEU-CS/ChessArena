When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Q+R+B+P vs Black's Q+B+P). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h6. White's king is on h1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on d5 is attacking the black queen on f6. White's rook on g5 is also a threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f6d8: Moves queen to safety but doesn't address other threats\n- f6e7: Moves queen but still leaves it exposed\n- f6g5: Captures the rook - this seems most pressing\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on g5 which is attacking the black queen. Capturing it with f6g5 seems mandatory as:\n- If we don't take the rook, White can play Rxf5 or Rg6+\n- After f6g5, if White plays Qxf5, we can play Qxf5\n- This reduces material imbalance and removes an active piece\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
