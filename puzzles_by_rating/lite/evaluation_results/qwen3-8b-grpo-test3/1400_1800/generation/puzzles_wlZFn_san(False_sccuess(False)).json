When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on c4 is very active. Black's knight on d5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's queen on d3 is eyeing the d-file. Black's rook on d8 is under attack by White's rook on c1.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d8d7: Defends the rook and opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- e7g5: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- c6e8: Knight move attacking the rook\n- d5f6: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- f7f5: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is defending the rook on d8 while also creating counterplay. d8d7 seems most flexible:\n- It defends the rook\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- Doesn't weaken any pawns\n- Maintains control over e7\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- e7g5 leaves the rook undefended\n- c6e8 allows White's rook to capture the knight\n- d5f6 doesn't address the immediate threat to the rook\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd8d7\n```"
