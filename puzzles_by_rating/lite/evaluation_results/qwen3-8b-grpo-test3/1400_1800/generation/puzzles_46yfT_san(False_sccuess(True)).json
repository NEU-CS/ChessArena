When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a bishop on f7 that's very active.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is also uncastled (e1).\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on e5 is very strong. White's queen on g4 is eyeing the g7 pawn. White's bishop on g5 is pinning the knight to the queen.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8f8: Moves the king towards the castled position\n- e8d8: Moves the king towards the queenside\n\nThe more pressing concern is White's bishop on f7 which is attacking the black king. If White plays Bxh8, Black would lose the rook. Therefore, we need to move the king away from the f-file.\n\ne8f8 is the safer choice as it:\n- Moves the king away from the f-file\n- Maintains the option to castle kingside later\n- Doesn't expose the king to potential checks\n\ne8d8 would leave the king more exposed to potential attacks on the d-file.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne8f8\n```"
