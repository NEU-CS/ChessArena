When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, pawns. Black has a knight, pawns, a rook. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on c3. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on e5 and f5. Black has pawns on a5, b5, g7, h6.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on e4 is very active. Rook on h3 is well-placed.\n\n5. Threats: Black's knight on g2 is attacking the rook. White needs to address this.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- e4g2: Capturing the knight with the bishop would solve the immediate threat to the rook.\n- h3g3: Moving the rook to defend the knight.\n- f5f6: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn.\n- e5e6: Pushing the e-pawn.\n- g4g5: Pushing the g-pawn.\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on g2 attacking the rook. If we don't address this, we'll lose the rook.\n\ne4g2 (Bxg2) seems like the most straightforward solution - it wins the knight and removes the threat to the rook. After this move, White will be up a piece.\n\nOther moves like h3g3 (Rg3) would defend the knight but leave it there, which isn't ideal. The pawn pushes are interesting but don't address the immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne4g2\n```"
