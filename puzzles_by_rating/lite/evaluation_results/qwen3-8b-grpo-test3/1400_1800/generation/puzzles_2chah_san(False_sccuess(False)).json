When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+N+Q vs Black's R+B+Q). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on h5 is eyeing the h7 pawn. White's knight on c7 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c6e5: Knight move attacking the queen\n- c6d4: Knight move attacking the rook\n- a1d4: Rook move attacking the knight\n- c8e6: Bishop move developing the piece\n- h7h6: Pawn move giving the king escape squares\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on c7 which is attacking the queen. If we don't address this, White can play Nxe8 winning the queen.\n\nThe best move is c6e5, which:\n- Moves the knight to defend the queen\n- Attacks the queen\n- Opens the c8-h3 diagonal for the bishop\n- Maintains control over d3 and f3 squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
