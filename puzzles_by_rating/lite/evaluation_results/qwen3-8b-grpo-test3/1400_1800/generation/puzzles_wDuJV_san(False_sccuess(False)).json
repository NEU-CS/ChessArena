When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a king, pawns at a2 and f5, a rook at h1, and a knight at g4. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed at c4. Black's king is at f4, also exposed.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White's d-pawn is advanced and supported by the rook. Black's f-pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Immediate threats: Black's rook at h1 is attacking White's rook at g6. White needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f6h6: Moves rook away from attack but doesn't help much\n- f6f7: Moves rook forward but still leaves it attacked\n- f6g6: Captures the pawn but leaves rook under attack\n- b4c5: Moves king towards the center\n- d6d7: Advances the passed pawn\n- c4c5: Moves king towards the center\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the rook. If we don't address it, we'll lose the rook. The best move is to capture the f5 pawn with the rook, which also opens up the f-file for our king to escape.\n\n```\nf6f5\n```"
