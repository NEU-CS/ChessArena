When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+Q+R vs Black's R+Q). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g2, relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on c3 and queen on h3 are well-placed. Black's rook on e8 and queen on f6 are active.\n\n4. Threats: White's rook on f3 is attacking the f6 queen. White's knight on c3 is eyeing the b5 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f6e5: Moves the queen to defend the rook while attacking the knight\n- f6d4: Moves the queen to attack the knight\n- e8e4: Moves the rook to attack the knight\n- g7g6: Creates luft for the king\n- f6h4: Moves the queen to attack the h3 queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the f6 queen. If we don't defend it, White can capture with Rxf6.\n\nThe best move is to move the queen to e5, which:\n- Defends the rook on e8\n- Attacks the knight on c3\n- Maintains control over the f6 square\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6e5\n```"
