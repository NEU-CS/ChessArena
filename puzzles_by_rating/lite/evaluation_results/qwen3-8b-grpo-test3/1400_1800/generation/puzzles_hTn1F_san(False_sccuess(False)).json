When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop, knight, pawns. Black has a bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on f3 is well-placed. Black's bishop on h5 is eyeing the h3 pawn.\n\n4. Threats: Black's knight on c6 is attacking the pawn on d2. White needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d2c3: Protects the pawn and develops the queen\n- d2b4: Attacks the knight\n- f3h5: Captures the bishop\n- c2c6: Captures the knight\n- e3e4: Pawn push to open lines\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on c6 attacking d2. c2c6 (capturing the knight) seems most appealing as it:\n- Removes the knight from c6\n- Opens the c-file for White's rook\n- Maintains control over d2\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- f3h5 leaves the bishop exposed\n- d2b4 doesn't address the knight\n- e3e4 weakens d4\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc2c6\n```"
