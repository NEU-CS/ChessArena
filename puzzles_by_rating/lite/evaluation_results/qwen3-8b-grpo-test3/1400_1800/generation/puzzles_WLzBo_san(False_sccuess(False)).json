When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a passed d-pawn that's advanced to d7.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g3, also exposed.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on f3 is attacking the e3 pawn. White's bishop on e6 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8e7: Rook move to defend the e3 pawn\n- e8e6: Rook move to attack the bishop\n- a3a6: Rook move to defend the a-pawn\n- h6h5: Pawn move to gain space\n- a7a5: Pawn move to open lines for the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the e3 pawn under attack by the rook. If we don't defend it, White could play Rxe3 winning material.\n\ne8e7 seems like the most solid move, defending the e3 pawn while also keeping the rook active. Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
