When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed at d2. Black's king is at h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen at g2 is attacking White's rook at e1. White needs to address this immediately.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d2d1: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address the queen threat\n- d2c1: Moves king towards the corner but still leaves the rook under attack\n- g4e2: Bishop move that doesn't help\n- e1e2: Moves the rook out of the queen's attack while also protecting the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the e1 rook. e1e2:\n- Moves the rook out of the queen's line\n- Protects the king from potential checks\n- Maintains control of the e-file\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nThe other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne1e2\n```"
