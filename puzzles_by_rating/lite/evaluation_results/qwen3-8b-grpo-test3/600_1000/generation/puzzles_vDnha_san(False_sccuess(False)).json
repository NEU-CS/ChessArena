When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+B, Black has R). Materially, White is ahead.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on f7. White's king is on a2, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on b7 is attacking Black's pawn on c5. White's pawn on f4 is advanced and could be dangerous.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e3e1: Rook move attacking the king\n- e3e2: Rook move attacking the pawn\n- e3h3: Rook move towards the kingside\n- f7g8: King move towards the corner\n- f7e7: King move towards the center\n- c6c5: Pawn move defending the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on b7. If it captures the c5 pawn (Nxc5), White will gain material. Therefore, we need to defend the c5 pawn.\n\nThe best move is c6c5, which:\n- Defends the pawn\n- Opens the c-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over the center\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems (like e3e1 which would leave the king exposed).\n\n```\nc6c5\n```"
