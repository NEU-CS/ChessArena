When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+R). Materially, White is ahead.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b2. Black's king is on e5, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on g3 is attacking White's rook on e2. White's knight on b4 is threatening to capture the pawn on c6.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5f6: King moves to capture the pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e5d6: King moves towards the knight\n- e5f4: King moves towards the knight\n- g3g5: Rook move, but doesn't help\n- g3g2: Rook move attacking the pawn\n- g6g5: Pawn move creating space for the king\n- b6b5: Pawn move attacking the knight\n- h5h4: Pawn move creating space\n- f5f4: Pawn move creating space\n- e4e3: Pawn push attacking the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on b4 threatening to capture the c6 pawn. If the knight captures c6, White will have a strong knight on c6. Therefore, we need to address this threat.\n\nThe best move is b6b5, which:\n- Attacks the knight on b4\n- Opens the b-file for Black's rook\n- Creates space for Black's pieces\n- Maintains control over the c6 pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb6b5\n```"
