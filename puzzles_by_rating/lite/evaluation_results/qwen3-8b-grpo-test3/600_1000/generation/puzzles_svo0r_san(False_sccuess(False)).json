When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on f7 is attacking Black's pawn on g7. White's queen on h3 is eyeing the h-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g6h7: Knight move attacking the rook\n- f6h5: Knight move attacking the queen\n- f6d5: Knight move centralizing\n- g5g4: Pawn push creating space\n- a4a3: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on f7 attacking the g7 pawn. If White captures the pawn with Rxf7, Black loses material.\n\nThe best move is to play f6h5, attacking the queen while also protecting the g7 pawn. This:\n- Attacks White's queen\n- Protects the g7 pawn\n- Opens potential lines for Black's pieces\n- Maintains control over the center\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nf6h5\n```"
