When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on c1. Black's king is on a7.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's queen on f4 is very active. Black's queen on g7 is also active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's knight on e5 is well-placed. White's pawn on e4 is advanced.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f4e5: Capturing the knight with the queen\n- e2d4: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- d3c4: Bishop move\n- g3g4: Pawn push\n- c2c4: Pawn push\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e5. If we don't address it, it could cause problems. The move f4e5 (Qxe5) wins the knight and opens up the f-file for White's rook (though there is no rook on the board). It also removes a key defender from the center.\n\nOther moves:\n- e2d4 (Nxd4) would attack the pawn but leave the knight on e5\n- d3c4 (Bc4) is a nice developing move but doesn't address the knight\n- g3g4 is too slow\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the knight with the queen.\n\n```\nf4e5\n```"
