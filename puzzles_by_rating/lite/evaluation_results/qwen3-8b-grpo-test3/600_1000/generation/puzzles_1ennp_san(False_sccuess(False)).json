When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on d4, f3, g2, h2. Black has pawns on a6, c6, d6, h5. The d-pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook is on c1. Black's rook is on b4, attacking the d4 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c1c6: Rook takes pawn, but allows Rb4xd4\n- c1c4: Defends the d4 pawn\n- d4d5: Advances the pawn but leaves it exposed\n- f3f4: Gains space but weakens e3\n- h2h4/g2g4: Pawn advances but don't address immediate concerns\n\nThe most pressing concern is the d4 pawn under attack by the rook. If we don't defend it, Black can play Rb4xd4 winning the pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to defend the d4 pawn with the rook:\n\n```\nc1c4\n```"
