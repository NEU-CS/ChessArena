When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material disadvantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on d6 is attacking Black's rook on e7. White's queen on f3 is eyeing the f7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e7d7: Moves the rook to defend the d-file\n- e7f7: Moves the rook to defend the f7 pawn\n- g5h6: Pawn capture, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e3e2: Pawn push, but doesn't help\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the e7 rook. If we don't defend it, White can capture with Rxd7 or Rfe1.\n\ne7d7 seems most flexible:\n- Defends the rook\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- Doesn't block the e-pawn\n- Maintains control over the 7th rank\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7d7\n```"
