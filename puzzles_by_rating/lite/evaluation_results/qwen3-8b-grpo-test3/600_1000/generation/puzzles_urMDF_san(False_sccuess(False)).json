When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on g4 is attacking the pawn on f2. Black's bishop on h3 is eyeing the knight on g5.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g5h7: Knight move attacking the rook\n- g5f7: Knight move attacking the rook\n- d5e6: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- d2f4: Rook move attacking the queen\n- f2f3: Pawn move protecting the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the queen on g4 attacking f2 and the bishop on h3 attacking the knight. \n\nThe best move is d2f4, attacking the queen while also opening the f-file for White's rook. This move:\n- Attacks the queen\n- Opens the f-file for White's rook\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Maintains control of the center\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nd2f4\n```"
