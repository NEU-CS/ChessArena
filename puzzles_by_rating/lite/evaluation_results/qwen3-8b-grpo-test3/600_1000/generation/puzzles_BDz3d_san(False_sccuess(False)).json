When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+N+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on f3 is eyeing the long diagonal. Black's queen on e5 is well-placed but needs to be careful about attacks.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5f4: Queen move attacking the bishop\n- e5e4: Queen move controlling the center\n- e5g3: Queen move attacking the pawn\n- e5h2: Queen move threatening the h2 pawn\n- e5f6: Queen move attacking the knight\n- g8f6: Knight development\n- e7e6: Pawn move creating space for the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's bishop on f3 which is very active. The move e5f4 (Qf4) addresses this by:\n- Attacking the bishop\n- Opening the f-file for Black's rook\n- Maintaining control over e4\n- Preparing potential queenside castling\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5f4\n```"
