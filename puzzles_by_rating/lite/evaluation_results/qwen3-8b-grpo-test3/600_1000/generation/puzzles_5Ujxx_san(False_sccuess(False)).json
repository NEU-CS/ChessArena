When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's Q+B+P). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on e8 with some protection.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on e4 is attacking Black's pawn on d5. White's queen on e2 is eyeing the e-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f5e4: Capturing the knight with the bishop seems most pressing - it wins the knight and opens the f-file for Black's rook\n- e8g8: Castling kingside would improve king safety\n- e7h4: Queen move attacking the h-pawn\n- d5e4: Pawn capture of the knight\n- e8f7: King move protecting the f7 pawn\n\nThe most forcing move is d5e4 (pawn takes knight), which:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e4\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat (White's knight) or create new problems (like e8g8 which leaves the king exposed to checks).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5e4\n```"
