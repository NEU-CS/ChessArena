When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed at h2. Black's king is at g7.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook at g3 is attacking Black's queen at e5. White's queen at d8 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7f7: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g7h6: Moves king towards the corner but also doesn't help\n- e5g5: Moves queen to defend the rook while attacking the g3 rook\n- e5g3: Captures the rook with the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the e5 queen. If we don't address this, White can win the queen.\n\nBetween e5g5 and e5g3, e5g3 is clearly better because:\n- It wins the rook\n- After capturing, White's queen at d8 is still a threat but we can deal with it\n- e5g5 would just move the queen to a less active position while still losing the queen to Rg3xe5\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the rook with the queen.\n\n```\ne5g3\n```"
