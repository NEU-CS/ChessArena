When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on h7.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on e3 is attacking the pawn on f3. White's knight on e4 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4f6: Knight move attacking the pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threat to f3\n- e4d6: Knight move, but doesn't help\n- e4c5: Knight move, but doesn't help\n- e4g3: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- e4c3: Knight move\n- e4f2: Knight move\n- e4d2: Knight move\n- g2h3: King move away from potential checks\n- g2g3: King move\n- g2h2: King move\n- g2f1: King move\n- f3f4: Pawn push creating space for the knight and protecting f3\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on e3 attacking f3. If we don't address this, Black could play Bxf2 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is f3f4, which:\n- Protects the f3 pawn from the bishop\n- Creates space for the knight on e4\n- Opens a line for the rook on h6 to potentially attack the king\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf3f4\n```"
