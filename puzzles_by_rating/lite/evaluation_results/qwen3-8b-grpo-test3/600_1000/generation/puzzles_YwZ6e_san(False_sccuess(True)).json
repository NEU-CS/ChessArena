White's queen on d4 is under attack by Black's pawn on e4.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f2g3: Captures the knight with the pawn. This removes the immediate threat to f2 and opens the f-file for White's rook.\n- f1g1: Moves the king towards safety but doesn't address the knight threat.\n\nThe more pressing concern is the knight on g3. If we don't capture it, it could cause problems later. After f2g3, White would have:\n- Removed the knight\n- Opened the f-file for the rook\n- Maintained control over d4\n\nf1g1 doesn't solve any immediate problems and leaves the king exposed.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the knight with f2g3.\n\n```\nf2g3\n```"
