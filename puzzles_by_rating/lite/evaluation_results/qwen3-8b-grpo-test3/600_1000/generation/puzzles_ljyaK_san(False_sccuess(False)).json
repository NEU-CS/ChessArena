When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns. Black has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is at e7, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's queen at a8 is very active. Black's knight at g8 and rook at h8 are also active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's bishop at g4 is eyeing the h2 pawn. White's pawn at d4 is under attack by the black bishop at e4.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- a8e4: Capturing the bishop with the queen\n- g2e4: Capturing the bishop with the knight\n- g1e2: Developing the knight\n- b1c3: Developing the knight\n- c4c5: Pawn push\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop at e4 attacking the d4 pawn. Both a8e4 and g2e4 capture the bishop, but g2e4 (knight capture) seems better because:\n1. It develops the knight\n2. It maintains the queen's active position\n3. It doesn't leave the queen exposed to potential attacks\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng2e4\n```"
