When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a Rook and pawns. Black has a Rook, Bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h5. Black's king is on g5, also exposed.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a2, b3, c4, g2, h2. Black has pawns on a5, b6, c5, d5, h4. The c4 pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's Rook on h7 is very active. Black's Rook on e8 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- h7h8: Rook promotion threat, but Black can play Re8xh8\n- h7g7: Attacks the g7 pawn, but doesn't seem to gain much\n- h7f7: Moves Rook to f-file\n- h7e7: Moves Rook to e-file\n- h7d7: Moves Rook to d-file\n- h7c7: Moves Rook to c-file\n- h7b7: Moves Rook to b-file\n- h7a7: Moves Rook to a-file\n- h7h6: Moves Rook back\n- h5h6: King move, but exposes to checks\n- b3b4: Pawn push, gains space\n- g2g3/g2g4: Pawn pushes, but don't seem urgent\n\nThe most promising move is b3b4. This:\n- Gains space on the queenside\n- Opens the b-file for White's Rook\n- Prepares potential b4-c5 pawn break\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb3b4\n```"
