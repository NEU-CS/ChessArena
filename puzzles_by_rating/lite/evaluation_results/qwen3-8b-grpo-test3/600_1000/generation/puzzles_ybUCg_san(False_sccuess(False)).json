When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g3. Black's king is on h5, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a4, c4, e4, g4. Black has pawns on a6, b6, c5, d5. The e4 pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on f1 is inactive. Black's knight on f6 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f6g8: Knight move attacking the rook\n- f6e8: Knight move\n- f6h7: Knight move\n- f6d7: Knight move\n- f6h5: Knight move\n- f6d5: Knight move\n- f6g4: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- f6e4: Knight move capturing the pawn\n- g5h6: King move\n- b6b5: Pawn move\n- a6a5: Pawn move\n\nThe most promising moves are f6e4 (capturing the pawn) and f6g4 (attacking the pawn). \n\nf6e4 seems most appealing because:\n1. It wins a pawn\n2. Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n3. Maintains control over d2\n4. Doesn't expose the knight to attacks\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6e4\n```"
