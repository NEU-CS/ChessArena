When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has R+N+P, Black has R+N+P+P). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f2. Black's king is on d6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on d4 and f4. Black has pawns on b6, c5, d5, g3. The g3 pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on h4 is well-placed. Black's knight on e7 and rook on f7 are active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e7g6: Knight move attacking the h4 knight\n- e7f5: Knight move centralizing\n- d6e6: King move towards the center\n- b6b5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on h4 which is eyeing the g6 square. If we don't address this, White could play Nf6 or Ng6.\n\ne7g6 seems most promising as it:\n- Attacks the h4 knight\n- Opens the e7-knight's eye on f4\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7g6\n```"
