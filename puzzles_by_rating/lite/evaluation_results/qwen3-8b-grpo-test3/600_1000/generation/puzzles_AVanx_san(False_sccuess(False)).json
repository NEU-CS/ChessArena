When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, pawns. Black has a rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on e5 is very active. Black's knight on g4 is also active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's queen on h5 is eyeing the h2 pawn. White's knight on e5 is close to Black's king.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e5f7: Knight takes pawn, but doesn't seem to lead to anything immediate\n- e5d7: Knight move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- e5g6: Knight move, but doesn't seem to help\n- e5c6: Knight move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- e5g4: Knight takes knight - this seems most promising as it wins the knight\n- Other moves don't seem to address the immediate threats or improve White's position\n\nThe most forcing move is e5g4, capturing the knight on g4. This:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the g-file for White's rook\n- Doesn't expose White's king further\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or leave the knight on e5 vulnerable. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5g4\n```"
