When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+B+Q). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on g3 is well-placed. Black's bishop on g4 is very active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's bishop on g4 is eyeing the h3 pawn. White's queen on e2 is protecting it.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g4h5: Bishop move attacking the h5 pawn\n- g4f5: Bishop move centralizing\n- f6e5: Knight move attacking the d3 pawn\n- c7e5: Queen move attacking the e5 pawn\n- d5d4: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on g3 which is very active. The move f6e5 (Nxe5) would:\n- Attack the d3 pawn\n- Open the e5 square for Black's knight\n- Potentially lead to exchanges that could simplify the position\n\nOther moves like g4f5 or c7e5 are also reasonable, but f6e5 seems most flexible and useful.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6e5\n```"
