When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+N+R+R vs Black's R+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on d6 is very active. Black's rook on e5 is under attack by the knight.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5e8: Rook lift, but doesn't address the knight\n- e5e7: Protects the pawn but doesn't help\n- b5e2: Bishop move attacking the rook\n- b5d7: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- f7f5: Pawn push creating space\n- g6g5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on d6. If we don't address it, White can play Nxc8 or Nf5 with strong threats.\n\nThe best move is b5d7, attacking the knight while also opening lines for Black's pieces. This forces White to respond to the threat to the knight rather than continuing development.\n\n```\nb5d7\n```"
