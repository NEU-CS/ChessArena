When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+B+R+P+P+P+P vs Black's N+R+P+P+P+Q). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on e5 is very active. Black's queen on c6 is under attack by the bishop.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c6e8: Queen takes rook - but White's rook isn't on e8\n- c6d7: Queen moves to defend the bishop\n- f5g6: Bishop move - but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c6e6: Queen move - but still leaves the queen exposed\n- f5e6: Bishop takes pawn - but opens lines for White's pieces\n\nThe most pressing concern is the safety of Black's queen on c6. Several moves address this:\n\n1. c6d7 - Moves the queen to defend the bishop on e5\n2. c6e8 - Moves the queen to a safer square\n3. f5e6 - Captures the pawn and opens the bishop's diagonal\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to capture the pawn with the bishop, opening lines for Black's pieces while also removing a pawn from White's structure.\n\n```\nf5e6\n```"
