When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's R+N+P). White has a bishop on e6 that's very active.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is on c6, which is exposed.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on e6 is attacking the knight on e7. White's pawn on e4 is advanced and supported by the bishop.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c6d6: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- c6b6: Moves king towards the queenside but still leaves the knight vulnerable\n- c6b5: Moves king towards the pawn but doesn't help\n- d8d5: Queen move that attacks the knight and opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- e7d5: Knight takes pawn, removing the e4 pawn's support and opening the e-file for Black's rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on e7 being attacked by the bishop. If we don't address this, White can play Bxd7 winning the rook.\n\ne7d5 seems best because:\n1. It captures the pawn\n2. It opens the e-file for Black's rook\n3. It removes the e4 pawn's support\n4. After this move, if White takes the knight with Bxd7, Black can play Rhd8 winning the rook\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7d5\n```"
