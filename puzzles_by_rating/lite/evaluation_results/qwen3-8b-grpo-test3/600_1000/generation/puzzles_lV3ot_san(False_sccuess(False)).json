When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight; Black has Rook, Bishop). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e3. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on g6 and c4. Black has pawns on d7, e6, g6.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on b6 is very active. Black's rook on a2 is passive.\n\n5. Threats: White's rook on b6 is attacking the bishop on c6. Black needs to address this.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- The most pressing concern is the rook on b6 attacking the bishop on c6. Several moves address this:\n  - c6b7 - moves the bishop to safety\n  - c6d5 - moves the bishop to safety\n  - c6e4 - moves the bishop to safety\n  - a2a6 - rook move that also attacks the rook\n\nThe best move is a2a6, which:\n- Moves the rook to a more active position\n- Attacks the white rook on b6\n- Opens the a-file for black's rook\n- Maintains pressure on the a-pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or leave pieces passive. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na2a6\n```"
