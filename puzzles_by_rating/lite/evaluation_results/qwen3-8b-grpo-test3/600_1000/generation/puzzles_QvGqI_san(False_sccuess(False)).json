When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+N+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (g8).\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on d4 is attacking the pawn on c4. White's knight on f3 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d6e5: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- d6f4: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- d6g3: Bishop move attacking the knight\n- g4h5: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- f7f5: Pawn move creating space\n- e6e5: Pawn move opening lines\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on d4 attacking the c4 pawn. If White captures the pawn with Qxc4, White will be up a pawn and Black's position will be weakened.\n\nThe best move is to play d6f4, attacking the queen while also developing the bishop to a more active square. This forces White to move the queen or lose the c4 pawn.\n\n```\nd6f4\n```"
