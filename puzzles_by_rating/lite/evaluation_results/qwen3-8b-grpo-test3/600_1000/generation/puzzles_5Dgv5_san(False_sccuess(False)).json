When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e2. Black's king is on c8.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on g5 is attacking the knight on e5. White's knight on c3 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5g6: Moves the knight to safety while attacking the bishop\n- e5f3: Moves the knight towards White's king\n- h6g5: Captures the bishop\n- g7g6: Pushes the pawn to kick the bishop\n- Other moves don't seem to address immediate concerns\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on g5 attacking the knight. If we don't address this, White can play Bxe7 or Bf4.\n\nh6g5 (capturing the bishop) seems most appealing as it:\n- Removes the attacking piece\n- Opens the h-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e5\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther options:\n- e5g6 allows Bxe7\n- e5f3 doesn't address the immediate threat\n- g7g6 allows Bf4\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh6g5\n```"
