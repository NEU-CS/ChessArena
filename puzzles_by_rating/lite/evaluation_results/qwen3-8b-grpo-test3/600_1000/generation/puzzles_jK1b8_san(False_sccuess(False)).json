When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is up a bishop and pawn (Bishop + pawn vs nothing). White has a queen and pawn.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has an advanced pawn on a6. Black has pawns on c5, e4, f7, g7, h6.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's queen on b6 is very active. White's queen on a4 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b6d8: Queen takes rook (but there's no rook on d8)\n- b6c7: Queen move, but doesn't accomplish much\n- b6g6: Queen move, attacking the h-pawn\n- b6f6: Queen move, centralizing\n- b6e6: Queen move, centralizing\n- b6d6: Queen move, centralizing\n- b6c6: Queen move, protecting the c5 pawn\n- b6a6: Queen takes pawn on a6\n- g7g6: Pawn move, creating space for the king\n- f7f6: Pawn move, creating space for the king\n- h6h5: Pawn move, creating space for the king\n- c5c4: Pawn push, gaining space\n- e4e3: Pawn push, gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the pawn on a6. If White captures it with axb7, White will promote a pawn. Therefore, we need to capture the a6 pawn immediately.\n\nThe best move is to capture the a6 pawn with the queen:\n\n```\nb6a6\n```"
