When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's queen on g8 is attacking the rook on f8.\n\n3. Immediate threats: White's queen on g8 is attacking the rook on f8. If the rook moves, White can play Qxg7 winning the pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves: Only legal move is f8g8 (Rook takes queen).\n\nThis is forced - if Black doesn't take the queen, White will capture the rook next move. After f8g8, the position would be:\n\n- Material would be roughly equal (White would have R+N vs Black's R)\n- White's knight on h6 is still a threat\n- Black's knight on b3 is attacking the pawn on c2\n\nWhile the position would still be difficult for Black, taking the queen is the only reasonable move. Any other move would lose the rook immediately.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf8g8\n```"
