After a8d8:\n\n- Material will be roughly equal (White loses queen, Black loses rook)\n- White's knight and pawns remain strong\n- Black's queen on e5 is well-placed\n- Black's pawns on the queenside are advanced\n\nWhile the position remains difficult for Black, taking the queen is the only reasonable move. Any other move would lose the rook immediately.\n\n```\na8d8\n```"
