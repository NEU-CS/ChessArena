When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a passed pawn on d4 that's advanced.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on a2. Black's king is on b8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on g3 is attacking the g2 pawn. White's rook on f7 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g3g2: Capturing the pawn with the queen\n- h1e4: Rook move attacking the e4 pawn\n- d8d4: Rook move capturing the pawn\n- g3e5: Queen move attacking the e4 pawn\n- b7b5: Pawn move creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the g2 pawn. If White plays Kc2, the king will be very exposed. Taking the g2 pawn with g3g2 seems most urgent as it:\n- Wins material\n- Opens the g-file for Black's rook\n- Creates threats against White's king\n\nOther moves don't address the immediate threats. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3g2\n```"
