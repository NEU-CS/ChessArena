When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g5. Black's king is on d5, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on f2, g2, h3. Black has pawns on e4, h4, and a passed pawn on h5.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's Rook on h8 is very active. Black's knight on f6 is well-placed.\n\n5. Threats: Black's knight on f6 is eyeing the g4 pawn. White's rook is attacking the h-file pawns.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- Rook moves: Most rook moves maintain pressure or move to different files\n- g5h6: King move that doesn't seem to help\n- g5g6: King move that could be dangerous\n- g5h4: King move that might be too exposed\n- h3h4: Pawn move that could open lines for the rook\n- g2g3/f2f3/g2g4/f2f4: Pawn moves that don't seem immediately helpful\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be the rook moves, particularly h8h5 which would:\n- Attack the h5 pawn\n- Open the h-file for the rook\n- Potentially prepare h8h4 to attack the h4 pawn\n\nOther rook moves like h8e8 or h8d8 would move the rook to different files but maintain pressure.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to play h8h5, attacking the h5 pawn and opening the h-file for the rook.\n\n```\nh8h5\n```"
