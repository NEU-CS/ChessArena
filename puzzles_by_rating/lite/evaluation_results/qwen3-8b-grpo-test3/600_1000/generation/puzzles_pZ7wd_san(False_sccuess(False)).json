When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+Q+B, Black has Q+B). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on c8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on d5 is very active. Black's queen on g6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on d5 is attacking Black's pawn on e7. White's queen on d3 is eyeing the d-file.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f5e4: Capturing the knight with the pawn would win the knight\n- g6e8: Queen move attacking the rook\n- f5f4: Pawn push gaining space\n- b7d5: Bishop capture of the knight\n- Other moves don't seem as promising\n\nThe most forcing move is b7d5, capturing the knight with the bishop. This:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the diagonal for Black's light-squared bishop\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new problems (like f5e4 would open the f-file for White's rook).\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb7d5\n```"
