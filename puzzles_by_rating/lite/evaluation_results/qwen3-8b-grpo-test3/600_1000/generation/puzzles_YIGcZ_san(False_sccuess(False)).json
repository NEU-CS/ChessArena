When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on g2 is attacking White's pawn on h2. White's knight on e7 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g8f8: Moves king towards the center but still leaves the h2 pawn vulnerable\n- g8h7: Moves king towards the h-pawn while also protecting the g2 queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the h2 pawn which is under attack by the queen. If White captures the pawn with Kxg2, Black can play ...Qxh1 winning the rook. Therefore, we need to protect the queen while also addressing the h2 pawn threat.\n\ng8h7 seems the best move as it:\n- Protects the g2 queen\n- Moves the king closer to the h-pawn\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nThe other moves leave the queen exposed or don't address the h2 pawn threat.\n\n```\ng8h7\n```"
