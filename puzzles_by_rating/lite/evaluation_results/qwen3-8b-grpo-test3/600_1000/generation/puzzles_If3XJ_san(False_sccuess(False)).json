When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on d2. Black's king is on d4, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on e3, f2, g2. Black has pawns on a7, d3, e5, h4. The e-pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on h6 is very active. Black's rook on b7 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- h6h8: Rook lift, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- h6g6: Attacks the g6 pawn\n- h6f6: Moves towards the center\n- h6e6: Moves towards the center\n- h6d6: Moves towards the center\n- h6c6: Moves towards the center\n- h6h5: Moves down the h-file\n- d2e1/d2d1/d2c1: King moves to safety\n- f2f3/f2f4: Pawn moves\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. Black's rook on b7 is eyeing the b-file towards White's king. Therefore, moving the king to safety should be the priority.\n\nAmong the king moves, d2c1 seems best as it:\n- Moves the king away from the center\n- Doesn't block the rook on h6\n- Maintains flexibility\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd2c1\n```"
