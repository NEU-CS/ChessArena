When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g6, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on h3 is attacking the h2 pawn. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h2g3: Moves the pawn to block the queen's attack on h2 while opening a line for the white rook on f1\n- f2g3: Moves the pawn to block the queen's attack on h2 while protecting the f2 pawn\n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- f2g3 is the better move because:\n  - It blocks the queen's attack on h2\n  - It protects the f2 pawn\n  - It opens a potential path for the white knight on g6\n  - It doesn't weaken the h2 pawn like h2g3 would\n\nThe move f2g3 addresses the immediate threat while improving White's position. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf2g3\n```"
