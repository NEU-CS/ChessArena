When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on b3. Black's king is on a5, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on b5 and c4. Black has pawns on d5, g6, h6. The b5 pawn is advanced and could be dangerous.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop is well-placed on e2. Black's knight on f4 is active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b5b6: Advances the passed pawn, but allows ...Nxd3\n- e2f3: Attacks the knight, but allows ...Nxd3\n- e2d3: Captures the knight, but allows ...Bxh3\n- g4g5: Advances pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f4f5: Advances pawn, but doesn't help\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on f4 attacking the pawn on e2. If we don't address this, the knight could capture our pawn or move to a better square.\n\nThe best move is e2d3, capturing the knight. While it allows Bxh3, we can defend that pawn with h3h4 later. The knight capture is more pressing.\n\n```\ne2d3\n```"
