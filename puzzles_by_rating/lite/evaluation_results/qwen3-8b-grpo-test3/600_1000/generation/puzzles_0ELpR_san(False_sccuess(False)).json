When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop, pawns. Black has a bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's rook on e4 is well-placed. Black's knight on g4 is very active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's knight on g4 is attacking White's pawn on f3. White needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f3g4: Capturing the knight with the bishop\n- e4g4: Capturing the knight with the rook\n- f3f5: Moving the bishop to safety\n- d1d4: Moving the rook to defend e4\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on g4 attacking f3. Both f3g4 and e4g4 capture the knight, but e4g4 (rook takes knight) is better because:\n1. It maintains the bishop's protection of f3\n2. The rook on g4 is more active than the bishop\n3. It opens the e4-g4 diagonal for White's bishop\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne4g4\n```"
