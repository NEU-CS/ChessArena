When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a king and two pawns (d3, g3). Black has a king, a pawn (g4), and a knight (f5). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is well-placed in the center (d5). Black's king is near the pawns (e5).\n\n3. Pawn structure: White's pawns are d3 and g3. Black has a passed pawn on g4 that could be dangerous if it advances.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d5d6: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d5c6: Moves king towards the queenside but away from the g-pawn\n- d5c5: Keeps king centralized while moving towards the g-pawn\n- d5c4: Moves king towards the d-pawn but away from the g-pawn\n- d3d4: Advances the d-pawn which could be useful for creating a passed pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the g4 pawn which could promote if not addressed. The move d5c5:\n- Moves the king closer to the g-pawn\n- Maintains central control\n- Doesn't abandon the d-pawn\n- Prepares potential support for the g3 pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the g-pawn threat or move the king away from important areas. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5c5\n```"
