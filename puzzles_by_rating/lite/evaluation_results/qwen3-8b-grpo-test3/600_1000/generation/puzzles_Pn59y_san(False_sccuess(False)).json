When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on e7 is very active. Black's rook on f8 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's queen on g4 is attacking the pawn on g6. Black's queen on a5 is eyeing the a-pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e7g8: Knight move attacking the rook\n- e7c8: Knight move\n- g4g7: Queen move attacking the pawn\n- g4d7: Queen move\n- f4f5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. The move g1f2 (king move) would address this by moving the king towards safety while also opening a line for the white bishop.\n\nHowever, looking at the legal moves list, I don't see g1f2 listed. The closest option is g1h1 or g1f1 which don't help. Therefore, we need to focus on other aspects.\n\nThe most active move is e7g8, moving the knight to attack the black rook. This also opens up possibilities for the white queen to attack the g6 pawn.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7g8\n```"
