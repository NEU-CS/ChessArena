When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and two pawns. Black has a knight, bishop, pawns, and a king. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f5. Black's king is on d7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a5, b3, h3. Black has pawns on b6, f4. The a-pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on b4 is well-placed. Black's knight on e7 is passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f5f6: Advances king but doesn't accomplish much\n- f5g5: Moves king towards the pawns\n- f5e5: Moves king towards the center\n- f5g4: Attacks the f4 pawn\n- f5f4: Captures the f4 pawn\n- f5e4: Moves king towards the queenside\n- b4e7: Bishop takes knight\n\nThe most promising move is b4e7, capturing the knight. This:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the e7 square for White's king to move towards\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb4e7\n```"
