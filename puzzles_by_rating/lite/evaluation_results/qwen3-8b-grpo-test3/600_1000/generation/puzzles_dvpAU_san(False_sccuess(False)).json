When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a knight (White has R+B+R vs Black's N+Q). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on b7 is attacking Black's queen on d7. White's queen on g4 is eyeing the g6 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d7e7: Moves the queen to defend the rook on b7\n- g8f6: Develops the knight to a active square\n- c5e3: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- f7f6: Pawn move creating space for the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the queen. If we don't defend it, White can win the queen with Rxb7.\n\nd7e7 seems like the most forcing move - it defends the rook while also opening lines for Black's pieces. After this move:\n- If White takes the queen with Rxb7, Black can play Nf6 attacking the rook\n- If White moves the rook, Black can consider developing pieces\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd7e7\n```"
