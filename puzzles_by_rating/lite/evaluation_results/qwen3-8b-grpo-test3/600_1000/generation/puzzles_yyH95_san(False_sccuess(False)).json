When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a pawn (White has Rook, Rook, Bishop; Black has Rook, Rook, Bishop). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on h3 is eyeing the h-file. Black's rook on e8 is under attack by White's rook on b7.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g7g8: King moves to g8, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g7f8: King moves to f8, but still leaves the rook under attack\n- g7g6: King moves towards the center\n- e8e7: Rook moves to e7, defending against the rook on b7\n- e6e7: Pawn takes rook on e7\n- e5c7: Queen takes rook on c7\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on e8 being attacked by White's rook on b7. If we don't address this, White can capture the rook.\n\ne6e7 (pawn takes rook) seems most appealing because:\n1. It wins the rook\n2. After exe7, White's rook on b7 is no longer attacking anything\n3. It opens the e-file for Black's rook\n4. It maintains material equality\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6e7\n```"
