When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's bishop on g2 is attacking White's pawn on f2. White's rook on e1 is under attack by Black's queen on e6.\n\n4. Legal moves: Only g1h1 or g1f1 available - both king moves.\n\nEvaluation:\n- g1h1 would move the king towards the corner, but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- g1f1 would move the king towards the center while getting away from the h-file where Black's rook is positioned\n- The main concern is protecting the king while maintaining control of the e-file where White's rook is located\n\nThe better move is g1f1 because:\n1. It moves the king towards the center\n2. It gets away from the h-file\n3. It maintains control of the e-file\n4. It doesn't leave the king in a more exposed position\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"
