When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a rook and bishop for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, pawns; Black has Rook, pawns). Materially, White is ahead.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on b6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on b4, e4, g2. Black has pawns on a7, b5, e5, g6. The e-pawns are blocked.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on c7 is very active. Black's rook on g8 is passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g6g2: Capturing the pawn with the rook, but White's rook on c7 is too active\n- g6e6: Moving the rook to open file\n- g6d6: Same as above\n- g6c6: Same as above\n- b6a6: Moving the king towards the queenside\n- a7a5: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on c7, which is very active. Black needs to either:\n1) Defend against threats to the king\n2) Activate his own pieces\n3) Create counterplay\n\nThe best move is to play g6c6, moving the rook to defend the c-file and prepare potential counterplay against White's rook. This also keeps options open for the king to move to a6 if needed.\n\n```\ng6c6\n```"
