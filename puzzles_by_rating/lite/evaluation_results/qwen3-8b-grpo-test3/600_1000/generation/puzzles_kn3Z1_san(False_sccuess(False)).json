When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is at h7, White's king at f7. Both kings are active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: Black's pawns are at a6 and b7. White has pawns at g2 and a3. The a-pawns are blocked.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook at c4 is very active. Black's rook at a5 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- h7h8: King move to h8 - doesn't seem helpful\n- h7h6: King move to h6 - could be useful to support the pawns\n- a5h5: Rook move to h5 - attacks the h-pawn\n- a5g5: Rook move to g5 - attacks the g-pawn\n- a5f5: Rook move to f5 - centralizes\n- a5e5: Rook move to e5 - centralizes\n- a5d5: Rook move to d5 - centralizes\n- a5c5: Rook move to c5 - attacks the rook\n- a5b5: Rook move to b5 - attacks the b-pawn\n- a5a4: Rook move to a4 - attacks the a-pawn\n- a5a3: Rook move to a3 - captures the pawn!\n- a5a2: Rook move to a2 - doesn't seem helpful\n- a5a1: Rook move to a1 - doesn't seem helpful\n- b7b6: Pawn move - doesn't seem helpful\n- b7b5: Pawn move - opens lines for the rook\n\nThe most forcing move is a5a3, capturing the pawn. This:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Opens the a-file for Black's rook\n- Threatens to capture the a3 pawn\n- Doesn't allow White any counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na5a3\n```"
