When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on f5 is very active. White's queen on g4 is eyeing the g7 pawn. Black's bishop on c7 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b6e3: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- c7e5: Bishop move centralizing\n- b6d4: Knight move centralizing\n- f7f6: Pawn move protecting e5 square\n- g7g6: Pawn move creating luft for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on f5 which is very strong. The knight on e3 would:\n- Attack the bishop on c7\n- Prepare potential knight jumps to d5 or f5\n- Help defend the king\n\nOther moves:\n- c7e5 would centralize the bishop but doesn't address the knight\n- f7f6 would help defend e5 but weakens the pawn structure\n- g7g6 would create luft but doesn't address immediate threats\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play b6e3, improving the knight's position while attacking the bishop.\n\n```\nb6e3\n```"
