When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on c2. Black's king is on g7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on d6 is very active. Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by its own pawn on d7.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on d6 is attacking the queen on e7. White's queen on d3 is eyeing the d-file.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e7f6: Moves the queen to safety while attacking the knight\n- d7f6: Moves the knight to defend the queen\n- h6g5: Moves the bishop to attack the knight\n- f7f5: Opens the f-file for Black's rook\n- g6g5: Gains space on the kingside\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on d6 attacking the queen. Both e7f6 and d7f6 address this. e7f6 also opens the e-file for Black's rook.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is to move the queen to f6, where it's safer and still attacks the knight.\n\n```\ne7f6\n```"
