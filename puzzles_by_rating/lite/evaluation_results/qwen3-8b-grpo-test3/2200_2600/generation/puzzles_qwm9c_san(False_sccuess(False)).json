When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety:\n- White king is exposed on d1\n- Black king is on c7, relatively safe\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White has pawns on a5, c6, h3\n- Black has pawns on a1, d3, g5\n- The c6 pawn is advanced and potentially dangerous\n\n4. Piece activity:\n- White bishop on f6 is very active\n- Black bishop on g5 is also active\n- White rook on a6 is well placed\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d1d2: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f6a1: Captures the rook on a1 with the bishop\n\nThe move f6a1 stands out because:\n- It wins the rook on a1\n- After capturing, the bishop controls the a1-h8 diagonal\n- It opens the a-file for White's rook\n- It doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nd1d2 is too passive and doesn't improve White's position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6a1\n```"
