When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's R+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g4. White's king is still in the center.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on d5 is attacking the pawn on e5. White's bishop on d3 is eyeing the long diagonal.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g4h5: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g4g5: Moves king forward but still leaves it exposed\n- g4h4: Moves king towards the h-file where it might be safer\n- g4f4: Moves king towards the center but closer to White's pieces\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on d5. If it captures the e5 pawn (Qxe5), White will have a strong passed pawn and Black's position will collapse.\n\nNone of the legal moves fully address this threat, but g4f4 seems the most reasonable as it:\n- Moves the king towards the center\n- Maintains some flexibility\n- Doesn't immediately walk into any new threats\n\nThe other moves either leave the king too exposed or don't improve the position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng4f4\n```"
