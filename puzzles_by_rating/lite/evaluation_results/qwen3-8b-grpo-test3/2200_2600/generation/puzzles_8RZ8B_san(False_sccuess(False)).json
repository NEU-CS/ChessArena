When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns. Black has a rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, b4, f3. Black has pawns on a6, b5, e6, h6. The e-pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's rook on d1 is well-placed. Black's rook on e6 is active.\n\n5. Threats: Black's rook on e6 is eyeing the e-file. White needs to address this.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- Rook moves: Most rook moves don't address the immediate threats. d1e1 would defend the e-file but doesn't help much otherwise.\n\n- Pawn moves:\n  - f3f4: Advances the pawn, gains space, and opens the f-file for the rook\n  - a3a4: Advances the pawn but doesn't help much\n  - g2g3/g2g4: These moves would expose the king further\n\nThe best move is f3f4 because:\n1. It gains space in the center\n2. It opens the f-file for White's rook\n3. It prepares potential f4-f5 pushes\n4. It doesn't create new weaknesses\n5. It maintains control over e4\n\nOther moves either don't help or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf3f4\n```"
