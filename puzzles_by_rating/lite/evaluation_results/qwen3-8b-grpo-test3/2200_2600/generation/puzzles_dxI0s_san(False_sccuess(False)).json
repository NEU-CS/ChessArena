When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is at b5, Black's king at c7. Both kings are active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White has passed pawns at d5 and g3/h3\n   - Black has passed pawns at d4 and g4/h4\n   - The c6 pawn is isolated\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - b7b8q: Promoting the bishop to queen seems most forcing\n   - b5a6: Moving king towards the a-pawn\n   - b5c5: Moving king towards the center\n   - d5d6: Pushing the passed pawn\n   - g3f4: Pawn capture\n\nThe most critical move is b7b8q (promoting the bishop to a queen). Here's why:\n1. It creates an immediate threat of a new queen on the board\n2. It opens lines for White's king to attack Black's pawns\n3. It maintains control over the b-file\n4. Other moves either don't improve the position or create weaknesses\n\nAfter b7b8q, White will have a queen and bishop vs. Black's bishop, with active king positions. The promoted queen can support the d-pawn's advance while also attacking Black's pawns.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb7b8q\n```"
