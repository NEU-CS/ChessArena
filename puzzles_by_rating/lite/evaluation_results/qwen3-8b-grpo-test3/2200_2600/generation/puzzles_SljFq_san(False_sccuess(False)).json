When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a passed pawn on d6 that's very advanced.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b4. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on b5 is attacking the pawn on e6. White's pawn on g3 is close to promoting.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h2h4: Attacks the g3 pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- h2e2: Moves the rook to defend the e6 pawn\n- e6e5: Pushes the pawn to protect the bishop and open lines for the rook\n- g7g5: Creates space for the king and opens lines for the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the d6 pawn which is very close to promotion. If it promotes, White will have two queens. Therefore, we need to address this threat immediately.\n\nThe best move is e6e5, which:\n- Protects the bishop on b5\n- Opens the e-file for the rook to defend against the d-pawn's promotion\n- Maintains control over the e6 pawn\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, the correct move is:\n\n```\ne6e5\n```"
