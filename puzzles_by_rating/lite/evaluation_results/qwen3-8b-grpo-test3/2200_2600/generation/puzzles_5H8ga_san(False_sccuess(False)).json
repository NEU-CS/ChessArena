When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on h1.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on d5 is very active. Black's bishop on g4 is attacking the pawn on g3.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g8f8: Moves king towards the center but still leaves it exposed\n- g8g7: Moves king towards the pawns but doesn't help\n- d7f7: Queen move attacking the pawn\n- d7e6: Queen move attacking the bishop\n- g4e6: Bishop capture of the bishop\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on d5. If it remains there, White can play Bxg6 or Bf4 with strong threats. The move d7e6 (Qe6) attacks the bishop while also opening the d-file for Black's rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd7e6\n```"
