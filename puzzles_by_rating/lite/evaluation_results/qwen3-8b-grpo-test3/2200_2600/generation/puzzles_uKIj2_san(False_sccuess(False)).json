When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is also in the center (g1).\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on g5 is very active. Black's knight on d5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on d4 is attacking Black's pawn on e6. White's bishop on g5 is eyeing the h6 pawn.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e8g8 (O-O): Castles kingside to safety\n- e8d8: Castles queenside\n- b8d7: Develops the knight\n- d5f6: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- g7f6: Pawn move attacking the knight\n- a4d7: Queen move attacking the knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is king safety and development. Castling kingside (e8g8) seems most appealing as:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Connects the rooks\n- Opens the h8-rook to potentially attack the h-pawn\n- Maintains control over e4 square\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- e8d8 would leave the king exposed to potential attacks\n- b8d7 doesn't address immediate concerns\n- d5f6 would expose the knight to attacks\n- g7f6 weakens the pawn structure\n\nTherefore, the best move is to castle kingside.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
