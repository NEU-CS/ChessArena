When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on b5. Black's king is on d6, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on d5, e4, h4. Black has pawns on b6, g5, h6. The d5 pawn is isolated and vulnerable.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's rook on c8 is well-placed. The bishop on e7 is controlling important squares.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c8e8: Rook move to open file\n- e7d8: Bishop move to protect the rook\n- d6e5: King move to support the pawns\n- h6h5: Pawn push to gain space\n- f6f5: Pawn push to open lines\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's pawn on d5, which is isolated and could be a target. The move d6e5 (king move) would:\n- Support the d5 pawn\n- Open lines for Black's pieces\n- Maintain control over the center\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd6e5\n```"
