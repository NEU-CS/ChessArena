When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is still in the center (e8). White's king is exposed on g3.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on e4 is attacking the d4 bishop. White's rook on d1 is eyeing the d-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8g8 (castling kingside) - Gets the king to safety and connects rooks\n- e8d8 (castling queenside) - Also gets king to safety\n- b8d7 (developing the knight)\n- d4e5 (moving the bishop to safety)\n- c3e1 (queen takes rook)\n\nThe most pressing concern is king safety and development. Castling kingside (e8g8) seems most appealing as:\n- It moves the king towards safety\n- Connects the rooks\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Maintains control over e4\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- e8d8 would leave the king exposed to potential attacks\n- b8d7 doesn't address the immediate concerns\n- d4e5 allows White to play Qxh7\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
