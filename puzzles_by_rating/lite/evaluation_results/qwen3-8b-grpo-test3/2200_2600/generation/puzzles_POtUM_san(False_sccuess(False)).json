When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns. Black has a knight, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (e1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on g5 is well-placed. Black's knight on g6 is also active.\n\n4. Threats: Black's bishop on h4 is eyeing the h2 pawn. White's rook on g3 is protecting it.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f4g6: Capturing the knight with the knight\n- f4e6: Moving knight to e6\n- f4h5: Moving knight to h5\n- f4d5: Moving knight to d5\n- f4h3: Moving knight to h3\n- f4d3: Moving knight to d3\n- f4g2: Moving knight to g2\n- f4e2: Moving knight to e2\n- f1h3: Moving rook to h3\n- e5e6: Pushing the pawn\n\nThe most promising move is f4g6 (Nxg6), capturing the knight. This:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the f-file for White's rook\n- Removes a defender from g6\n- Maintains pressure on the position\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf4g6\n```"
