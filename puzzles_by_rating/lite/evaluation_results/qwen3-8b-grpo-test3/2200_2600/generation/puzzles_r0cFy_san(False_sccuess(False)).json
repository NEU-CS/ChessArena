When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a Rook, Queen, pawns. Black has a Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g7.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on e2 is attacking White's pawn on f2. White's queen on c7 is under attack by Black's bishop on f6.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c7e5: Queen move attacking the bishop\n- c7f4: Queen move attacking the rook\n- c7d6: Queen move protecting the rook\n- d8d7: Rook move attacking the queen\n- b5b6: Pawn push creating a passed pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on e2 attacking f2. If we don't address this, Black could play Re2xf2 winning the pawn.\n\nThe best move is to play c7e5, moving the queen to e5 where:\n- It attacks the bishop on f6\n- It protects the rook on d8\n- It maintains control over the e-file\n- It doesn't expose the queen further\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nc7e5\n```"
