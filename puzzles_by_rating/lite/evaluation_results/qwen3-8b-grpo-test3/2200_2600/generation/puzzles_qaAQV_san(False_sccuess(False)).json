Legal moves: Only g1h1 or g1f1 (king moves).\n\n- g1h1: Moves king towards the corner. Doesn't address the rook threat.\n- g1f1: Moves king towards the rook. This seems more defensive as it protects the rook on c1.\n\nThe immediate concern is the rook on d2 attacking the rook on c1. While neither king move directly addresses this, g1f1 is the better choice as it:\n- Moves the king closer to the action\n- Doesn't leave the king as exposed in the corner\n- Maintains some flexibility for future moves\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"
