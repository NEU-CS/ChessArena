Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns; Black has Rook, Bishop, Knight, pawns). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on f7, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's queen on d5 is very active. Black's queen on e5 is also active.\n\n4. Threats: White's rook on f2 is eyeing the f-file. Black's knight on c7 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e5e8: Queen takes rook - but White's rook isn't on e8\n- e5d6: Queen move attacking the knight\n- f5g6: Bishop move attacking the pawn\n- c7e6: Knight move attacking the queen\n- d5d4: Pawn push gaining space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on d5. The knight move c7e6 attacks the queen while also developing the knight to a better square. This move:\n- Attacks the queen\n- Opens the c1-h6 diagonal for the bishop\n- Doesn't weaken any pawns\n- Maintains control over d4\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc7e6\n```"
