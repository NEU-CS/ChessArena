When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a passed pawn on g4 that's advanced.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f3. Black's king is on d6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on a7 is attacking Black's pawn on a7. White's pawns on g4 and h4 are advanced and could promote.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b2b8: Captures the rook on a7\n- b2b7: Attacks the rook\n- b2b6: Moves the rook towards the king\n- Other moves don't address immediate threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is the rook on a7. If we don't capture it, White can play Ra1 or Rxa8. Therefore, we must capture the rook immediately.\n\n```\nb2b8\n```"
