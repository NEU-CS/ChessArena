When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a knight and bishop for a pawn (White has N+B, Black has only pawns). Materially, White is ahead.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f3. Black's king is on c7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a5, b3, b2. Black has pawns on a7, d5, e6, h5. The d5 pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on c5 is well-placed. Black's bishop on g4 is active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g4f5: Bishop takes pawn, but allows White's knight to capture the bishop\n- g4h3: Bishop move, but doesn't accomplish much\n- g4f3: Bishop takes pawn, attacking White's king\n- g4e2: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- g7g6: Pawn move, creating space for the king\n- e6e5: Pawn push, opening lines for the bishop\n- h5h4: Pawn push, gaining space\n- d5d4: Pawn push, but weakens the pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on c5, which is very active. The move e6e5 seems most promising as it:\n- Opens the e-file for Black's bishop\n- Creates space for Black's king to move\n- Potentially prepares d5d4 later\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't help or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6e5\n```"
