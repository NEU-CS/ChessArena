When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is exposed on f2. Black's king is on g4, close to White's pawns.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White's pawns are a3 and h2. Black has pawns on a6, b5, and g5. The b-pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f2g2: Moves king towards the h-pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f2e2: Moves king towards the center but still exposed\n- f2g1/f2f1/f2e1: All move the king towards the corner, but don't help\n- a3a4: Advances the a-pawn, creating space for the king\n- h2h3/h2h4: Advances the h-pawn, creating space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. Moving it towards the corner (f2e1) would:\n- Get it out of the open\n- Potentially allow it to support the a-pawn\n- Create space between the king and Black's pawns\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf2e1\n```"
