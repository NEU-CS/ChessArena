When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on g5 is eyeing the e4 pawn. Black's queen on h5 is close to White's king.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g1h2: Moves king towards the corner but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g1h1: Similar to h2\n- g1f1: Moves king towards the center but still exposed\n- e3g3: Pawn takes knight - this removes a threat and gains material\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on g5 which is attacking the e4 pawn. If we don't address it, Black could play Nxe4 winning the pawn.\n\ne3g3 (pawn takes knight):\n- Removes the knight threat\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the e-file for White's rook\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nThe other moves don't address the immediate threat to e4. Therefore, e3g3 is the best move.\n\n```\ne3g3\n```"
