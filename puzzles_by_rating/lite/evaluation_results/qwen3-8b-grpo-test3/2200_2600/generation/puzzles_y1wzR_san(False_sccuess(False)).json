When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f4. Black's king is on e2, also exposed.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on e6 is attacking Black's pawn on e4. White's queen on d8 is far from the action.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- a4d4: Queen takes rook - this wins the rook but allows White's queen to capture Black's queen\n- e2d3: King moves towards the center\n- e4e3: Pawn push - creates a passed pawn and opens lines for Black's queen\n- a1e5: Rook move - but there's no rook on a1\n\nThe most pressing concern is the e4 pawn under attack by the rook. If we don't defend it, White can play Re6xe4.\n\nThe best move is e4e3, advancing the pawn and creating a passed pawn while also opening lines for our queen. This also prevents Re6xe4 as the pawn would be protected by our king after e3.\n\n```\ne4e3\n```"
