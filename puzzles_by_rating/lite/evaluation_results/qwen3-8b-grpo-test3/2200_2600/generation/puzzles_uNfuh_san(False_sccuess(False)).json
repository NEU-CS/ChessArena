When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f3. Black's king is on f7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on c4, d4, f3, g2. Black has pawns on a7, d5, g5, h6. The d4 pawn is isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's queen is very active on h8. Black's queen is on a7.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- h8e5: Queen takes pawn, attacking the knight\n- h8d4: Queen takes pawn\n- f3g4: King move, but doesn't seem helpful\n- e4e5: Pawn push, but doesn't seem to help\n- c4c5: Pawn push, but doesn't seem to help\n\nThe most promising move is h8d4, capturing the pawn with the queen. This:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Opens the d-file for White's queen\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh8d4\n```"
