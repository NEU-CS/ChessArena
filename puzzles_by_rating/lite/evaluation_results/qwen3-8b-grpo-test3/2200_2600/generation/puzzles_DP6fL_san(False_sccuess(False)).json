Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is well-placed at d5. Black's king is at g5, also active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White's pawns: a2 is isolated, g3 is blocked by black's g4 pawn\n   - Black's pawns: b5 is isolated, h4 is advanced\n   - The pawns on the queenside (a2 vs a7) are potential targets\n\n4.

Moving the king towards it with d5c6 seems most logical as it:\n- Attacks the b5 pawn\n- Maintains control over the center\n- Doesn't expose the king to any threats\n\nOther moves:\n- d5d6 would leave the king too far from the action\n- g3g4 would open lines for black's pawns\n- a2a3/a2a4 don't address the immediate concerns\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5c6\n```"
