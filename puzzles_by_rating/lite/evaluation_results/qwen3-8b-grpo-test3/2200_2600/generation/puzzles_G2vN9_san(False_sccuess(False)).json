When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns. Black has a bishop, pawns, and a king that's quite active. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h4. Black's king is on e4, which is quite advanced.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a3, b4, g2, h2. Black has pawns on a5, b5, c6, d5, h5. The b-pawns are blocked.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on g6 is very active. Black's bishop on d1 is passive.\n\n5. Threats: Black's king is close to White's pawns. White needs to address this while maintaining piece activity.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- f6h8/f6d8/f6g7/f6e7: Bishop moves, but none seem to create immediate threats\n- f6g5: Attacks the h5 pawn but doesn't address the king\n- f6e5: Centralizes the bishop\n- f6d4: Attacks the d5 pawn\n- f6c3: Attacks the a3 pawn\n- f6b2: Attacks the a3 pawn\n- f6a1: Doesn't seem useful\n- h4g5: King move that captures the g5 pawn - this seems most promising as it:\n  - Removes a pawn from the board\n  - Opens the h-file for White's rook (though none exists yet)\n  - Moves the king away from potential checks\n  - Creates space for White's pieces\n\nThe other moves don't address the immediate concerns of king safety and pawn structure. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh4g5\n```"
