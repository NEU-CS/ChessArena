When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, bishop, pawns. Black has a queen, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on e3 is attacking the g2 bishop. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g2e4: Moves bishop to safety while attacking the knight\n- g2f3: Moves bishop to safety\n- g2h3: Moves bishop to safety\n- a7b8: Queen takes rook\n- a7a8: Queen move\n- d4d5: Pawn push\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight attacking the bishop. All bishop moves (g2e4, g2f3, g2h3) address this. Among them, g2e4 seems best because:\n- It moves the bishop to a central square\n- It attacks the knight\n- It opens the diagonal for the bishop\n- It doesn't expose the bishop to new threats\n\nOther moves like a7b8 (QxR) are tempting but premature since the knight is still attacking the bishop.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng2e4\n```"
