When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is exposed at d4. Black's king is at f7, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White has passed pawns at c5 and d5\n   - Black has pawns at b7, c6, d6 that block White's pawns\n   - The g-pawns are facing each other\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - f7e7: Moves king closer to the center\n   - g7g5: Advances the g-pawn to challenge White's g-pawn\n   - b7b5: Opens the b-file for Black's pawns\n   - h6h5: Advances the h-pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's passed pawns on c5 and d5. If they advance, they could become dangerous. Black needs to either:\n1) Block them with pawns, or\n2) Capture them with the king\n\nThe move b7b5 seems most promising as it:\n- Opens the b-file for Black's pawns to advance\n- Creates a passed pawn at b5 that can challenge White's pawns\n- Maintains flexibility for the king\n\nOther moves:\n- f7e7 is too passive\n- g7g5 allows White's g-pawn to advance\n- h6h5 doesn't address the main threats\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb7b5\n```"
