When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+B+R vs Black's R+N). White has a bishop on f6 that's very active.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on c1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on f6 is attacking the knight on e7. White's queen on d2 is eyeing the d-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e7f5: Moves the knight to defend the bishop on f6\n- e7d5: Centralizes the knight\n- c8e6: Develops the bishop to a active square\n- b6d5: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- h7h6: Gives the king an escape square\n\nThe most pressing concern is the bishop on f6 attacking the knight on e7. If we don't address this, White can win the knight.\n\ne7f5 seems most flexible:\n- It defends the bishop on f6\n- The knight on f5 is well-placed\n- It doesn't block the c8 bishop\n- It maintains control over d4\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- e7d5 leaves the knight passive\n- c8e6 doesn't address the immediate threat\n- b6d5 doesn't help with the bishop attack\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7f5\n```"
