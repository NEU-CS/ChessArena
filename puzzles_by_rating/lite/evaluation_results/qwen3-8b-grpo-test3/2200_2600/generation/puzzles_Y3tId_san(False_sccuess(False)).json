When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on b5 is attacking the knight on d5. White's knight on e4 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d5e3: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- d5f4: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- b2d4: Queen take pawn\n- e7c5: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- f6f5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on d5 under attack by the queen. If we don't address this, White can win the knight.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- d5e3 seems most flexible, moving the knight to safety while also eyeing the e1 pawn\n- b2d4 wins the pawn but leaves the knight vulnerable\n- e7c5 is interesting but doesn't solve the knight issue\n\nAfter considering all options, d5e3 seems like the most solid move, addressing the immediate threat while maintaining piece activity.\n\n```\nd5e3\n```"
