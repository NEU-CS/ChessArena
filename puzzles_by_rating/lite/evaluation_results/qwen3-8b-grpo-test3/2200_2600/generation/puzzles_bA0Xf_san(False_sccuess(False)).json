When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h4. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on b4 is attacking the a3 pawn. Black's queen on g6 is eyeing the g2 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- a3b4: Capturing the rook with the pawn seems most pressing - it wins the rook and opens the a-file for White's rook\n- e3c5: Bishop move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d5d6: Pawn push, but doesn't help\n- g2g3/g2g4: King moves to protect g2 pawn\n\nThe most forcing move is a3b4, capturing the rook. After this:\n- White wins the rook\n- The a-file opens for White's rook\n- Black's pawn structure is weakened\n- White can follow up with moves like Rd1-a1 or Bf2\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na3b4\n```"
