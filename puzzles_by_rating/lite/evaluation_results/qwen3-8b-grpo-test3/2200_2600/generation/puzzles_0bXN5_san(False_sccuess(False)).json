When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on e2. Black's king is on g3, close to White's king.\n\n3. Pawn structure: Black has two pawns (h4 and g3) that are advanced and threatening. White has no pawns left.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop is on g1. Black's pawns are blocking the bishop's movement.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e2f3: Moves king towards the pawns but exposes it to checks\n- e2e3: Moves king towards the pawns\n- e2d3: Moves king towards the pawns\n- e2d2: Moves king towards the pawns\n- e2f1: Moves king away from the pawns\n- e2e1: Moves king away from the pawns\n- e2d1: Moves king away from the pawns\n- g1a7: Bishop move but doesn't help\n- g1b6: Bishop move but doesn't help\n- g1c5: Bishop move but doesn't help\n- g1d4: Bishop move but doesn't help\n- g1e3: Bishop move that attacks the g3 pawn\n- g1h2: Bishop move but doesn't help\n- g1f2: Bishop move but doesn't help\n\nThe most pressing concern is the g3 pawn which is close to promotion. White needs to address this immediately.\n\nThe best move is g1e3, which:\n- Moves the bishop to e3 where it attacks the g3 pawn\n- Opens the diagonal for the bishop to potentially support the king\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or expose the king unnecessarily.\n\n```\ng1e3\n```"
