When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on d5. Black's king is on g7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has passed pawns on d4 and h5. Black has a pawn on f7 that could potentially promote.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's rook on g4 is well-placed. White's rook on g5 is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f7e6: This move attacks the white pawn on d4 and opens up the f-file for black's rook.\n- g4e4: This move attacks the white pawn on d4 and also threatens to capture it.\n- g4d4: This move captures the white pawn on d4.\n- g7g6: This move advances the pawn and creates space for the king.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to capture the d4 pawn with the rook. This move:\n- Wins material (the pawn)\n- Opens up the d-file for black's rook\n- Maintains pressure on white's position\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng4d4\n```"
