When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on b2 is attacking White's pawn on g2. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h3c8: Queen takes rook - but there's no rook on c8\n- h3d7: Queen move - but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h3e6: Queen move - same issue\n- h3f5: Queen move - same issue\n- h3g4: Queen move - same issue\n- f1f7: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1a6: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1f5: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1b5: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1f4: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1c4: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1f3: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1d3: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1f2: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1e2: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1h1: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1g1: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1e1: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1d1: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1c1: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1b1: Queen move - doesn't help\n- f1a1: Queen move - doesn't help\n- a4a5: Pawn move - doesn't help\n- g3g4: Pawn move - this seems most promising as it protects the king\n\nThe only move that addresses the immediate threat to the king is g3g4. This pawn move:\n- Protects the king from the queen on b2\n- Opens a escape square for the king on g3\n- Maintains control of the h4 square\n\nAll other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
