When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h4. Black's king is on f7, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on d4, c2, h3. Black has pawns on c6, d5, g5, h6. The d-pawns are blocked.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's bishop on e5 is very active. Black's bishop on f8 is passive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- f8g7: Bishop move, but doesn't accomplish much\n- f8e7: Same\n- f8d6: Attacks the e5 bishop\n- f8c5: Same\n- f8b4: Same\n- f8a3: Same\n- f7g8: King move, but why?\n- f7e8: King move, but why?\n- f7e7: King move, but why?\n- c6c5: Pawn push, opens line for bishop\n- g5g4: Pawn push, gains space and threatens h3 pawn\n\nThe most promising moves are c6c5 and g5g4. c6c5 opens the diagonal for the bishop and gains space. g5g4 is more aggressive, gaining space and threatening to open lines against White's king.\n\nAfter considering both, g5g4 seems more purposeful - it:\n- Gains space on the kingside\n- Threatens to open lines against White's king\n- Creates potential for a h4-h3 pawn break\n- Doesn't weaken Black's position\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5g4\n```"
