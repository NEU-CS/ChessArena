While none of the moves directly address this, g3g4 is the best option because:\n1. It moves the king away from potential checks\n2. It protects the rook on d2 indirectly (if the king moves to g4, the rook is protected by the king)\n3. It opens the g-file for White's queen to potentially defend the rook\n\nThe other moves don't help defend the rook or improve White's position. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
