When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material disadvantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on e8. White's king is on c1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on f3 is eyeing the f7 pawn. White's rook on c6 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- a2a4: Queen move attacking the pawn\n- a2e2: Queen move defending the e-file\n- e8e7: King move getting out of potential checks\n- f7f5: Pawn move creating space\n- a7e7: Rook move attacking the rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's rook on c6 which is very active. The move a7e7 (Rook takes rook) seems most forcing as it:\n- Captures the rook\n- Opens the e-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains pressure on the e-file\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na7e7\n```"
