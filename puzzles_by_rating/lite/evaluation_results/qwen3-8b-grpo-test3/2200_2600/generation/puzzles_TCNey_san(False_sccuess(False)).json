When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f2. Black's king is on f7.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a5, b4, d4, f3. Black has pawns on a6, b6, c5, d5, f5. The pawn structure is complex.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's queen is active on h5. Black's queen is on h6. Both queens are well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- h5h8: Queen takes rook (but there's no rook on h8)\n- h5h7: Attacks the king\n- h5g6: Moves queen towards the center\n- h5f5: Captures the pawn\n- f2e3: Moves king towards the center\n- b4b5: Pawn push\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be h5f5 (capturing the pawn) and f2e3 (improving king safety). \n\nh5f5 is particularly interesting because:\n- It wins a pawn\n- Opens the f-file for White's queen\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh5f5\n```"
