When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and king. White has a king, pawn on b4, and pawn on c2. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is on g6. White's king is on d5. Both kings are active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on b4 and c2. Black has no pawns. The b4 pawn is isolated and could be a target.\n\n4. Bishop activity: Black's bishop on b5 is well-placed, controlling the long diagonal.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- g6f5: King move towards the center\n- b5e2: Bishop move attacking the c2 pawn\n- b5d3: Bishop move controlling the c2 pawn\n- Other moves either don't improve the position or could be worse\n\nThe most pressing concern is the c2 pawn. If White pushes c2-c4, it could create a passed pawn. Therefore, we should focus on controlling this pawn.\n\nBetween b5e2 and b5d3, b5d3 is better because:\n- It controls the c2 pawn directly\n- It maintains flexibility for the bishop\n- It doesn't expose the bishop to potential attacks\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb5d3\n```"
