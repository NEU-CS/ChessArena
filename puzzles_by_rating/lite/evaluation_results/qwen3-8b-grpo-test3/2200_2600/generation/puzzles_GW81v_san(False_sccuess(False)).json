When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is still in the center (Kd1). Black's king is also in the center (Ke8).\n\n3. Threats: White has a knight on d6 that's very active. Black's knight on e5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e8f8: Moves king towards the corner, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e8d8: Moves king towards the queenside\n- e8e7: Moves king towards the center\n- e8d7: Moves king towards the center and protects the d6 knight\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on d6. If White plays Nxc8, White would win the rook. Therefore, we need to protect the knight or move it.\n\ne8d7 is the best move because:\n1. It moves the king towards the center\n2. It protects the knight on d6\n3. It maintains flexibility for future moves\n4. It doesn't expose the king to any new threats\n\nThe other moves either don't address the immediate threat or expose the king unnecessarily.\n\n```\ne8d7\n```"
