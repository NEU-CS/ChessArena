When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on b7.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on b2 is attacking White's pawn on c3. Black's rook on d2 is also a threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g2g3: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g2h1: Moves king towards the corner but away from the action\n- g2g1: Moves king towards the rook but still exposed\n- f3f2: Queen move attacking the rook\n- f3e2: Queen move protecting the c3 pawn\n- f1f2: Rook move attacking the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the c3 pawn and the exposed king. f3e2 seems most promising as it:\n- Protects the c3 pawn\n- Moves the queen towards the center\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf3e2\n```"
