When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is well-placed at c4. Black's king is at e5, also active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White's pawns are at a2, c2. Black has pawns at a7, b6, c6. The c-pawns are blocked.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c4b4: Moves king towards the a-pawn\n- c4d3: Moves king towards the c-pawn\n- c4c3: Moves king towards the c-pawn\n- b3b4: Pushes pawn, but it's already at b3\n- c2c3: Pushes pawn, but it's already at c2\n- a2a3: Pushes pawn, creates space\n- a2a4: More aggressive pawn push\n\nThe most promising moves are a2a3 or a2a4. a2a4 is more ambitious as it:\n- Creates space for the king to maneuver\n- Potentially opens lines for the king to attack the pawns\n- If the pawn reaches a5, it can support the c-pawn's advance\n\nOther moves don't improve the position. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na2a4\n```"
