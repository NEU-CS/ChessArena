When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight on e5, bishop on e2, knight on d5, pawns. Black has a knight on c5, bishop on c8, queen on d8, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is still in the center (g1). Black's king is also in the center (e8).\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on d5 is very active. Black's knight on c5 is also well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on d5 is attacking the pawn on e7. Black's knight on c5 is eyeing the pawn on d3.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- d5e7: Knight takes pawn, but allows Black's knight to capture d3 pawn\n- d5f6: Knight move, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n- d5b6: Knight move, but doesn't threaten anything\n- f1f7: Rook move, but doesn't seem to help\n- d2f3: Knight move, but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- d3d4: Pawn push, gaining space and protecting the knight on d5\n\nThe most pressing concern is protecting the knight on d5 while also gaining space. The move d3d4 accomplishes both:\n\n- It protects the knight on d5\n- It gains space in the center\n- It opens lines for White's pieces\n- It doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd3d4\n```"
