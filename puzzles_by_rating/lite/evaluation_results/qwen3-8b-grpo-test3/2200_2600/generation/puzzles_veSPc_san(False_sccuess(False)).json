When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q+R vs Black's R+R+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on c4 is attacking Black's pawn on d6. White's queen on d3 is eyeing the d-file.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b4d2: Queen takes pawn, but White can simply take with the knight\n- b4e1: Queen move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d7e6: Bishop move, but doesn't help\n- e8e4: Rook move, but White's knight is still on c4\n- g7g6: Pawn move, creates some space for the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's knight on c4 attacking the d6 pawn. If the knight captures the pawn (Nxd6), White will be up a pawn and Black's position will be further weakened.\n\nThe best move is to capture the knight with the bishop:\n\n```\nd7c6\n```\n\nThis:\n1. Captures the knight\n2. Opens the c-file for Black's rook\n3. Maintains control over e4\n4. Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, d7c6 is the most principled move in the position."
