When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+R vs Black's R+B). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on e8.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on f4 is attacking the bishop on g6. White's queen on f3 is eyeing the f7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b4e7: Bishop takes knight, winning the knight\n- b4d6: Bishop move, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b4c5: Bishop move, but again doesn't help\n- e8e4: Rook move, but doesn't help\n- f8g7: Rook move, but doesn't address threats\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on f4 attacking the bishop on g6. If we don't address this, White can play Nxd5 or Nxd5 followed by Nxe6.\n\nThe best move is to capture the knight with the bishop:\n\n```\nb4e7\n```\n\nThis move:\n- Wins the knight\n- Opens the e7 square for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over d5\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new problems. Therefore, b4e7 is the most principled move in the position."
