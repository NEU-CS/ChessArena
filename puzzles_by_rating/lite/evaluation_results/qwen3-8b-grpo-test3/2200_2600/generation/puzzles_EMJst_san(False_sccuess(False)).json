When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g1.\n\n3. Threats: White's knight on e6 is attacking Black's pawn on d5. White's bishop on g3 is eyeing the h2 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e2e6: Capturing the knight with the rook seems most pressing. This wins the knight and opens the e-file for Black's rook.\n- Other moves like c4f4 or f7g6 don't address the immediate threat to the knight.\n- e2e6 also prepares potential counterplay against White's queen on c6.\n\n5. After e2e6:\n- If White takes the rook with Qxe6, Black can play Bxe6 winning the knight.\n- If White doesn't take, Black can consider moves like f7g6 or c4f4.\n\nOther moves don't seem to improve Black's position as much. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne2e6\n```"
