When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a passed pawn on e7 that's very advanced.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on f3. Black's king is on h7.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on d6 is attacking Black's bishop on d4. White's bishop on g5 is eyeing the h6 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4e7: Capturing the pawn with the rook seems most pressing as it removes the advanced pawn threat\n- d4e5: Moving the bishop to defend the e7 pawn\n- g7h8: Moving the king towards the center\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threats\n\nThe most urgent concern is the e7 pawn which is one square from promotion. If we don't capture it, White will promote next move. Therefore, the best move is to capture the pawn with the rook:\n\n```\ne4e7\n```"
