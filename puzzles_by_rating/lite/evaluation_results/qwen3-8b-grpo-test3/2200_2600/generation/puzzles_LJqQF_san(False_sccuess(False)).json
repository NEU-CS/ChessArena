When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+P vs Black's R+P). White has a passed pawn on g6 that's advanced.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on c1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on e3 is eyeing the e-file. Black's knight on d4 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- d4e6: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- a5e1: Queen move attacking the rook\n- c6e7: Knight move attacking the pawn\n- d6d5: Pawn push opening the center\n- g6g5: Pushing the passed pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's advanced g6 pawn which could promote. While it's not immediately threatening, it's a long-term concern.\n\nThe move d6d5 seems most principled:\n- Opens the center\n- Creates space for Black's pieces\n- Prepares potential e5 push\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves:\n- a5e1 wins the rook but allows White to push g6-g7\n- d4e6 leaves the knight exposed\n- c6e7 doesn't address the g6 pawn\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd6d5\n```"
