When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on c8.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a7, f2, g2, h2. Black has pawns on d3, f5, g6. The a7 pawn is advanced and could be promoted.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's Rook on e7 is very active. Black's Bishop on c4 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e7e8: Rook promotion threat\n- e7h7: Attacks the h7 pawn\n- e7g7: Attacks the g6 pawn\n- e7f7: Attacks the f5 pawn\n- e7d7: Attacks the d3 pawn\n- e7e6: Moves towards the king\n- e7e5: Moves towards the center\n- e7e4: Moves towards the bishop\n- e7e3: Moves towards the d3 pawn\n- e7e2: Moves towards the pawns\n- e7e1: Moves towards the king\n- g1g2: Moves the king towards safety\n- g3g4: Pawn push\n- h2h3/h2h4: Pawn pushes\n- f2f3/f2f4: Pawn pushes\n\nThe most pressing concern is the a7 pawn which is one square from promotion. Black's king is too far away to stop it. Therefore, promoting the pawn should be the priority.\n\nThe move e7e8 (Rook to e8) prepares to support the a7 pawn's promotion while also controlling the e-file. This move also threatens to promote the a7 pawn next move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
