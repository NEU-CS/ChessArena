When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is exposed on a6. White's king is on d3, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - Black has passed pawns on e5 and f5\n   - White has a passed pawn on d4\n   - The h-pawns are facing each other\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - a6b7: Moves king towards the center but away from the pawns\n   - a6a7: Moves king towards the corner\n   - a6b6: Moves king towards the center\n   - a6a5: Moves king towards the pawns\n   - h5g4: Captures the g4 pawn\n   - f5g4: Captures the g4 pawn\n   - f7f6: Advances the f-pawn\n   - h5h4: Advances the h-pawn\n   - f5f4: Advances the f-pawn\n   - e5e4: Advances the e-pawn\n\nThe most pressing concerns are:\n1. White's d4 pawn is advanced and could be dangerous\n2. Black's king needs to be more active\n3. The h-pawns are locked and need resolution\n\nThe best move is e5e4. This:\n- Opens the e-file for Black's king to move towards the center\n- Creates a passed e-pawn\n- Opens lines for Black's pawns to advance\n- Maintains control over d4\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5e4\n```"
