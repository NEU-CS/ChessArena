If we don't address this, White can win the rook.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- g8g7 (Rook takes rook) seems forced - otherwise White wins the rook\n- After g8g7, White's rook is gone but White's queen remains powerful\n- Other moves don't address the immediate threat\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the rook with:\n\n```\ng8g7\n```"
