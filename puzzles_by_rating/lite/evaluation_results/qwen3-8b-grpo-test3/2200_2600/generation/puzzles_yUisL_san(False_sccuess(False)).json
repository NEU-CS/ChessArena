When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Rook, Bishop, Knight vs Black's Rook, Knight). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on d2. Black's king is on c6, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's rook on d4 is very active. Black's rook on e6 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c6c7: King moves towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c6b6: King moves towards the queenside\n- c6c5: King moves towards the center\n- c6b5: King moves towards the queenside\n- e7d5: Knight takes the rook - this wins the rook\n- e5d5: Rook takes the rook - this also wins the rook\n- e5e4: Rook moves forward\n\nThe most forcing move is e7d5 (knight takes rook), which wins the rook outright. After this:\n- If White plays Qxg6, Black can play Nxf4\n- If White does nothing, Black can play Nxf4 next move\n- This significantly reduces White's material advantage\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or leave White with too much material. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7d5\n```"
