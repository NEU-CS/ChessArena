When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, rook, pawns.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on h5, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: Black's queen on f4 is attacking the g4 pawn. White's queen on e7 is attacking the h7 pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h5h6: Moves the king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f4g4: Captures the pawn with the queen, opening lines for Black's pieces\n- f5g4: Also captures the pawn but with the pawn instead of the queen\n\nThe best move is f4g4 because:\n1. It captures the pawn with the queen, maintaining control over g4\n2. It opens the f-file for Black's rook\n3. It doesn't leave the queen exposed like f5g4 would\n4. It maintains pressure on White's position\n\nThe other moves don't address the immediate threat to the g4 pawn or improve Black's position.\n\n```\nf4g4\n```"
