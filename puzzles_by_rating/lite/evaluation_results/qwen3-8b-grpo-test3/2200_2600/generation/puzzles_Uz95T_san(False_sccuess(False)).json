When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+B+N, Black has B+N). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on e8 with some protection.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's bishop on e4 is very active. Black's knight on e5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White has a passed pawn on e4 that could promote. Black needs to address this.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e5f3: Knight move attacking the queen\n- e5d3: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- e8g8: Castling kingside to safety\n- g6g5: Pawn push creating space\n- e5f7: Knight move attacking the queen\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's e4 pawn. If it promotes, White will have a decisive material advantage. Therefore, we need to address this immediately.\n\nThe best move is e5d3, attacking the bishop on c1. This:\n- Protects the e4 pawn\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n- Doesn't allow White to push e4-e5\n\nOther moves either don't address the e4 pawn or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5d3\n```"
