When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on e4 is attacking White's knight on f3. Black's knight on d5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e1e5: Rook move attacking the knight\n- c3d5: Knight takes knight\n- f3e5: Knight move\n- d3e4: Rook takes rook\n- c5d6: Bishop move\n\nThe most forcing move is d3e4, capturing the rook. This:\n- Wins the rook\n- Opens the e-file for White's rook\n- Removes a defender from e4\n- Maintains pressure on the knight on d5\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd3e4\n```"
