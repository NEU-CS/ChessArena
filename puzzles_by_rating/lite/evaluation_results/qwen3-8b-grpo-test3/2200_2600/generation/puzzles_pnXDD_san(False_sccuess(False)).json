When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is on c7, White's king is on c5. Both kings are active.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - White's pawns: c5, f4, h4\n   - Black's pawns: e6, f6, h5\n   - The c5 pawn is isolated and could be a target\n   - The h-pawns are facing each other\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - c7d8: King moves towards the corner\n   - c7c8: King moves to the back rank\n   - c7b8: King moves towards the queenside\n   - c7d7: King moves towards the center\n   - c7b7: King moves towards the queenside\n   - f6f5: Pawn push towards the center\n   - e6e5: Pawn push towards the center\n\nThe most promising moves are the pawn pushes f6f5 and e6e5, as they:\n- Gain space in the center\n- Open lines for the black king to approach\n- Potentially create passed pawns\n\nBetween the two, e6e5 seems slightly better because:\n- It opens the e-file for the black king\n- It doesn't block the f-pawn's advance\n- It creates a potential passed pawn on e5\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne6e5\n```"
